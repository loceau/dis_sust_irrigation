The IRM allows reallocation of a portion of undisbursed balances of IDA-financed investment projects for recovery and reconstruction support following a formal Government request in the event of an eligible emergency. With IDA’s support, Cambodia is developing its Emergency Response Manual (ERM). The ERM will detail eligible uses, financial management, procurement, safeguard and any other necessary implementation arrangements for the IDA IRM. The preparation and acceptance of the ERM is a condition prior to disbursement of any funds reallocated to this component. In the event that the IDA IRM is activated using funding through this contingent emergency response component, the project development objective (PDO) and results framework may be amended as needed through a formal restructuring to reflect the provision of immediate and effective response to the eligible crisis or emergency.

Rwanda is increasingly recognized as a global example in the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and in preparing for the global challenges of climate change. Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) has prepared its fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA4), an articulation of how the government proposes to implement the updated National Agricultural Policy (NAP). PSTA4 is also aligned with National Policies and Strategies including Vision 2050, Rwanda’s National Strategy for Transformation (NST 1), and relevant sub-sector strategies. This Program for Results (PforR) operation will be nested within PSTA4. Reflecting emerging best-practice with PforR operations, the specifics of the PforR Program are drawn from the broader PSTA4 and nested within the government’s strategy. The PforR operation directly addresses the objectives of the World Bank’s engagement in Rwanda and capitalizes on the World Bank’s comparative advantage. It is aligned with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY2014 – 2020), particularly in improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural development and social protection, by supporting investments in activities that promote agricultural productivity, agribusiness and nutrition. This PforR Program’s four results areas would address areas reflect the Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) concept by focusing on the overall policy context (Results Area 1), recognizing that a key element of the new NAP/PSTA4 is leveraging private sector investment in the commercialization agenda (Results Area 2), but that there remains a need for the public provision of services alongside the greater use of private sector delivery mechanisms (Results Area 3), and that where public provision remains, improving the effectiveness of those public services including value chain infrastructure is key (Results Area 4)

The changes in project implementation place greater emphasis on rural livelihoods, both agricultural and non-farm based, to ensure immediate and direct interventions targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable in conflict-affected communities, whom for the most part had been largely excluded from planning and implementation of project activities.",P086747.IDA46710.crs5,Sri Lanka,2009,1.30E+06,"USD, constant 2020",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PRODEX aims at adequately addressing the numerous constraints that continue to hinder the competitiveness of supply chains and the development of agriculture and livestock in Niger. The proposed Additional Financing would help finance the costs associated with the scaling up of PRODEX activities, with a view to securing a higher level of Development Objective achievements over an additional two-year project implementation period. The AF will enhance the project impact by expanding its coverage to a larger group of emerging market-oriented small and medium enterprises in project-targeted agriculture and livestock Value Chains. Project impact will also be enhanced by laying the groundwork for a sound exit strategy and strong sustainability.

Two of the pillars of the proposed operation are directly linked to two of the “Big Four” priorities (affordable housing - pillar 1; and farmer incomes and food security– pillar 2), while the other pillars address foundational issues that underpin the achievement of the “Big Four” and the broader inclusive growth agenda. The choice of the two pillars of direct focus in the proposed operation reflects a combination of factors including potential impact on the poor, available analytical evidence to underpin reforms, level of existing World Bank engagement in the respective areas, including complementarity with other World Bank projects, appropriateness of instruments to address the identified challenges, and reform momentum by the Kenyan Government.The third and fourth pillar of this proposed operation are foundational and will be critical for all four of the government’s priority areas and the broader inclusive growth agenda.The current operation benefits from strong government engagement, as it is well situated within the stated “Big Four” priorities of the government.The CPS has three domains of engagement: (i) competitiveness and sustainability – growth to eradicate poverty; (ii) protection and potential – human resource development for shared prosperity; and (iii) consistency and equity – delivering a devolution dividend.This DPF complements the World Bank’s support to Kenya being provided through Investment Project Financing (IPF) and Program for Results (PforR) operations.

PRSC are well-suited to address the challenges Vietnam currently faces. This operation aims to maintain the momentum for the reforms needed to transform Vietnam from a transition to a middle-income country. Emerging from massive poverty at the launching of Doi Moi in 1986, Vietnam is now on the verge of becoming a middle-income country. There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, in the government's drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder economy and further integrating with the region and the world. Over these years, comprehensive economic reforms have led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on poverty reduction and other development outcomes. The share of the population living below the poverty line fell by nearly half, from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are from disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic minorities) or live in more isolated regions. Attaining middle-income status is seen as more than a threshold level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, but as a way to emphasize the need for a set of modern institutions. It entails further financial deepening to support capital mobilization, the regulation of access to and pricing of infrastructure services, the gradual development of modern social insurance, more effective tools for environmental protection, legal and judiciary reforms, and the effective governance, among others. The SEDP 2006-2010 approved in June 2006 articulates this vision. As this PRSC cycle draws close to the end, the Government of Vietnam and development partners have approached the World Bank to discuss possible successor operations to PRSC. The form of such operations is still under discussion, but one possibility is an overarching instrument, which is focused on macroeconomic and a few cross-cutting issues, accompanied with more in-depth sectoral development policy operations, which would drill down to second generation reforms. A preparatory study is currently underway for this purpose. The World Bank is committed to providing assistance in a broad spectrum of areas, including social sectors, even as the country joins the ranks of middle-income countries. Studies of other countries' experiences and in-depth analysis of debt management and sustainability are currently conducted jointly with the government so as to find the best partnership strategy for the country for the coming years.",P111182.IDA47820.crs8,Viet Nam,2010,1.70E+07,"USD, constant 2020",,2,1,,,,,,,1,http://projects.worldbank.org/P111182/vietnam-poverty-reduction-support-credit-9?lang=en,,2,P111182,1,,2,1,,1,,1,Not specific about irrigation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The previous series, however, could not be resumed since more than 24 months had elapsed after Board approval of the last operation. A stand-alone development policy operation (DPO) was attempted in 2015, but a potential debt arising from a Memorandum of Understanding signed with a Chinese company prevented the World Bank from going forward. This issue has also been satisfactorily resolved. During this period, the country also signed a revised Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2015, which anchors the short-term fiscal consolidation efforts and includes structural benchmarks on financial stability and measures to address the fiscal imbalance coming from the energy sector. The objective of this operation is to help the Government introduce growth-enabling reforms in the financial sector, business environment, and infrastructure; generate fiscal resources and savings; and improve quality of expenditures. A key focus of government policy is to reduce the dependence on government spending and facilitate the development of alternative growth drivers. This operation will help facilitate this shift by supporting policies that are aimed to address the risks to growth both directly and indirectly. The first pillar of the operation focuses on policies aimed to deal with direct risks to growth such as inadequate frameworks for credit operations and unreliable energy supply. The second pillar brings together policies that will indirectly help mitigate risks to growth.

There are four components to the project. The first component is climate resilient agriculture. This component will support climate-resilient approaches that allows for the sustainable use of the natural resource base through agricultural and livestock production systems aiming to increase long term productivity and farm incomes in an environment marked by increased climate and, in particular, rainfall variability. Agrarian households in rural Rajasthan face tremendous challenges even with the existing levels of climate variability, let alone those that may come with future changes in climate. This is often referred to as an adaptation deficit. Thus the package of options in this component is based on a strategy that is robust under any future climate scenario and focuses on ways of overcoming this existing adaptation deficit as a necessary step towards longer term climate resilience. The second component is markets and value chains. The objective of this component is to enable farmers to engage in profitable market oriented production, that is sustainable, and to promote partnerships and market linkages with other value chain participants and agribusinesses. The component will help producer groups, agro enterprises, and commodity associations, to actively engage in the development of commodity value chains by partially financing demand-driven investment proposals to producer organization through a matching grant. The third component is farmer's organizations and capacity building. This component will support (a) mobilization and establishment of farmer groups and organizations, (b) capacity building for participatory planning and plan implementation of collective actions; and (c) strengthening of institutions and human resources associated with the project implementation.

The GoJ¿s policy is to promote the formation and functioning of Water User Associations (WUAs) as legal entities with farmers as members and shareholders who will have the power to govern these organizations. Responsibility for local management of water distribution, monitoring and system maintenance will be assumed eventually by the WUAs. The IDB funded projects are currently at a stage where wells are drilled and the beneficiaries are getting ready to commence the production and management of their respective schemes, albeit on a small scale until full transfer is given.The ability to garner knowledge and understanding of irrigation and management practices in the WUA context and the exchange of ideas bring benefits to both the host and visiting institutions, and can develop into working collaborations.

The project has simple techniques, which can be adopted very easily by the beneficiaries, and centres on the control of surface water. The proposed approach is intended to encourage local initiative and self-promotion of rural areas, within a secure land system in which farmers and grazers can work together in harmony. It also complies with the options of the regional economic and social development plan for Zinder for the 2000-2004 period; the plan contains activities for rural areas to restore and protect productive bases. The project concerns a region in Niger that has been extremely hard hit by drought and environmental degradation, but which nevertheless abounds with great potentials of undeveloped arable lands and available labour. The project will focus its operations on agricultural and pastoral development, and create favourable conditions for using runoff water. The proposed developments (micro-dams, water spreading thresholds, deep ponds, etc.) will facilitate water spreading and infiltration, thereby creating favourable conditions for intensive production of crops and livestock, without upsetting the farmers’ habits. The project is also intended to provide specific assistance to the most vulnerable groups, whose major concerns are food insecurity and low incomes of households. By giving priority to simple techniques that can be adopted by poor people, the project will eliminate the uncertainty and risk factors on the lives of the rural population who are often forced to develop survival strategies during periods of food shortage. Carrying out special activities for women would improve their living conditions by reducing the time and difficulty of their housework and by increasing their incomes.

The project is in line with the integrated irrigated agricultural development programme aimed at revitalizing farming activities in the River Senegal valley. It aims at the rehabilitation of 3,400 ha of basins suitable for flood recession crop cultivation with the cleansing of the water supply channels. Some forty vegetable growing blocks tended by women and totaling 110 ha. will be rehabilitated. The envisaged support to land development will translate into measures to guarantee quality production and ensure optimal management of production systems. To this end, the project will build the capacities of farmer organizations and provide agricultural advisory services in the area of crop production and farm management. The main components are as follows: (A) Irrigation schemes, (B) Development, and (C) Project Management. The five-year project will be executed for a total, excluding taxes and customs duties, estimated at UA 5.06 billion, or UA 12.83 million.

The key impediments to more inclusive growth are insufficient transport and other basic infrastructure, including irrigation, water supply and wastewater treatment, and rural roads as well as limited institutional capacity. To improve the efficiency in public investment and benefit from economies of scale and synergies with ongoing or planned projects, the Government is increasingly advocating for the integrated area approach under which neighboring localities work toward common development goals and jointly enhance their competitiveness. The integrated area development approach was also recommended by the Viet Nam Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Final Review Validation, 2012 2015, conducted by ADB s Independent Evaluation Department, as a means to ensure synergies among and maximize inclusion and other development impacts of projects.

Seasonal water shortages caused by low and erratic annual rainfall patterns and sandy and fragile soils that are at high risk of water and wind erosion limit paddy rice cultivation, render rainfed agriculture a high risk endeavor, and contribute to low agricultural production. Under such uncertain climatic and rainfall conditions, the provision of functional canal irrigation systems is critical to safeguarding crops.The Government has prioritized irrigation investments to enhance agricultural production and improve water utilization?constructing over 233 dams and weirs, 327 pumping stations, and 8,032 tube wells, focused primarily in the CDZ.  Many of these irrigation schemes were built before the 1980s and have operated for 30 years. These schemes need to be rehabilitated, redesigned and upgraded to meet changing demands and uses. The proposed Irrigation Command Area Development Project (the project) will result in increased agricultural productivity and incomes through the provision and improved management of irrigated agriculture in the CDZ region. The project will rehabilitate and modernize irrigation infrastructure in the CDZ and strengthen institutional capacities for improved irrigation management from the national level down to irrigation water user groups (WUGs) at the farm level.",LN3477-MYA,Myanmar,2017,9975000,"USD, constant 2020",,2,1,,,,,,,1,https://www.adb.org/projects/47152-002/main,Loan,2,47152-002,2,2016,2,1,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,Reports and Recommendations of the President,2,"129,990,000",USD,Source of Funding / Amount,,,1,,,,2,,1,Crop yields,Poverty incidence reduced,Cropping intensity,Area under irrigation,,DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK ,1,0,0,

The proposed investment program includes three tranches encompassing generation expansion and associated transmission and distribution improvements.  Tranche 1 mainly focuses on generation expansion. Tranche 2 focuses on transmission and distribution improvement together with a pilot solar irrigation component.  Tranche 3 also invests on generation expansion. Generation expansion in the MFF will be undertaken through supply side energy efficiency improvement so that about 50% power can be generated without burning additional gas. Given the acute gas shortages in Bangladesh, conversion of single cycle gas fired power plants to combined cycle plants   the technology adopted in the investment program    is the best way to expand the generation capacity. The sequencing of the tranches is well aligned with the sector needs and the government program. The Tranche 1 of the proposed Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program will address two key areas in the power sector aligning with the priorities identified in the CPS: improving energy use efficiency of thermal power plants, and improving the transmission network capacity.  The project interventions will include: (i) adding 235 MW capacity by conversion of four single cycle gas fired power plants to combine cycle plants at Khulna, Baghabari, Sylhet  and Shahjibazar, (ii) construction of 180 km 132 kV transmission lines and four 133/32 kV substations, and (iii) capacity building.

The Project will provide credit and training to about 66,000 farm households in 26 counties of five municipalities in central and southern Shanxi. Of these, 11 are poverty counties and 12 are on the priority list for treatment of accelerated soil erosion in the PRC. The Project comprises four components (i) transition to high-value farm production by adopting technologies and practices that ensure environmental sustainability and increase farm income, (ii) strengthening of farm-market linkages by supporting on-farm and industrial agroprocessing and marketing of high-value products, (iii) capacity-building and training of farmers, farmer associations, and technical support agencies to support high-value production and processing of farm products, and (iv) project management to support efficient project implementation. To keep project implementation manageable, each participating county will take up two of the three activities in the first component-perennial crops, annual crops, and livestock. Structured criteria were used to select project counties, sites, and activities.The Project will build the capacity of farmers, their associations, and staff of technical support agencies (TSAs) to adopt high-value and environmentally sustainable production systems that will increase farmer incomes and farm productivity, and improve food safety and quality.

The Project will benefit about 600,000 farm households and improve the production capacity of about 120,000 hectares (ha) in 27 counties, cities, and districts. The Project will adopt a farm-to-market, value-chain approach that creates value for poor farmers, local agroenterprises, and consumers. It will introduce highvalue horticulture crops and improved crop and livestock management, farm technologies, and cultivation practices. Organic fertilizers and agrochemicals will be more effectively used and the quality of farm produce improved through support services provided by participating private agroenterprises. These include soil-testing facilities, agricultural extension and technology transfer centers, organic fertilizer facilities, machinery service centers, seed production centers, agricultural produce information centers, product-testing centers, and expanded horticulture markets.The Project will develop about 29 partnerships between private agroenterprises and farmers using contract farming arrangements to strengthen farm productivity, and food production and processing capacity to take advantage of growing domestic and international markets. Sustainable production and processing partnerships according to the dragon-head concept will be used to develop crops and other outputs that are processed and marketed by the enterprise. The dragon-head agribusiness structure is a successful, vertically integrated enterprise model that has demonstrated the capacity to contract with a large number of farmers to improve rural incomes through value-chain linkages and efficiencies, access to higher-value markets, and employment opportunities.The agroenterprises were selected using strict selection criteria and due diligence assessment of financial, economic, environmental, and social factors. They will be provided with long-term financing to expand their food processing and marketing operations.Farmers will diversify and modify their existing traditional cultivation of low-yielding and low-value food crops to higher-yielding and highervalue crops. Their partnerships with profitable and expanding agroenterprises will ensure them higher prices for their outputs, premium prices for quality, and a guaranteed price at harvest time. Farmers' average income will increase by an estimated 15%-25% as a result of the Project. Technological improvements include (i) adopting high-yielding varieties and improved animal breeds, conservation agriculture techniques such as returning crop residues to the soil, minimum tillage, and soil conservation measures, water-harvesting techniques such as storage tanks, lined wells, and small check dams, and water-saving technologies such as drip irrigation, sprinklers, and pipes, (ii) minimizing the use of chemical fert",LN2474-PRC,China (People's Republic of),2009,,"USD, constant 2020",,2,1,,,,,,,1,https://www.adb.org/projects/38301-013/main,,2,38301-013,2,2008,2,1,,1,,2,Cannot determine how much goes to irrigation-relatec activities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It directly supports the Government of Viet Nam's (Government) National Target Program for New Rural Development (NRD). The PRI has deteriorated because of limited funding available for new investment and a constrained capacity to sustainably develop, manage and use the assets. This contributes to CHP's poverty by constraining rural productivity. The Project would focus on sustainably improving approximately 30 medium scale irrigation systems, and associated PRI including: rural access infrastructure, and, local markets.  In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the 30 subprojects would be selected from CHP's Socio-Economic Development Plans.  The improved PRI is expected to enable communities to respond to market signals by: increasing agricultural intensity and diversity, providing quicker and safer access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services, and, reducing costs of rural production and marketing, as well as reducing food wastage. Improved PRI increases incomes from both on- and off-farm employment, decreases the burden of chores on women, and increases food availability even when yields are constant. This is pro-poor and will be increasingly important for climate change resilience (CCR). The Project advances two key, Government supported innovations. The first innovation enhances PRI sustainability and includes good practice, which has previously not been systematically implemented by: (i) concentrating a critical mass of PRI investments in selected productive areas, (ii) having the communities prioritize the PRI improvements in and around the selected irrigation schemes, (iii) preparing PRI condition inventories and a program to update them, (iv) using whole asset life analysis with realistic maintenance assumptions as the basis for design and sustainable management, (v) improving trails and paths within the irrigation systems thus separating pedestrians and cyclists who are often women and children from motorized traffic and reducing the loss of productive land, and (vi) incorporating bio-engineering for soil and water conservation in the design thus stabilizing the local ecosystems and improving CCR. The second innovation is multi-level capacity building measures (CBM) that are gender sensitive to assist stakeholders (owners, managers and users) to sustainably develop, manage and use PRI. The CBM will have three key components: (i) Preparation of a long-term capacity building strategy, (ii) Strengthening local capacity to manage the PRI improved by the Project, and (iii) Building the local knowledge base for sustainable PRI development.

The approach was institutionalized at the provincial level through mainstreaming strategies and an action plan to ensure investment and financial flows for sustainable land management (SLM) and livelihood activities. SLM practices applied in the pilots and investment programs included reforestation, soil erosion control measures, greenhouses for vegetable production, mulching, grazing management, and irrigation control. These practices were implemented alongside rural infrastructure, rural energy, biogas, solar energy, and other development activities that contributed to income generation and improved livelihoods in the pilot sites. These activities were supported by policy actions, legislation, thematic studies, capacity development, and knowledge management. Many technical and institutional aspects of the implementation and management of the partnership require further updating to meet the increasing demand for support and investments at the local levels. The government and partners have identified the following development issues that need to be addressed for the partnership to successfully continue: (i) the need to focus on replication and up-scaling of the achievements of the partnership, with a strong emphasis on investments at the provincial level, (ii) the need to target capacity development and its linkage to demonstration and investment activities, (iii) the need for a broader financial resource mobilization strategy, taking into consideration government, private sector, and development partner resources, as well as innovative mechanisms such as eco-compensation programs, and (iv) the need for the program to have a stronger link with the PRC National Action Plan for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and close alignment with the secretariat of the PRC National Committee for implementation of the UNCCD in the State Forestry Administration (SFA).Building on the progress made by the partnership since 2002, the government requested support to prepare a new framework that will guide the implementation of future activities under the partnership.

Chongqing is one of four centrally-administered municipalities of the People?s Republic of China (PRC). Located in the upper middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Chongqing is a part of the less-developed western region which is targeted by the PRC?s national preferential policies under the National Strategy for Development of the West (NSDW). Although the NSDW has contributed to double Chongqing?s gross domestic product (GDP) in the past five years, economic benefits have been unevenly distributed due to Chongqing?s topographical characteristics of vast hinterlands and predominantly hilly and mountainous terrain.  In Chongqing, a few rapidly developing central districts co-exist with poverty-stricken peripheral counties, and widening development gaps among districts and counties.  Within districts and counties, imbalanced socioeconomic development is also increasingly evident where urban expansion meets rural areas. The urban-rural average income gap increased to 3.4 times in 2010 and 1.45 million people live below the designated poverty line of CNY1,400 per annum. In accordance with the national and municipal strategic priorities, Chongqing has shifted its focus from traditional centralized urban development to balanced urban?rural development.  However, many rural villages, small towns and cities still struggle with poor basic infrastructures. In addition to insufficient rural road access and limited water supply provision, frequent flooding in second and third-tier cities becomes a clear development hindrance. The Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG) is focusing on improving basic urban infrastructures and closing inter- and intra-district and county development gaps. The rationale for the project is to support CMG?s efforts to (i) reduce flooding risks to enhance urban safety, improve local environment and support the development of small towns and cities, (ii) provide safe drinking water to improve local health conditions in peri-urban areas, (iii) expand all-weather roads, thereby improving accessibility to basic social services and economic activities in rural areas, (iv) improve investment climate of project districts and counties, and (v) develop capacity to achieve balanced urban and rural development and management.",TA7858-PRC,China (People's Republic of),,0,"USD, constant 2020",,2,1,,,,,,,1,https://www.adb.org/projects/45509-001/main,,2,45509-001,2,2011,2,1,,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
