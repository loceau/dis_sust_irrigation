The contribution of the project is to improve the health of the population and prevent diseases caused by dirty drinking water and uncleanliness, for example diarrhoea and cholera. Dirty and polluted drinking water and poorly finished toilets also attract insects such as mosquitoes, which greatly increases the risk of malaria infection.Efforts are being made to improve access to clean drinking water, increase residents' awareness of the value of hygiene and equip toilets in the villages. This will be done by installing water and sanitation systems where requested. The project is based on the participation of all residents, but special emphasis is placed on the participation of women who are mostly responsible for transporting and manage water. This is an attempt to ensure the sustainability of the project and that the knowledge is retained among the locals after the disappearance of the assistance.The main objective of the project is to reduce water- and hygiene-related diseases in the area. The aim is that sanitation facilities will have been improved substantially and the inhabitants in the area been given access to potable water within 500m of their homes.The project includes providing access to clean potable water to a population of 100.000.
