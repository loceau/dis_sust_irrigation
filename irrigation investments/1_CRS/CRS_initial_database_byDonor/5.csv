A system had to be established first, to collect that water from households manually as no other drainage-system had currently been available. Costs were covered by the State of Northrhine-Westphalia (NRW) through Engagement Global gGmbH, co-financed by the WBH (only the proportion of the share of NRW is recorded here). Based on that knowledge and the existing plant for demonstration-purposes located in the Capital of Burkina Faso, the WBH was asked for assistance in building and maintaining such purification-plants on the premises of two schools in rural areas. Besides purifying used water, a major goal is to teach other people and the pupils how to make use of their used water in secondary systems (eg. watering public-green or other plants). Cultivation of useful plants - Management of cultivated areas / useful plants, - Use and application of drip irrigation, - Water cycle by means of treatment of gray and dirty water, - Functioning of sewage treatment plants, - Maintenance and maintenance of sewage treatment plants.

A system had to be established first, to collect that water from households manually as no other drainage-system had currently been available. Costs were covered by the State of Northrhine-Westphalia (NRW) through Engagement Global gGmbH, co-financed by the WBH (only the proportion of the share of NRW is recorded here). Based on that knowledge and the existing plant for demonstration-purposes located in the Capital of Burkina Faso, the WBH was asked for assistance in building and maintaining such purification-plants on the premises of two schools in rural areas.
