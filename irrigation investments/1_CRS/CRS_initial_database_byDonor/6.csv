The project aims to respond to the aforementioned problems by improving the production techniques of small farmers and developing the agro-industrial chain, mainly the sale and diffusion of innovative production factors and the transformation of fruit and vegetables and their marketing. The logic is that the greater fruit and vegetable production generated by better and innovative techniques contributes to the achievement of food security for producers dedicated to self-consumption, while it constitutes an increase in income for those dedicated to their marketing. The latter will be able to sell products to companies that are able to transform and market them. The increase in production will be achieved through training initiatives on agricultural techniques, which will involve 1,200 small producers, use and production of better seeds and the adoption of innovations in the agricultural field such as: management between smaller producers of integrated systems of wells/solar panels/pumps and drip irrigation and/or adoption of Agritube systems that allow a higher production yield with considerable water saving. The project aims to install 6 integrated systems in community lands of 6 villages and 18 Agritube systems (3 for each village). These actions will mainly serve to show small producers their functioning and yield. Their dissemination will be promoted through a revolving fund managed by project partners and from which small producers can draw from to in order  to finance the necessary production improvements. At least 300 small producers are expected to access the revolving fund for this purpose. To develop the agro-industrial chain, the project will work closely with the Ker Moussa network of women producers and transformers consisting of 65 women. For the development of the agro-industrial chain it is planned to develop the following companies: a company that processes fruit, vegetables and cereals, a company that produces and installs the Agritube systems and a company that deals with installing integrated systems of pumps/solar panels/drip irrigation. In the same way as for innovations in the agricultural field, the constitution of companies will be financed with the revolving fund in a logic of ownership and take over by the beneficiaries.",011894/01/3,Senegal,2019,966707,"USD, constant 2021",2019,1,269,10003,South of Sahara,10016,LDCs,11,ODA Grants,1,10,110,C01,.53742498,.53742498,,.580024,.580024,,,,.53742498,,,.580024,,,,,,,918,.48008201,.48008201,.48008201,.53742498,SOCIAL BUSINESS INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGROINDUSTRIAL VALUE CHAIN IN THE THIÈS REGION (SB-AGROIN),31165,Agricultural alternative development,311,III.1.a.

The project aims to respond to the aforementioned problems by improving the production techniques of small farmers and developing the agro-industrial chain, mainly the sale and diffusion of innovative production factors and the transformation of fruit and vegetables and their marketing. The logic is that the greater fruit and vegetable production generated by better and innovative techniques contributes to the achievement of food security for producers dedicated to self-consumption, while it constitutes an increase in income for those dedicated to their marketing. The latter will be able to sell products to companies that are able to transform and market them. The increase in production will be achieved through training initiatives on agricultural techniques, which will involve 1,200 small producers, use and production of better seeds and the adoption of innovations in the agricultural field such as: management between smaller producers of integrated systems of wells/solar panels/pumps and drip irrigation and/or adoption of Agritube systems that allow a higher production yield with considerable water saving. The project aims to install 6 integrated systems in community lands of 6 villages and 18 Agritube systems (3 for each village). These actions will mainly serve to show small producers their functioning and yield. Their dissemination will be promoted through a revolving fund managed by project partners and from which small producers can draw from to in order  to finance the necessary production improvements. At least 300 small producers are expected to access the revolving fund for this purpose. To develop the agro-industrial chain, the project will work closely with the Ker Moussa network of women producers and transformers consisting of 65 women. For the development of the agro-industrial chain it is planned to develop the following companies: a company that processes fruit, vegetables and cereals, a company that produces and installs the Agritube systems and a company that deals with installing integrated systems of pumps/solar panels/drip irrigation. In the same way as for innovations in the agricultural field, the constitution of companies will be financed with the revolving fund in a logic of ownership and take over by the beneficiaries.",2.3,,1,1,0,2,0,,,0,,,,,1,1,1,1,2019-08-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2019 data,30498979840,0,1,0,0,1,1,.580024,898283072,1

The project aims to ensure access to agricultural activities, community education and the creation of income-generating activities. a) Access to agricultural activities: bring the population of the two target villages in the conditions of being able to fully exploit the territory available on site.
