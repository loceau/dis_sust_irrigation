It is the burial place of Amenemhat III, the last great king of the 12th dynasty (about 1855-1808 BC). To the south of the pyramid the Pharaoh constructed a large cult complex (approximately 120 metres by 300 metres), in which the Pharaoh was worshipped as a god for over 1500 years. The huge mortuary temple that originally stood adjacent to this pyramid is believed to have formed the basis of the complex of buildings with galleries and courtyards called a 'labyrinth' by Herodotus. In Late Antiquity, the complex was considered as one of the wonders of the world. Despite its historical significance, there have never been clear drawings or details of the labyrinth layout or structure.   Due to sustained irrigation water flow under the pyramid and labyrinth site, the archaeological site has become abandoned and is exhibiting signs of severe deterioration. This water flow has developed over the past century with the water level now approximately 5 meters below the topographic surface, and about 7 meters above the lower corridor level. There is an international effort to implement a sustainable conservation strategy and dewatering of the site. It is imperative to understand the level of underground water table, using remote sensing to record water levels and thermal conditions of the acquifer material and hydraulic properties within the chambers and in the Pyramid substructure. There is an urgent need to document and diagnose existing condition and use the latest Virtual Heritage Technologies to produce scenario conservation and recovery models, before any conservation or dewatering work can commence.     This 36-months innovative research project offers a breakthrough in the development of state-of-the-art virtual reality interface and repository platform that not only records and documents existing site conditions for interactive visualisation, but more importantly will incorporate structural, thermal and water data within the computerised virtual environment. The outcome of this typological model will feed into the assessement of different scenarios of conservation activities and its potential impact, in advance of implementation. The project team will undertake comprehensive investigative research, and analysis  of the site's archaeological records using innovative virtual heritage technologies that will: a) conduct accurate 3D Cloud-point to laser scan and digitally survey, record and model existing conditions of the site, b) utilise state-of-the-art geophysics underground surveys to detect, analyse and model the labyrinth's spatial layout and its water table, c) develop a state-of-the-art interactive virtual platform that integrates remote sending indicators and dataset, d) develop virtual reality experience of the site, as well as mobile app for the site's history and navigation.

The amount of untreated or partially treated pollutants that enter the water supply is about 4.5 million tons/year. Around 38 million Egyptians drink polluted water and farmlands are irrigated with polluted water, causing the spread of many diseases like cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. Every year more than 100,000 people are diagnosed with cancer, kidney failure along with other diseases due to water pollution. This project aims to develop a novel, low cost, decentralized, solar driven wastewater treatment technology using double distilled Adsorption Water Treatment (AWT) system integrated with nanomaterial pre-treatment unit and novel fluorescence based sensor for real time monitoring of water quality through the followings: 1- Develop advanced Metal Organic Framework (MOF) micro-porous composite materials with superior water adsorption uptake, 2- Develop fluorescence based water quality sensors and integrate these with AWT for continuous monitoring. 3- Develop a pre-treatment unit using naturally available nanomaterials. 4- Develop efficient solar photovoltaic / thermal system to power AWT continuously, 5- Construct a full pilot plant (250 Litres/day) and carry out performance testing. The widespread implementation of this technology will yield socio-economics benefits for millions of Egyptians by reducing illnesses caused by polluted water. There are 124 wastewater discharge point sources on the Nile River from Aswan to Delta Barrage of which 92 use no treatment. In the short/medium term, it is expected to install AWT units to treat at least 30% of the 92 wastewater discharge points thus improving the water quality.

This project aims to develop a novel, low cost, decentralized, solar driven wastewater treatment technology using double distilled Adsorption Water Treatment (AWT) system integrated with nanomaterial pre-treatment unit and novel fluorescence based sensor for real time monitoring of water quality through the followings: 1- Develop advanced Metal Organic Framework (MOF) micro-porous composite materials with superior water adsorption uptake, 2- Develop fluorescence based water quality sensors and integrate these with AWT for continuous monitoring. 3- Develop a pre-treatment unit using naturally available nanomaterials. 4- Develop efficient solar photovoltaic / thermal system to power AWT continuously, 5- Construct a full pilot plant (250 Litres/day) and carry out performance testing. The widespread implementation of this technology will yield socio-economics benefits for millions of Egyptians by reducing illnesses caused by polluted water. There are 124 wastewater discharge point sources on the Nile River from Aswan to Delta Barrage of which 92 use no treatment. In the short/medium term, it is expected to install AWT units to treat at least 30% of the 92 wastewater discharge points thus improving the water quality. Embedding the water quality sensor in schools, factories and village communities will revolutionize the water quality monitoring process by allowing people to instantly measure their water quality thus reducing illnesses caused by polluted water.",9.5,,0,1,0,,,0,0,0,1,,,,0,1,1,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2021 data,108358107136,0,1,0,0,1,1,.0056429999,2547335936,0

It is of a particular concern in Egypt where the hot climate, high solar radiation and lack of water resources for irrigation continue to pose an obstacle to increasing the amount of farmland, and make growing any crops an expensive and resource-intensive endeavour. Agriculture greenhouses (GHs) have been introduced to collect solar energy for maximum crop productivity and quality.

Today, the agri-systems of the southern Ethiopian highlands successfully support one of the highest rural population densities in Africa (up to 1000persons/sqkm). Here, we investigate the landscape scale dynamics, interactions and resilience of these agri-systems, using interdisciplinary environmental modelling, crop genomics and natural capital approaches to understand how best to manage their response to climate change whilst continuing to provide food security for a growing Ethiopian population - predicted to reach 172 million by 2050. Ethiopia is an important center of diversity for food crops, with an agricultural history defined by the domestication of numerous species including coffee, tef and enset. Southern Ethiopian agri-systems include more than 78 cultivated species encompassing roots, tubers, cereals, vegetables, fruits and pulses, including a very high proportion of indigenous crops. Typical farms average 19 different crop and livestock species underpinned by over 120 species of useful trees and shrubs co-occuring across the homegarden landscape. Research on individual crop species also indicates extremely high diversity, for example we have recorded >600 enset varieties, including up to 24 on a single farm, and 37 varieties of yam. This diversity aggregated at multiple scales may be the key to the past resilience of the southern Ethiopian highlands in times of famine, and the source of future resilience to climate change.  Aims: Building on previous research, we hypothesize that the biotic drivers of high agri-system productivity and resilience are: (1) cultivation of a high crop diversity within farms, (2) cultivation of high genetic diversity within crop species and (3) cultivation practices that commonly involve diverse mixes of annual and perennial, indigenous and alien, semi-domesticated and domesticated crops.

Research by Ethiopian partners in this project shows that the provision of small, solar-powered water pumps to irrigate vegetables and cash crops is a highly effective means of increasing resilience to climate-induced stresses and shocks, enhancing household food security, producing of cash crops, reducing women's labour, and  ultimately enabling escape from the poverty cycle. Unfortunately, such irrigation systems are presently beyond the means of most farmers.  We propose to drop the cost of solar irrigation systems to a level affordable for Ethiopian small-holder farmers by: (i) advancing the science required to increase the performance and stability potential of halide perovskite photovoltaics (PV) cells, (ii) customizing the engineering required by significantly enhancing the efficiency of power electronic motor drive for pumps to the precise requirements of Ethiopian smallholders, and (iii) taking an Inclusive Innovation approach to co-designing the whole system with end-users to ensure that it is locally-appropriate and effectively reduces women's work.  We propose that the lead halide perovskites constitute an ideal emerging solar power technology to enable inclusive manufacture in Ethiopia of community-level solar powered irrigation systems because these materials can be printed at relatively low-cost on lightweight, flexible substrates. Here, we focus on solving critical interface loss and stability issues in perovskite solar cells that currently inhibit their commercial deployment. Concomitant with this, we will enhance the engineering of the irrigation system by developing modular and scalable solar inverters using advanced power electronic technologies and precisely designing the pump for small farms with shallow water tables. The solar powered irrigation system will be deployed in Ethiopia to ensure socio-economic and environmental appropriateness and provide a platform for scaled local engineering of the systems.  This proposal represents an innovative and unique programme of leading-edge experimental science and systems engineering studies, which are of direct relevance to enhancing economic development and welfare in Ethiopia. The interdisciplinary project will explore some of the central structure-composition-property issues of halide perovskite interfaces and their integration into systems, which brings together the complementary expertise of the applicants and will exploit techniques in which the UK is internationally competitive and in many aspects internationally leading.

Today, the agri-systems of the southern Ethiopian highlands successfully support one of the highest rural population densities in Africa (up to 1000persons/sqkm). Here, we investigate the landscape scale dynamics, interactions and resilience of these agri-systems, using interdisciplinary environmental modelling, crop genomics and natural capital approaches to understand how best to manage their response to climate change whilst continuing to provide food security for a growing Ethiopian population - predicted to reach 172 million by 2050. Ethiopia is an important center of diversity for food crops, with an agricultural history defined by the domestication of numerous species including coffee, tef and enset. Southern Ethiopian agri-systems include more than 78 cultivated species encompassing roots, tubers, cereals, vegetables, fruits and pulses, including a very high proportion of indigenous crops. Typical farms average 19 different crop and livestock species underpinned by over 120 species of useful trees and shrubs co-occuring across the homegarden landscape. Research on individual crop species also indicates extremely high diversity, for example we have recorded >600 enset varieties, including up to 24 on a single farm, and 37 varieties of yam. This diversity aggregated at multiple scales may be the key to the past resilience of the southern Ethiopian highlands in times of famine, and the source of future resilience to climate change.  Aims: Building on previous research, we hypothesize that the biotic drivers of high agri-system productivity and resilience are: (1) cultivation of a high crop diversity within farms, (2) cultivation of high genetic diversity within crop species and (3) cultivation practices that commonly involve diverse mixes of annual and perennial, indigenous and alien, semi-domesticated and domesticated crops. This rich diversity at multiple scales can in principle support food security and sustainable intensification whilst buffering seasonal food deficits, emerging pests and diseases and facilitating agronomic adaptation, despite an average farm size of only 0.9 hectares and very few off-farm inputs such as irrigation systems and fertilizers.  In contrast to this indigenous diversity, farmers also grow highly domesticated introduced crops such as maize, avocado and banana, providing an ideal opportunity to evaluate these hypotheses. These crops are high yielding but likely to contain less genetic diversity. This may limit their capacity for adaptation to new or altered environments and their resilience to climate change.

In times of weather extremes causing crop losses, grass pea often remains one of the most available foods and the cheapest source of protein, helping people survive during food shortages. The mounting challenge of climate change increases the need for crops that can be grown sustainably and withstand weather extremes. Through its 8000-year history of cultivation grass pea has been a part of human diets - from Neolithic sites in the Balkans, through the bronze-age middle east, the Roman Empire and medieval Europe until the modern day. But despite its value for food and nutritional security, grass pea carries the stigma of a potentially dangerous food. Its seeds and leaves contain a neurotoxic compound that can cause a debilitating disease known as neurolathyrism. This disease only appears in people who are malnourished and consume large amounts of grass pea over several months. Yet the fear of neurolathyrism, which has been known since antiquity, has led to grass pea being undervalued by farmers, breeders and scientists, making it an 'orphan crop'. There is no significant international trade in grass pea and too little research to develop the potential of this resilient, sustainable source of protein. Grass pea is able to fix nitrogen from the air (through symbiosis with nodulating bacteria), can efficiently use soil phosphate through its mycorrhizal associations, can penetrate into hard, heavy soil and is relatively tolerant to pests and diseases. All these characteristics make it an ideal crop for agriculture where farming inputs (fertiliser, pesticides, irrigation, etc.) are limited, as is the case in most smallholder farms in Sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore believe that improved grass pea varieties can have a significant impact beyond the millions of people who already cultivate it in Africa today and could become a crucial sustainable food source for many more.  Our project aims to remove the limitations of this crop by using the tools and resources we have already developed in our previous research to breed new varieties that are safe to consume, high-yielding, nutritious and resilient to environmental stress. We have identified new low-toxin variants with lower beta-ODAP contents than any existing varieties. In addition we have sequenced and assembled  the grass pea genome and transcriptomes under stress and non-stress conditions and we are working to enable modern crop improvement methods on the back of these. Through this research partnership we have access to grass pea lines representing the global diversity of the crop and those that are locally adapted to East Africa and to expertise on smallholder agriculture and seed systems.

Long: With an ever-increasing world population, fertilizers have become indispensable for higher yields in agricultural food production and especially application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. However, N fertilizer use also leads to emissions of reactive N in the form of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrates (NO3-), these are altering the N cycle and contributing to climate change. Loss of NH3 not only reduces the N-use efficiency but is also an indirect source of N2O emission. Ammonium (NH4+) aerosols contribute to fine particulate matter and regional pollution in the atmosphere leading to a deterioration in air quality. Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas responsible for global warming and climate change. Common countermeasures against the environmental impact of N from fertilizer N include the use of enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs). Of these, nitrification inhibitors (neem oil coated urea, karanj oil coated urea), controlled release fertilizer (sulfur coated urea and phosphogypsum coated urea) and urease inhibitors (limus coated urea) may hold promise for suppression of soil nitrification, conservation of soil N and improved N status through development of low NO3- concentrations in ecosystems. These treatments are therefore used in the PhD work. Nitrfication inhibitors temporarily suppress the microbial conversion of NH4+ to nitrite (NO2-) in the soil. This reduces substrate availability for NO3- formation and subsequent denitrification, thereby decreasing N2O emission and NO3- leaching. Although this prolongs the retention of NH4+ in the soil, it could potentially increase NH3 emissions and contribute indirectly to N2O emission through subsequent nitrification and denitrification. Rice is one of the major crops grown widely in India and NIs may not be so efficient at reducing N2O emission from flooded rice paddy fields as submergence of the field makes the soil system anaerobic, it naturally suppresses the nitrification process. Understanding the action of nitrification inhibitors in rice paddy fields has been identified as a research gap, previous studies with irrigated rice have neglected the influences of the various inhibitors on both N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization. Data collected during this PhD have provided a comprehensive study of the such emissions in the Indian scenario, these can be analysed and compared with the methods used in University of Aberdeen. After the parameterisation and evaluation of the ORATOR model (Operational Research Assessment Tool for Organic Resources) using data from my PhD, simulations will be scaled up to estimate the impacts of using modified fertilizers across different regions in India. This will be further used to estimate the amount N2O and NH3 volatilization losses that can be reduced while increasing the N use efficiency across India.

Yields (tonnes per hectare) of wheat are variable, depending on local climate and the availability of resources such as water. Due to factors such as an increasing human population and pressures on land use there is a need to continually improve the 'genetic yield' of wheat. However the annual yield gains are increasingly threatened by the double impact of rising atmospheric temperatures and lowered water availability caused by climate change. Vulnerable wheat producing regions, including Mexico, face lowered productivity and economic difficulties if wheat yields decline or fail as a result of adverse temperatures and/or water availability. Therefore generating wheat lines with increased water use efficiency and high temperature tolerance is critically important.   This project proposal aims to generate novel genetic and physiological information that is necessary to improve water use efficiency and heat tolerance of wheat in NW Mexico. High temperature and water availability have a clear negative relationship. Temperature is also a regulator of plant and crop processes, being central to the regulation of development. High temperatures can be a major source of stress, affecting photosynthesis, respiration, photorespiration and the generation of active oxygen.   Water is important for wheat yields in Mexico with up to 84 % of wheat in this country requiring irrigation. There is also strong evidence that the mean temperatures in NW Mexico are rapidly rising. However it is becoming clear that the minimum (NIGHT TIME) temperatures are contributing to yield decline in cereals. Despite this, most work has focussed on the effect of day time temperatures while very little is known about nocturnal traits and their genetic regulation. Here we focus on the puzzle of night time water loss and its relationship with increasing night time temperatures: it is known that wheat leaves can lose a substantial amount of water at night via transpiration (even under drought) and there is genetic variation for this trait. This project will overcome this knowledge gap by producing novel techniques for night time screening of promising wheat germplasm for night time transpiration. We will apply methods for manipulating nocturnal temperatures of experimental crops in the field in the Sonoran region. This project will bring together expert groups: the University of Nottingham (UK) which has expertise in photosynthetic and root phenotyping of wheat crops, Instituto Tecnológico de Sonora with expertise in water and environmental science, The Earlham Institute (UK) for wheat genomic analysis.

Further, hydropower plants driven by glacial meltwater provide more than 40% of Peru's electricity. However, Peru's glaciers are receding rapidly, threatening this supply, as well as releasing sediment to valley areas and revealing topographic depressions that may become natural reservoirs for glacier runoff. These thawing landscapes are also very active and can pose risks to downstream people and infrastructure. PEGASUS will assess the opportunities and threats that rapidly evolving landscapes, and natural resources, will bring to the people and businesses of three glacierised Cordilleras of the Peruvian Andes - Urubamba, Vilcabamba and Vilcanota - and make recommendations that will maximise the potential prosperity that can be gained in the face of continued environmental change.   Modelling the climate of mountain catchments such as those in Peru is complex because of the interaction of large-scale weather systems with local-scale winds and extreme relief. Uncertainties in modelling the climate feed into projections of glacier change, which themselves are limited by a lack of data on previous glacier behaviour for calibration, and downstream river flows for validation. Robust climate modelling is also required for predictions of permafrost (freezing) heights, which are a key control on ice and bedrock stability, and thus avalanche risk. PEGASUS will produce new and refined projections of climate that will drive cutting edge glacier and permafrost models, to yield firm predictions of how the glaciers and freezing levels will change on a 5-yearly interval from now until the end of the century.  As the glaciers recede and hillslopes become more active, sediment will be released into the valleys, and lakes will develop where ice existed. Some of the sediment will be trapped within these glacial lakes, and some will be transferred downstream by river flows. The rate of sediment release by glaciers in advanced states of recession is poorly known, and the role of lakes in capturing the sediment is also poorly quantified. PEGASUS will perform field measurements and modelling to improve understanding of the role of glacial lakes in removing, conveying and storing sediment being released from the glaciers, and characterise the impact this will have on downstream water quality and critical hydropower infrastructure.  The locations of future glacial lakes can be predicted by modelling the thickness of the current glaciers and identifying subglacial depressions that will be revealed as the ice recedes.

Food shortages and poor nutrition affect many households, with 24% of under-fives stunted. Poor nutrition is not just a lack of macronutrients but of micronutrients, minerals and vitamins which have an impact on health. 17% of children and 19% of pregnant women in South Africa are deficient in vitamin A. The smallholder sector comprises approx. 2 million farms most of which are on land with degraded soil and low rainfall, these areas have the highest prevalence of poverty and food and nutrition problems. Productivity is low. Most areas in South Africa are prone to drought and 8 out of 9 provinces have received progressively less rainfall since 1970. Inadequate rainfall causes reduced yields, especially in the smallholder farming sector where farmers cannot afford irrigation. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to ensure sufficient nutritional food and a source of income for these farmers and their households in a sustainable manner, i.e. produced in a way that is resilient to environmental fluctuation and does not deplete natural resources.  Although neglected and underutilised, African leafy vegetables (ALVs) offer unique opportunities to diversify farming systems, contribute to climate change adaptation, ensure food security, alleviate poverty, increase income and improve human health (particularly malnutrition and lack of micronutrients). Most communities affected by poverty and undernutrition live in areas rich in biodiversity, including ALVs. A key attribute of ALVs is their high nutritional content with many studies indicating higher levels of vitamins and minerals compared to cultivated vegetables, such as cabbage and spinach. The consumption of ALVs is in decline in many rural communities which has contributed to poor diets and increased incidence of nutritional deficiencies. Currently, ALVs are harvested from the wild rather than cultivated. This is unsustainable and already a decline in the wild population of ALVs has been reported due to over-harvesting and lack of seed production.  ALVs are well-adapted to local growing conditions. ALVs grow on marginal land with little input. They are hardy and able to thrive in both drought and flood times. As a result ALVs are available during harsh environmental conditions when most cultivated crops would have failed, and indeed harvesting and consumption of ALVs from the wild increases in rural regions during times of drought to help meet food shortages.
