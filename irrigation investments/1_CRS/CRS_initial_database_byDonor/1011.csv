With support from ADB and the World Bank Group, the Government of Cambodia (the Government) prepared the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), comprising seven investment projects and the proposed technical assistance (TA). The resource envelope for SPCR is $385 million including $86 million from PPCR and $299 million in co-financing from ADB and other development partners. The PPCR sub-committee endorsed SPCR in June 2011. The TA will promote synergies between CCA and disatser risk reduction, sets up a common framework for monitoring and evaluation of all SPCR projects, and develops a knowledge and communications plan for each component that will be critical to sustaining the impact and effectiveness of current and future climate resilience investments. The TA will (i) strengthen capacity to coordinate all SPCR investments and to mainstream adaptation concerns into national and sub-national planning, budgeting and development in Cambodia, (ii) conduct feasibility studies for priority projects of the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) with a view to secure additional funds from sources such as Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund, (iii) establish a civil society support mechanism to fund community-based adaptation activities and strengthen capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to mainstream climate resilience into their operations, and (iv) generate and disseminate knowledge for climate change adaptation (CCA) in various sectors. The expected impact of the TA is enhanced resilience to climate change in Cambodia leading to improved livelihoods, especially for vulnerable groups including women and children. By 2022, the number of households affected and economic losses resulting from extreme climate events will be reduced by 20% from the 2012 baseline.
