In the first instance, the Project aims to respond in the short-term to the critical problem of unemployment in the target rural areas through direct employment creation, using labor-intensive civil works for natural resource management emphasizing soil erosion control. The longer-term perspective emphasizes the instrument of asset creation for stimulating employment, mainly through natural resource management, protection of the environment, water resource mobilization, and income-generating rural development activities aiming at the substitution of perennial tree crops in place of annual cereal production, with the purpose of increasing labor productivity in a sustainable manner. There are five project components. The specific activities of Component 1, soil erosion control, comprise the following: reforestation targeting degraded mountainous areas, river bank protection entailing the biological stabilization of river banks, terracing and biological control entailing the building or the rehabilitation of terraces on steep slopes susceptible to serious erosion, plant material production, flood control structures, forest rehabilitation, and silvicultural activities, which aim at cleaning up degraded forest areas with plants that are old, dead or suffering from pests. Component 2 aims to diversify the production base by expanding the limited tree fruit production in the project area. Specific activities call for fruit tree plantations, windbreaks, vineyards, land clearing, upgrading and rehabilitating rural roads, commercial production of small livestock, and artisanal activities targeting rural women. Component 3 focuses on resource mobilization. Component 4 covers support for the Central project management unit (CCGW) and the Wilaya level PMU (CCGW), including training.

This component focuses on improving the irrigation service delivery in the NSS through the rehabilitation and modernization of the scheme's infrastructure, effective participation of Water User Organization (WUO), increased cost recovery, ensuring full provision of operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, improved delivery of irrigation water to WUOs at all levels as per their share determined by the Andhra Pradesh Water Resources Regulatory Commission (APWRRC), and implementation of improved water management practices and instruments. The second component of the project is irrigated agriculture intensification and diversification. This component aims at increasing farmer incomes in the NSS by improving productivity, diversification, and profitability of field and horticultural crops, livestock, fisheries, and other production activities. This will be achieved by adoption of improved production technologies and efficient on-farm water management practices, strengthening of agriculture support services, and by making agricultural production more demand-driven and better aligned with the emerging market opportunities. Expected results from this component are: (i) increased cropping intensity, (ii) increased crop diversity, and (iii) increased productivity of field and vegetable crops, livestock, and fish. The third component of the project is water sector institutional restructuring and capacity building. This component will focus on institutional reform and capacity building in the water sector institutions to strengthen the state's capacity for multi-sectoral planning, development, and management of water resources.

The project will provide a grant to each of 2,600 of the poorest villagers on Java and Sumatra for building local infrastructures. The villagers will decide what to build, from a menu of choices, and will build it by themselves, the workers being paid by output. Much of the grant may be used to purchase materials. Some equipment will be leased. Field engineers will assist the villagers to plan and implement the works, while also handling financial aspects. Senior engineers and a project management unit will be in charge of the overall planning, coordination and implementation management.",,,,,1,2,,,,,,,1,,,,,,2009-07-06,5,2,2590,,2009-12-15,2016-12-15,.071786001,,,,,,,,,CRS 2009 data,141077938176,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,3339995136,1

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is improving the irrigation water service. This component aims at providing participating farmers with irrigation service necessary for high efficiency drip irrigation. This will be achieved through: (i) replacing irrigation canals with pressurized systems or adapting existing pressurized systems, and (ii) providing irrigation water on-demand, with a predetermined annual quota according to surface water availability. The component activities will include: detailed studies including topographic works and laboratory tests, technical assistance for works monitoring and control, adapting regulation of main adduction channels including changing hydro-mechanic systems, construction of distribution pipes, including installation of hydraulic equipment, construction or adaptation of pumping stations and various civil works. This component also includes the preparation and signature of water supply contracts between ORMVAs (office regional de mise en valeur Agricole - regional agricultural development office) and farmers. The second component of the project is supporting farmers and their partners. This component aims to improve targeted farmers' access to technology, financing, and agricultural markets. This will be achieved through: (i) provision of technical assistance to ORMVAs to support the farmers and agro processors to develop and enter into partnership agreements aiming at securing markets for high value crops, (ii) provision of technical assistance and equipment to ORMVAs to help for the implementation of the market information system, (iii) provision of technical assistance to the ORMVAs to help farmers to use the new irrigation equipment and to improve their agricultural practices, and (iv) provision of mobile laboratory equipment to ORMVAs to monitor performance of new irrigation systems. The third component of the project is assisting implementing agencies in project management and monitoring. This component aims at building capacities of the Borrower and project implementing agencies to enable them ensuring a good management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project activities and results in compliance with procedures that will be agreed with the Bank. This component activities mainly include: (i) provision of training, technical assistance and computer equipment to MAPM (ministere de l'agriculture et de la peche maritime - ministry of agriculture and marine fisheries) for designing and implementing technical and management tools to be used by ORMVAs, (ii) provision of training and technical assistance to ORMVAs, for improving Project management tools, Project monitoring and eva",P093719.IBRD78750.crs1,Morocco,2010,1497708,"USD, constant 2021",2010,3,136,10002,North of Sahara,10018,LMICs,14,Other Official Flows (non Export Credit),4,21,421,,1.4,.003305,0,1.497708,.0035359999,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,302,1.4,.003305,,,MA-MODERNIZATION OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN THE OUM ER RBIA BASIN,22040,Information and communication technology (ICT),220,II.2.

Likewise, the global environment objective seeks to promote increased understanding on the role of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and the potential impact of various land use practices upon biodiversity, and their economic and ecological sustainability. Through the Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management Component, demand-driven activities will be financed to promote sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity. This will be accomplished through financial and technical assistance towards improving natural resources management practices in livestock production systems, with special reference to improved management of natural pastures and biodiversity. The component will further adopt improved practices in dryland agriculture, for natural resources management systems in irrigated areas, and, in biodiversity conservation. The second component, fully financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources, will establish demonstration areas within the selected areas of GEF-interventions (grasslands and serranias), for a sustainable use of natural resources in key micro-catchments which are of importance for biodiversity, combining sound practices for natural resources management, and creating increased public awareness on the significance, and socioeconomic importance of biodiversity.
