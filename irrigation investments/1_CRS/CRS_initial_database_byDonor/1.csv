The father of two project members provided a plot of land of about 4 ha, which was leased by the newly founded association notre terre for 99 years.  The overall project notre terre (translated our earth) mainly includes the cultivation of Artemisia annua for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria and other local diseases. For this purpose, a well has already been drilled (mainly  with the project manager's own funds, some donations, but also with financial support from ADA), a water elevated tank has been set up, a residential building and a storage building have been built. Small-scale cultivation of Artemisia annua  began as early as 2021 in order to learn about the plant's growth, maturation period, and water requirements in this region. The planned large-scale, year-round cultivation of Artemisia annua on about 3 ha in this region can only be managed  in the long term with a good irrigation system. At best, about 30,000 plants can be harvested annually on this area. This can contribute enormously to the treatment of malaria in this region, considering that the tea from the leaves of one  well-grown plant can help up to 8 adult people (and about twice as many children) to cure malaria. The current core project includes an irrigation system, along the lines of drip irrigation, but with one controller and more water per plant  (pure drip irrigation would not be sufficient) and a solar power system (incl. inverter and batteries for solar power storage and use in the buildings).  Solar panels were thankfully provided by the company Sonnenkraft. The well's flow rate  of 9 m³/h and the reservoir of the elevated tank are sufficient for irrigation.

In a developing country like Nepal, the intensity of natural disasters are even more due to weakly monitored infrastructure  development activities such as constructions of roads, buildings irrigation channels, telecommunication towers, hydropower projects etc. Almost every family living on hills and mountains is vulnerable to landslide, flood, debris flow and  earthquake induced landslides disasters. Due to increasing number of landslides incidents every year, it has become routine or customary to bear the loss of hundreds of lives and property worth millions of dollars due to landslides and  floods. In order to mitigate the human induced and rainfall triggered natural disasters, it is necessary to implement appropriate preventive and curative measures against slope failure, soil erosion and flooding. Soil nailing is an economical  and efficient reinforcement technique used as a remedial measure in unstable natural slopes or as retraining structure for excavated slopes. In comparison with other retaining protection structures, soil nailing permits to reduce the  excavated fill soil volume, saving construction materials and realization time. There are basically two concerns about the application of soil nailing, first is in its analysis and design and second is about the use of materials. In order to  make an innovative construction practice and to make it more cost effective, environment friendly and sustainable, a right choice of facing and an appropriate design of soil nails are very important. Regarding the analysis and design of soil  nails, several national codes or guidelines exist. But the role of facing elements in controlling the deformation of excavated front or the overall stability of slope is not yet completely understood (Sanvitale et al, 2013).The stiffness of  facing strongly influences the characteristics of tensile force distribution, such as for a slope of two lateral segments, the tensile force at the connection (nail head) of nail with facing, and the location of maximum traction on the  soil-nail-facing system. (Sanvitale et al, 2013). Most of the conventional soil nailing with shotcrete, precast concrete or metal facing elements are generally costly and do not offer a 'Green' slope. The flexible facing elements do offer  some possibilities to grow some plants on the slope but have some disadvantages e.g. bulging or punching at nail heads and are not suitable to control surface erosion and local shear failure. In the above context, the soil nailing system with  semi-flexible 3-dimensional galvanized steel mat (popular as KRISMER® system in Europe) is a high-quality construction system which has proved itself one of the best solutions to stabilize slopes and embankments.
