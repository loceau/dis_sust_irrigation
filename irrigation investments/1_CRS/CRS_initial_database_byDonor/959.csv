The basin is of critical economic importance: it is the source of over 98% of the country?s power generating capacity, supplies water to major urban centres such as Blantyre and Limbe, supports a locally significant artisanal fishery, and supplies irrigation water for valuable crops. B.Malawi?s economy is based primarily on agriculture, dominated by subsistence and rainfed food production systems that are greatly challenged by land degradation and declining soil fertility. More than 90% of the people in the rural area comprises of resource-poor communities who predominantly engage in subsistence agriculture. Currently about 60% of the households in rural areas are food insecure for most of the year. Extensive land use including extensive tree felling in the Middle and Upper Shire have resulted in severe deforestation, land degradation and soil erosion, losing 13 percent of the total forest cover between 1990 and 2005 and 35 of the primary forest cover in the period 2000 ? 2005. In addition, the country lost an estimated 13 tons of soil per hectare per year from the Upper Shire River, 29 tons/ha in Middle Shire and 17 tons/ha per year in the Lower Shire River basin. By 2003, the loss equated to 9.5-11% of annual gross domestic product (AGDP). The soil erosion has led to food shortages and siltation of the Shire River and its tributaries with serious negative effects on flooding, hydro-electric power generation, water purification, human health and fisheries. Data from the Southern Regional Water Board and ESCOM shows significant increase in cost of cleaning water and generating electricity. Frequent electricity outages add to the cost by rendering people unproductive and destroying electrical equipment. C.The dramatic land degradation in the Shire basin has been driven by poor agricultural practices and deforestation. These are in turn driven by the negative interrelationship of high dependence on natural resources coupled with poor resource management, poverty, rapid population growth, ineffective policy implementation, and poor economic development, and more recently, climate change. There are three key barriers to the adoption of sustainable land management systems in the Shire River Basin: weaknesses in the policy, planning and institutional environment that influence SLM, weak financial incentives for adoption of SLM, weak capacities and inadequate skills at all levels required for promoting and/or adopting SLM.: D.The overall goal of the project is: ?Sustainable Land Management? provides the basis for economic development, food security and sustainable livelihoods while restoring the ecological integrity of the River shire Basin?.
