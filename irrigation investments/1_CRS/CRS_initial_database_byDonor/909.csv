The GoJ¿s policy is to promote the formation and functioning of Water User Associations (WUAs) as legal entities with farmers as members and shareholders who will have the power to govern these organizations. Responsibility for local management of water distribution, monitoring and system maintenance will be assumed eventually by the WUAs. The IDB funded projects are currently at a stage where wells are drilled and the beneficiaries are getting ready to commence the production and management of their respective schemes, albeit on a small scale until full transfer is given.The ability to garner knowledge and understanding of irrigation and management practices in the WUA context and the exchange of ideas bring benefits to both the host and visiting institutions, and can develop into working collaborations. It will also aid in building the confidence of the leaders of the WUAs, showing them what is indeed possible, it broadens experience, enhances knowledge, challenges thinking and will be stimulating. The Bank, has financed a program in the Dominican Republic (DR), with similar characteristic of the one financed in Jamaica. In both cases, the Water Users Association in Jamaica and Juntas de Irrigacion in DR, proposes the creation and strengthening of a decentralized mechanism to manage the system as a proved strategy that improves water management governance and sustainability. In the case of DR, this organizations have been playing an important role in water conflict management, are self sustainable and requires non or minimum interventions from the Government.

The GoJ¿s policy is to promote the formation and functioning of Water User Associations (WUAs) as legal entities with farmers as members and shareholders who will have the power to govern these organizations. Responsibility for local management of water distribution, monitoring and system maintenance will be assumed eventually by the WUAs. The IDB funded projects are currently at a stage where wells are drilled and the beneficiaries are getting ready to commence the production and management of their respective schemes, albeit on a small scale until full transfer is given.The ability to garner knowledge and understanding of irrigation and management practices in the WUA context and the exchange of ideas bring benefits to both the host and visiting institutions, and can develop into working collaborations. It will also aid in building the confidence of the leaders of the WUAs, showing them what is indeed possible, it broadens experience, enhances knowledge, challenges thinking and will be stimulating.
