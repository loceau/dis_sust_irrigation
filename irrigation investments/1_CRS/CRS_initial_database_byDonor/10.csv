The main objective of the project is to contribute to food security and poverty reduction through water resources mobilisation and valorisation for agriculture, livestock and fisheries, taking into account climate change. This will be achieved through increased availability of surface water through the building and rehabilitation of small dams, creating conditions that improve adaptation to climate change.In 2012 allegations of mismanagement caused a freeze of project funds, and a temporarily stop to, or at least slow-down of, project activities. Sida/Progsam decided to take up disbursement in December 2013, as additional mismanagement was not seen as a high risk at that stage, and the need to continue project activities was urgent. The issue and the delays have made it necessary to revise work plans/budgets and extend the time-frame of the project, which require an amendment of the agreement.",,,1,1,1,0,0,0,,,,,1,,1,0,2,1,2010-01-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2018 data,29398272000,0,0,0,1,0,1,,625761920,0

This through establishment of income-generating livelihoods specifically for refugee and host societies, decrease cost of humanitarian aid over time and bridging the gap between humanitarian work and development. The goal is to implement this with sustainable and innovative solutions.The innovative in this context is to allow a humanitarian actor such as WFP (World FoodProgram, which has the dual mandate to also work on development), to partner with organizations that specialize in agriculture, livelihoods and market development.A major part of the contribution will target people in refugee camps in the Dollo Ado area in the southern Somali region. This is an area that is currently receiving humanitarian aid, and the goal is to lift the people living there into a situation that enables sustainable development. The contribution will both target refugee and host communities. The Livelihood efforts will focus on access to water and improved agriculture through irrigation. Access to markets and financial tools will be an integral part of the livelihood development.The contribution in Dollo Ado will begin with and inception phase with a thorough feasibility study of livelihood options, an assessment of environmental impact and market analysis.  On top of this resilience will be built by improving early warning and response systems for drought and provide an innovative insurance system that will protect current assets as well as provide reimbursement when assets are lost because of drought.Another part of the contribution aims to strengthen the capacity of public, national and local institutions to better resist recurrent drought and disasters. It is primarily the Ethiopian transport sector that will be strengthened by training of drivers and enhanced capacity whit disaster management.The main Implementation partner is WFP, in collaboration with Farm Africa and Mercy Corps.

The proposed contribution  Local Climate Adaptive Living - LoCAL Mozambique  is a first upscaling phase of the already ongoing pilot project. It aims to reduce the vulnerability of the rural population and improve resilience to climate change at district level through increase in access to climate change adaptation financing through performance-based climate resilient grants (PBCRGs). The main expected results are (in short):1. Effective financing mechanism established and operationalised.2. Climate change mainstreamed in district planning and budgeting.3. Climate Change resilient investments (infrastructure and services)4. Monitoring and evaluation for Learning.5. Preparations for national upscale phase (from 2023 and onwards).The proposed programme will be implemented during 2018-2023 in the districts of Massingir, Guijá, Mabalane och Chicualacuala in the Gaza province (ongoing pilot phase since 2015) with gradual upscaling in these districts and replication in Chigubo, Massangena, Chókwe and Chibuto districts in Gaza and to the districts of Jangamo, Panda, Funhalouro, Govuro and Mabote in the Inhambane province. The selection of districts has been done on the basis of an analysis of vulnerability to climate change, in consultation with concerned stakeholders. The central idea of LoCAL Mozambique is to provide financing as PBCRGs of priority actions identified in the PLAs by local communities, both infrastructure and non-infrastructure, not at household level. Examples of PBCRGs under the ongoing LoCAL pilot phase: Equipment for water supply and irrigation systems, parts of a maternity ward, rainwater harvesting dam for livestock and agriculture, electrical power transformation post (for irrigation scheme), re-roofing of primary schools, and a Resilience techniques training center - Livestock branch. Budgets per project during the 2017/2018 season range between 0,4 Mkr - 1,1 Mkr.Grant allocations are performance-based. A basic formula for dividing available funding between participating districts based on population size and land area is first applied.

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the growth of a sustained market for off-grid renewable energy in Rwanda by 1) supporting private sector to deliver access to modern energy to about 77,500 people in rural areas, in a way that is inclusive of people living in poverty and as a means to drive economic development by creating nearly 7,000 jobs, 2) work towards reducing carbon emissions, thus contributing to better environment, limited climate impacts and greater resilience to environmental impact, and climate change by reducing dependency on unsustainable energy sources that contribute to pollution, and environmental degradation. In relation to the Energy and Farming, introduction of solar powered pumps irrigation systems technology will improve resilience of small farmers to withstand the climate changes in a more climate friendly and cost effective way by allowing farmers to access predictable and adequate water at the place and time when crops need it. Improved resilience to climate change will be ensured through making irrigation systems hydraulic feasible (water availability), well designed (storage capacity, conveyance capacities and control structures) as well as operated (water allocation). The technology will also contribute to protecting the field environment against degradation in the long term and to ensure water and land resources are utilised efficiently and in a sustainable manner. However, the system should be properly designed and managed, because if it is not well managed, the irrigation systems can waste water and energy, deplete or pollute water resources, and fail to produce good crops and cause soil degradation.

The program is nationwide and targets approximately one million households identified as extremely poor. Every two month households receive a fixed cash transfer that is adjusted to the household size. In addition to the fixed contribution, households can also receive an additional transfer that is conditional on children attending school and small children brought on regular visits to primary health care centres. PSSN also includes a public works component. During the agricultural lean season, when it is difficult to find temporary jobs, labour-intensive projects that in various ways contribute to the local communities' development are implemented (e.g. construction of class rooms and dams for irrigation). Only people belonging to the poorest households, i.e. those who are also eligible for the direct cash transfers, are eligible to participate in the public works projects.By design PSSN empowers women. The payment of both cash contributions and compensation for participation in public works are made to an adult woman in the household. Only in households where there is no adult woman the payment can be made to a man. In addition to the direct cash transfers and public works components, PSSN includes a livelihood component to help households develop productive activities in order to eventually be able to graduate from poverty.The contribution consists of three parts.

The second part is the additional financing which in all respects is design as the initial financing with the supplementary feature that the additional is linked to Tanzania's contribution to the program from the national budget. The additional financing will at the most reach the same level per Tanzania financial year as the initial contribution and thereby implies potential doubling of the Swedish contribution. An important goal of the contribution is for PSSN to become sustainable as an integral part of Tanzania's social protection system even after donor funding ceases.
