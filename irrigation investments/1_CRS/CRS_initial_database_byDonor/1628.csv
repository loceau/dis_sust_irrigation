Description: The Research Enrichment activity will involve a participatory health education to increase awareness and encourage good practices related to the prevention and control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in Samia sub-county, Busia County in western Kenya. Activities will be coordinated by the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) in collaboration with local health and education authorities. Activities will start with engaging school teachers, community health volunteers and parents in open space meetings to discuss and explore community perceptions and issues related to vector-borne diseases, and suggestions for improved control. Participants in open space meetings will be purposively selected from communities where the on-going study is implemented. Issues raised in open space discussions will inform development of action plans for the health education targeting children aged 12-15 selected from at least 12 schools from the study area. Practical demonstrations will include the use of traps for vector surveillance, dippers in aquatic habitats and screening for malaria parasites. Initially, children will be taught about biology of common vector-borne diseases, their prevention and control, using fun and interactive approaches. The participatory health education will culminate into World Mosquito Day on Thursday, 20 August 2020, where the children will participate in the dissemination of information related to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases using entertaining techniques. In groups, the children will develop their own relevant disease-themed projects, such as drama, for presentation. This exercise is aimed at encouraging participants to be messengers of good practices to improve control of vector-borne diseases.",204863/Z/16/A,Kenya,2019,17404,"USD, constant 2021",2019,8,248,10003,South of Sahara,10018,LMICs,30,Private Development Finance,6,30,110,C01,.015186,.015186,,.017403999,.017403999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,.0119,.0119,,,UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF NEWLY DEVELOPED IRRIGATION SCHEMES IN WESTERN KENYA IN THE CONTEXT OF MALARIA ELIMINATION,12262,Malaria control,122,I.2.b.

Description: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major public health problem all over the world. Infections caused by AMR microorganisms fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Due to the increased usage of antimicrobials in the human, animal and the environmental sectors globally, AMR is recognised as an OneHealth challenge. Antibiotics are used as growth enhancers, metaphylactics, and prophylactics in human health and animal husbandry, and transmitted in the environment through irrigation using wastewater. Influencing human behaviour on antibiotic usage is a complex process which includes factors like knowledge, attitudes, social norms, socio-economic conditions, peer pressure, experiences, and bio-physical and socio-behavioural environment. In medical practices and farms in high- and middle-income countries, numerous Antibiotic Stewardship policies have been designed and implemented. However, these remain underexplored in lower and middle income countries such as Malaysia. Understanding these aspects on the utilisation of antimicrobial drugs among the different sectors in Southeast Asia is essential to develop and implement policies to halt and curb AMR development and transmission that cut-across all sectors within the OneHealth consortium.
