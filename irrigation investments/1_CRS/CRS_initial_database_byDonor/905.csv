The project components will: 1) support the rehabilitation of critical irrigation structures, by upgrading primary canal structures, and sections in deficient state, but critical for the effective operation of major irrigation water conveyance infrastructure systems. Aqueducts, and often siphon structures will undergo rehabilitation works, while specifically, the Armavir irrigation scheme will be improved, by expanding river intake schemes, the main conveyance canal, and secondary canal, and will include construction of sediment control facilities, 2) support the conversion from pump, to gravity irrigation, to reduce the reliance on high-cost energy-intensive irrigation, for those cases where clear technical, and economic viability can de demonstrated, and, 3) create conditions for effective operations, and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation infrastructure through institutional strengthening, by supporting appropriate institutional reforms. In particular, the Water Supply Agency will be responsible for the O&M of facilities supplying water from major sources, and drainage and irrigation management agencies will be constituted as autonomous regional, or scheme-level O&M enterprises. Additionally, independent consultative, assessment, and liaison contributions to system management will be provided by the Technical Consultative Commission on O&M of the irrigation, and drainage system, and the Irrigation Water Group, this last one to serve as the forum to assist stakeholders with information, conflict resolution, or performance issues.",,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,2007-07-31,,,,,2018-01-15,2027-07-15,.0030410001,,,,,,,,,CRS 2007 data,12472434688,1,1,1,0,1,1,1.5307879,752731264,1

The AgDPO 2 is consistent with the Bank's strategic focus on country systems, and the Government's draft aid policy that seeks a greater share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support.",,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,2010-06-03,,,,,2020-11-15,2045-05-15,.019007999,,,,,,,,,CRS 2010 data,35949277184,0,1,0,0,1,1,6.1513,319319552,1

There are three components to the project, the first component being rehabilitation and improvement of dams and associated appurtenances. This component focuses on structural and non structural measures at 223 project dams, many of which are more than 25 years old. The number of dams proposed for inclusion in the project is based on proposals received from the four participating states. The states have done a review of the status of their dams and have determined those dams that are most in need of rehabilitation and improvement in order to guarantee their future safety and operational capacity. It was agreed that the states have an option to substitute a few of the currently selected dams with other dams, if it is found that these dams have higher needs. The second component is the dam safety institutional strengthening. The objective of the component is to support and strengthen the Dam Safety Organization (DSO) at national level in the Central Water Commission (CWC) and DSO and Water Resources Departments (WRD) in each of the four participating states, as well as the State Electricity Boards (SEB) in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

There are three components to the project, the first component being rehabilitation and improvement of dams and associated appurtenances. This component focuses on structural and non structural measures at 223 project dams, many of which are more than 25 years old. The number of dams proposed for inclusion in the project is based on proposals received from the four participating states. The states have done a review of the status of their dams and have determined those dams that are most in need of rehabilitation and improvement in order to guarantee their future safety and operational capacity. It was agreed that the states have an option to substitute a few of the currently selected dams with other dams, if it is found that these dams have higher needs. The second component is the dam safety institutional strengthening. The objective of the component is to support and strengthen the Dam Safety Organization (DSO) at national level in the Central Water Commission (CWC) and DSO and Water Resources Departments (WRD) in each of the four participating states, as well as the State Electricity Boards (SEB) in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. DSOs will become effective organizations that can take the lead in overseeing that dams remain safe from a structural and operational point of view.

PRSC are well-suited to address the challenges Vietnam currently faces. This operation aims to maintain the momentum for the reforms needed to transform Vietnam from a transition to a middle-income country. Emerging from massive poverty at the launching of Doi Moi in 1986, Vietnam is now on the verge of becoming a middle-income country. There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, in the government's drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder economy and further integrating with the region and the world. Over these years, comprehensive economic reforms have led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on poverty reduction and other development outcomes. The share of the population living below the poverty line fell by nearly half, from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are from disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic minorities) or live in more isolated regions. Attaining middle-income status is seen as more than a threshold level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, but as a way to emphasize the need for a set of modern institutions. It entails further financial deepening to support capital mobilization, the regulation of access to and pricing of infrastructure services, the gradual development of modern social insurance, more effective tools for environmental protection, legal and judiciary reforms, and the effective governance, among others. The SEDP 2006-2010 approved in June 2006 articulates this vision. As this PRSC cycle draws close to the end, the Government of Vietnam and development partners have approached the World Bank to discuss possible successor operations to PRSC. The form of such operations is still under discussion, but one possibility is an overarching instrument, which is focused on macroeconomic and a few cross-cutting issues, accompanied with more in-depth sectoral development policy operations, which would drill down to second generation reforms. A preparatory study is currently underway for this purpose. The World Bank is committed to providing assistance in a broad spectrum of areas, including social sectors, even as the country joins the ranks of middle-income countries.
