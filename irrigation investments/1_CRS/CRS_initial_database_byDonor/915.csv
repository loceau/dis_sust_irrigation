While the Master Plan is mainly focused on structural interventions and covers the whole range of water sector investments, including wastewater treatment and flood management, the Project will focus its activities on five segments of the Master Plan: (i) urban water supply, (ii) rural water supply and irrigation, (iii) irrigation system rehabilitation, (iv) soil and water conservation, and (v) small water storage structures. The Project will also address nonstructural interventions including institutional strengthening and capacity development, stakeholder participation, water tariff adjustments, integrated information management system, hydrological monitoring center, and other demand-management measures. The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, 20102016. The Project will follow the sector investment approach and finance six core subprojects that have already been prepared, as well as an undetermined number of noncore subprojects that will be prepared and approved during project implementation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-06-17,2,2,591.67,591.66998,2016-04-15,2035-10-15,.261875,8,,,,,,,,CRS 2011 data,136169218048,0,1,0,0,1,1,,3116165376,1

The TA will address important objectives of the ADB's Water Operational Plan (WOP) 2011-?2020, including policy reform (WOP, para. 3.12) and watershed development (WOP, para. 3.25). The Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) funds will directly contribute to three target outcomes of the Water Financing Program: ?500 million people provided access to safe water supply and improved sanitation,? ?integrated water resources management introduced in 30 river basins,? and ?improved water governance though national water reforms and capacity development.? ADB Loan 2962-PRC, approved on 7 December 2012, focuses on an inland waterway transport project on this river, and this activity will complement the loan by helping maintain local hydrological cycles. The TA was included in ADB's country operations business plan (2013-?2015) for nonlending products and services for the PRC in 2013. The impact of the TA will be the improved environmental quality in the Xiangjiang river watershed of CZT city cluster. The outcome will be a strengthened eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework to improve water quality and abundance in the Xiangjiang river watershed. The TA will have three outputs: (i) completed analyses of environmental threats to water quality and abundance, including their interrelationship with natural resource and land use in the Xiangjiang river watershed, (ii) recommendations for the design and implementation of an eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework, and (iii) strengthened government capacity in the environmentally sustainable use of natura",,,0,2,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2014 data,136169218048,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,3116165376,1

This PPTA is aligned with the CPS in that it is intended to assist in the establishment and operationalization of a dedicated infrastructure fund promoted by the state Government of Tamil Nadu. The PPTA is also aligned with the India Country Operations Business Plan 2016-2018, which highlights the capacity development and mainstreaming of PPPs as an important area of continued focus for ADBs engagement.b.

The impact of the project will be reduced rural poverty in 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts. The project outcome will be widened access to social services and economic opportunities. The project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs:(i) rural livelihood improved, (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced, (iii) rural transport infrastructure extended and maintained,  and (iv) project management improved.      Output 1:  Rural Livelihood Improved The project will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. This will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot/mule/link trails, 54 water supply and irrigation schemes, 10 micro-hydropower, 8 rural market places, 10 ropeways, and other community infrastructure.

However, implementation progress improved markedly with the mobilization of project implementation consultants in May 2006 and the transfer of overall project management responsibility to the Hydraulic Project Investment and Construction Management Board No.9 (ICMB9), based in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), in November 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,"01000 , 01500",,2019-09-15,2043-03-15,.044535,9.3330946,,,,,,,,CRS 2012 data,95050022912,0,0,0,1,0,1,,2746379776,1

The project will have the following outcome: social and economic status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved. Output 1: Transport infrastructure improved. The project will upgrade seven district and commune roads totaling about 121.8 km, which will improve connectivity and mobility of EMCs within seven districts with a total population of 206,700 of which an average of 48% belong to EMCs. The climate-resilient transport links will integrate remote rural production into market chains and processing facilities. Freight movement of acacia and high value crops will be improved. The effort of EMCs to dependably reach essential services including health, education, and markets will be reduced. The overall transport network will be much more efficient, reducing travel time for road users and especially improving access to health, education, and market services especially for women who already suffer from time poverty.Output 2: Water resource infrastructure improved. This output will benefit about 36,300 people through the construction, upgrade, rehabilitation, or stabilization of: (i) RDWSs to provide water to approximately 18,600 people through 115 km of piped networks, (ii) an existing reservoir to support 117 ha of irrigation command area with more reliable and efficient water supply, and (iii) cultural tourism infrastructure including one river defense - 3.6 km of embankment, visitor car parking and solid waste collection in district's communities with a total population of 17,700 of which 94% are from EMCs. Activities under this output will improve communities' health by reducing the risk of water borne diseases and will particularly benefit women by reducing their time for water collection.Output 3: Data systems for climate risk management updated. This output will provide improved access to reliable weather and climate data, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to user agencies to inform a wide range of decisions including design of climate resilient infrastructure, strengthened early warning systems, and improved disaster response.

It directly supports the Government of Viet Nam's (Government) National Target Program for New Rural Development (NRD). The PRI has deteriorated because of limited funding available for new investment and a constrained capacity to sustainably develop, manage and use the assets. This contributes to CHP's poverty by constraining rural productivity. The Project would focus on sustainably improving approximately 30 medium scale irrigation systems, and associated PRI including: rural access infrastructure, and, local markets.  In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the 30 subprojects would be selected from CHP's Socio-Economic Development Plans.  The improved PRI is expected to enable communities to respond to market signals by: increasing agricultural intensity and diversity, providing quicker and safer access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services, and, reducing costs of rural production and marketing, as well as reducing food wastage. Improved PRI increases incomes from both on- and off-farm employment, decreases the burden of chores on women, and increases food availability even when yields are constant. This is pro-poor and will be increasingly important for climate change resilience (CCR). The Project advances two key, Government supported innovations. The first innovation enhances PRI sustainability and includes good practice, which has previously not been systematically implemented by: (i) concentrating a critical mass of PRI investments in selected productive areas, (ii) having the communities prioritize the PRI improvements in and around the selected irrigation schemes, (iii) preparing PRI condition inventories and a program to update them, (iv) using whole asset life analysis with realistic maintenance assumptions as the basis for design and sustainable management, (v) improving trails and paths within the irrigation systems thus separating pedestrians and cyclists who are often women and children from motorized traffic and reducing the loss of productive land, and (vi) incorporating bio-engineering for soil and water conservation in the design thus stabilizing the local ecosystems and improving CCR. The second innovation is multi-level capacity building measures (CBM) that are gender sensitive to assist stakeholders (owners, managers and users) to sustainably develop, manage and use PRI. The CBM will have three key components: (i) Preparation of a long-term capacity building strategy, (ii) Strengthening local capacity to manage the PRI improved by the Project, and (iii) Building the local knowledge base for sustainable PRI development.
