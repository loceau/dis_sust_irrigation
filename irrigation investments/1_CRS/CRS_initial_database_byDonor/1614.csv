Related issues (Comic Relief): Education, Health, Trade, enterprise and employment. Summary: Poor farmers in northern Malawi live on what they can grow, bartering or selling any surplus food in local markets to buy clothes and essentials leaving no cash for healthcare or secondary education. Many farmers have a small amount of land available and MF and NFT are working with them to introduce suitable cash crops with a guaranteed market (e.g. paprika). Irrigated land can double the yields of these crops and protect staple foods. However, many past schemes to introduce irrigation have failed due to technical flaws, inappropriate design and lack of training. This project aims to identify schemes which can be rehabilitated, the support needs of farmers and a business case for investors. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 60 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.
