Hunger continues to be a global tragedy. The Kenyan economy has and is still largely dependent on agriculture. The high cost production system and reliance on rain fed agriculture in the face of global climate change has therefore to change and give way to a different approach in agriculture to guarantee sustainable food production by embracing low external input for sustainable agriculture. This implies that to achieve food security a change of strategy is imperative. The options available range from introducing irrigation systems using improved seed varieties that can both tolerate moisture stress and withstand pest menace as well as promote production of traditional food crops that withstand moisture stress and other adverse conditions.

Hunger continues to be a global tragedy. The Kenyan economy has and is still largely dependent on agriculture. The high cost production system and reliance on rain fed agriculture in the face of global climate change has therefore to change and give way to a different approach in agriculture to guarantee sustainable food production by embracing low external input for sustainable agriculture. This implies that to achieve food security a change of strategy is imperative. The options available range from introducing irrigation systems using improved seed varieties that can both tolerate moisture stress and withstand pest menace as well as promote production of traditional food crops that withstand moisture stress and other adverse conditions. The project will promote traditional crops by not only providing the technology ?seed? and extension services but capacitating farmers to the level that they have solid structures such as farmers marketing federation.

Very small hydropower (pico or micro hydro) is very appropriate technology in mountainous Nepal, in this project the water flow of streams is not blocked, but only small part of water flow is diverted to electricity generation and water mills. The direct beneficiaries are 155 families and the project brings remarkable social and developmental impacts into communities. Two far flung villages will receive electricity, which brings positive social benefits, promotes livelihood opportunities and reduce climate emissions by replacing the use of biomass and fossil fuels. Increasing of mechanical energy by constructing water mills will reduce the work load (of carrying grains for milling to other villages), enhances food security and promotes processing of agricultural products. The project will improve especially womens status in communities. The expected outputs of the project are:  Installation of two Pico hydro system having 5 kW power for each project, Electricity access to 155 households for lighting, operating radio and TV, Use of low electricity such as LED lamps (for all households), Establishment of at least 8 home based micro-enterprises operating directly or indirectly from the use of generated electricity, Capacity development of at least 20 beneficiaries (50% at least women) for micro-enterprise and income diversification activities, Effort will be made to link the project with financing from the financial institutions, Banks specially for promoting project based enterprises, Capacity building of 8 community members as operators and technicians for operation, maintenance of the Pico hydro system and house wiring related works involving women, Capacity building of local partner organization in the technical aspects of Pico hydro and project implementation.

Very small hydropower (pico or micro hydro) is very appropriate technology in mountainous Nepal, in this project the water flow of streams is not blocked, but only small part of water flow is diverted to electricity generation and water mills. The direct beneficiaries are 155 families and the project brings remarkable social and developmental impacts into communities. Two far flung villages will receive electricity, which brings positive social benefits, promotes livelihood opportunities and reduce climate emissions by replacing the use of biomass and fossil fuels. Increasing of mechanical energy by constructing water mills will reduce the work load (of carrying grains for milling to other villages), enhances food security and promotes processing of agricultural products. The project will improve especially womens status in communities. The expected outputs of the project are:  Installation of two Pico hydro system having 5 kW power for each project, Electricity access to 155 households for lighting, operating radio and TV, Use of low electricity such as LED lamps (for all households), Establishment of at least 8 home based micro-enterprises operating directly or indirectly from the use of generated electricity, Capacity development of at least 20 beneficiaries (50% at least women) for micro-enterprise and income diversification activities, Effort will be made to link the project with financing from the financial institutions, Banks specially for promoting project based enterprises, Capacity building of 8 community members as operators and technicians for operation, maintenance of the Pico hydro system and house wiring related works involving women, Capacity building of local partner organization in the technical aspects of Pico hydro and project implementation.

However Rent-to-Own has seen potential for growth in the lower income farmers and shop owners but has not yet explored this potential due to the high risks involved. Lower income clients are more vulnerable to changes in the market and the regular demands of life. To reach these clients a fundamental change to how the company operates will be required.  This shift is based on the key contact each client has with RtO. If the key contact the Field Officer is well trained on the specific type of business the client is operating then this Field Officer can provide in depth advice on how to succeed. The current model RtO Field Officers are operating with requires them to give advice on 7 different types of businesses and has proven to be limiting. 90% of RtO's sales come from just three products, irrigation pumps refrigeration and maize mills. Expand on the current agent network by hiring and training Field Officers to provide support to clients on how to succeed. This will be done for the top three selling products namely, maize mills irrigation pumps and refrigeration. Additional training will be provided on record keeping maintenance and marketing skills. This should allow an entirely new set of Clients to access RtO's services. This model will be trialled and implemented throughout the whole company. However in order to ring fence the FLC funding and be able to demonstrate the direct impact of the FLC funding it is our suggestion to use the FLC allocated funds for the development and implementation of this new model in Central province only.

If the key contact the Field Officer is well trained on the specific type of business the client is operating then this Field Officer can provide in depth advice on how to succeed. The current model RtO Field Officers are operating with requires them to give advice on 7 different types of businesses and has proven to be limiting. 90% of RtO's sales come from just three products, irrigation pumps refrigeration and maize mills. Expand on the current agent network by hiring and training Field Officers to provide support to clients on how to succeed. This will be done for the top three selling products namely, maize mills irrigation pumps and refrigeration. Additional training will be provided on record keeping maintenance and marketing skills. This should allow an entirely new set of Clients to access RtO's services. This model will be trialled and implemented throughout the whole company. However in order to ring fence the FLC funding and be able to demonstrate the direct impact of the FLC funding it is our suggestion to use the FLC allocated funds for the development and implementation of this new model in Central province only. RtO uses cutting-edge communications technology to manage a widespread field operation that is fast efficient and effective. A centralized cloud-based management system keeps each member of the Rent-to-Own team up to date with the latest information on their clients. RtO management team also gains access to instantaneously updated overviews of their portfolio and operations. An automated SMS system also sends clients reminders and keeps them informed of the status of their applications.",,,0,0,1,2,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2013-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2013 data,26570723328,0,1,0,1,1,1,.036513001,202114960,1

The Organisation aims to work particularly with women and young people in rural areas to imrpove their livelihood through training and linking them to sustainable markets over the long term. ETP has a total of 14 full-time employees in Lusaka and Mongu. Under this pilot project ETP will form a women and youth private sector-led cooperative composed of about 300 smallholder farmers (200 women and 100 youth). The smallholder farmers will be from within a 5km radius of Kasima in Mongu area and will form a cooperative that will use up to 40 hectares of ETP's demonstration farm. The farm will use the two solar powered centre pivots to be purchased in this project to grow crops under rotation. In addition ETP will provide seeds land preparation some key equipment transportation of produce to markets nurseries for some vegetable crops and help farmers keep production records.
