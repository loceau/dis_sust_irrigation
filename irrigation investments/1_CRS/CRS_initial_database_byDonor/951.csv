Female farmers specifically have been provided with improved technical knowledge on irrigation and farming practices to maintain during in the dry season, which has enabled them to increase their agricultural yields. With increased income and production more job opportunities have been created in the Bara, Parsa, Makwanpur and Chitwan districts of Southern Nepal where urban migration is prevalent. These increased opportunities have prompted many men to return to the rural areas to work.
