In order to implement the renewable energy component, USAID will work with the Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondurede InversiSocial, or FHIS in Spanish) on: 1) adoption of small renewable energy technologies in food insecure communities, 2) adoption of renewable energy technologies for irrigation, nutrition training centers, and small agri-businesses, and 3) provision of technical assistance and training to rural families and local organizations for the implementation and maintenance of renewable energy projects.The high-level target for this activity is to provide 10,000 poor households with access to renewable energy technologies to be used to increase productivity and nutrition. Some technologies that USAID will be promoting are small hydro-power projects focused on irrigation, small bio-gas projects linked to agricultural activities, photovoltaic systems for community centers, solar dryers and efficient cook stoves.This activity will have indirect GCC-clean energy benefits by providing renewable energy to power economic activities that will allow beneficiaries to generate enough income to move out of poverty.

Agriculture,12001,Central Government,Central Government,12000,,,,2014-07-01,2015-06-30,"As part of the Feed the Future Initiative, USAID is working with the Governments of Brazil, and Honduras to promote joint technical cooperation activities that will improve agricultural competitiveness, improve children's nutrition, and increase access to renewable energy in western Honduras. In western Honduras, more than 40 municipalities have electricity coverage below 70 percent. For example, in the department of La Paz, 45 percent of households have no access to electricity. In order to implement the renewable energy component, USAID will work with the Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondurede InversiSocial, or FHIS in Spanish) on: 1) adoption of small renewable energy technologies in food insecure communities, 2) adoption of renewable energy technologies for irrigation, nutrition training centers, and small agri-businesses, and 3) provision of technical assistance and training to rural families and local organizations for the implementation and maintenance of renewable energy projects.The high-level target for this activity is to provide 10,000 poor households with access to renewable energy technologies to be used to increase productivity and nutrition. Some technologies that USAID will be promoting are small hydro-power projects focused on irrigation, small bio-gas projects linked to agricultural activities, photovoltaic systems for community centers, solar dryers and efficient cook stoves.This activity will have indirect GCC-clean energy benefits by providing renewable energy to power economic activities that will allow beneficiaries to generate enough income to move out of poverty. This will result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, which will help mitigate climate change.",,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,0,2,2,,2016-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2016 data,18349369344,0,1,0,0,1,1,,31246068,0

KIWASH aims to enable more than 1 million Kenyans across nine counties to gain access to improved WASH services and assist households in gaining access to irrigation and nutrition services. As county governments take on responsibility for investment in and oversight of service delivery to keep their constituents healthyand their economies thrivingthere is great opportunity to expand service delivery through public-private partnerships that bring new actors into the WASH sector. KIWASH will partner with water and sanitation service providers to develop bankable business plans, improve operations, and facilitate access to financing. In parallel, behavior change communication activities linked to Community-Led Total Sanitation and hygiene will stimulate demand for improved household sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition.

Tiwalere II delivers high-impact interventions targeting children under the age of five and women, with special focus on the 1,000 days between conception and age two. The activity will finance community-level workers' efforts to consult with mothers and caregivers on the care and feeding practices of infants and young children. Tiwalere II will conduct nutrition education to improve knowledge and practices, strengthen community referral and support systems for pregnant women and children under the age of five, promote adequate women's nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and complementary feeding through social behavior change, construct boreholes and maintain non-functional ones, facilitate the creation of open defecation-free communities and promote access to improved water and sanitation services and the adoption of improved hygiene practices, and promote bed net usage to prevent malaria. The activity has interventions in irrigation farming, winter cropping, fruit tree propagation, and orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivation. The Care Group Model approach that Tiwalere provides at the community level serves as a powerful social and behavior change approach. The approach reinforces community members' confidence and the capacity and skills to act as agents of their own development process, and it fosters self reliance. The activity will improve the health and nutrition status of under-five children in targeted districts in central and northern Malawi and is fundamental to achieving Joint Regional Strategy Goal 4.3 - sustainably reducing hunger, malnutrition and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.
