The advantage of the proposed system is that the same infrastructure is used for draining the field and irrigating the crops. The system regulates the groundwater level such that it can be kept at the level, most suitable for each crop. This will increase the production. The water can also stay longer in the soil for a better uptake (absorption) of fertilizers by plants. This will reduce the costs for farmers and less nitrate will accumulate in the environment. Drained water can be brought back in the system and used again for irrigation. Another advantage of the project approach is that the pilots are directly at farm level and not at university compounds. This will link the method to leading farmers and existing projects. In total, 3 projects of 50 feddan, in 3 different governorates will be part of the approach. Objectives of the pilot are: 1. Integration of the irrigation and drainage in one system at existing agricultural plots 2. Gather data to model and assess system performance, to communicate pilot results and knowledge, and to feed further research (input to programs such as NDP III and WFP) 3. Generate support for the system at MWRI and MALR and farmer(s)-groups 4. Identify economic incentives that foster farmers to make the shift to the new water-efficient drainage and irrigation practices. For this purpose, it is imperative that cost-benefit analyses are being carried out to validate the business potential for farmers. It is likely that combined drainage and irrigation leads to: i) higher agricultural yields, ii) yields of better quality, iii) more potential for shifts to cash crops, iv) an improved income model. 5. A validation of the business model of improved drainage and irrigation on the farmer level is aspired to open the door to private investments to reach scale. Farmers involvement in the pilot is essential for reaching their support of the improved business model. 6. Develop a feasible and scalable business model for controlled drainage and sub-irrigation fur further implementation or uptake by NDP III or another project/program (e.g. WFP) in the three specified regions in upper and lower Egypt, or even beyond. 7.

For this purpose, it is imperative that cost-benefit analyses are being carried out to validate the business potential for farmers. It is likely that combined drainage and irrigation leads to: i) higher agricultural yields, ii) yields of better quality, iii) more potential for shifts to cash crops, iv) an improved income model. 5. A validation of the business model of improved drainage and irrigation on the farmer level is aspired to open the door to private investments to reach scale. Farmers involvement in the pilot is essential for reaching their support of the improved business model. 6. Develop a feasible and scalable business model for controlled drainage and sub-irrigation fur further implementation or uptake by NDP III or another project/program (e.g. WFP) in the three specified regions in upper and lower Egypt, or even beyond. 7. Develop insight in the quality of irrigation and drainage water, the suitability to re-use and raising awareness.",,,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CRS 2021 data,108358107136,0,1,0,0,1,1,.80889302,2547335936,0

It started in 2021 aiming to support the Zambezi Valley Development Agency (ZVDA) for inclusive and sustainable agricultural development in the Zambezi Valley as part of a broader package of development support involving various financial partners. The programme is considered relevant in its basic objective and approach to promote market-oriented agriculture, businesses and value chains. It consists of following components: a) Capacity building of the ZVDA to fulfill is mandate of coordinating and facilitating the socioeconomic development in the Zambezi Valley region, b) Capacity building directed at agriculture educational centers and agribusi- ness development service (BDS) providers, c) Services delivery to small farmers and small businesses. In 2018 the ISA-II programme was adjusted to integrate the Water Produc- tivity pilot project that seeks mainly to increase water use efficiency in small- holder agriculture in 4 districts of the Zambezi Valley. It is based on Farmer–led irrigation approach developed  by Wageningen University  and  largely promoted by the World Bank. Through this project, smallholder farmers are building capacities and skills that help them to adapt and mitigate negative impacts of climate change. The current proposed adjustment aims to extend the programme for one year, until December 2022. Due to cyclone Idai in 2019 and the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 in the period 2019-2021, the ISA II programme suf- fered delays in implementation and targets will not be achieved until December 2021, with the exception of the Water Productivity project implementa- tion and targets, also known as APSAN-Vale. In order to recover the delay, both the Mid Term Review carried out in 2020 and the Final Evaluation conducted in 2021 recommended the following: 1.
