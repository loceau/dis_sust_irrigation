This problem is likely to worsen as land area available for cropping falls, industrial and urban development increases, and irrigation water is lost to other uses. There is an urgent need for efficient new wheat cultivars with increased yield. This project is focusing on rust resistance, and the process of developing this resistance will establish a 'pipeline' for the application of molecular technology in wheat cultivar development. The project has three main objectives: to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of parental selection and crossing in wheat breeding programs, to use molecular technology to pyramid effective rust genes in key wheat backgrounds to develop the critical parental genotypes required by the applied wheat breeding programs, and to implement large scale marker-assisted selection in the Indian wheat breeding programs.

Iraq's agricultural sector represents a vital component of the economy as it is the largest employer (25 per cent of the labour force) and the second largest industry after oil (contribution to GDP). In the central and southern part of the country, the salinity issue has long been identified as a major threat to agriculture and has led to past government strategies aimed at improving irrigation and drainage practices. These were halted in the early 1980s because of conflict with Iran.
