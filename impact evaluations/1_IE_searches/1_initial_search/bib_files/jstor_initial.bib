abstract = {Barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] is one of the most troublesome and competitive weed species in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown under conventional flood (FLD) irrigation and is expected to be similarly damaging under alternate-wetting-and-drying (AWD) irrigation. Several indica rice genotypes have been shown to suppress E. crus-galli under FLD management, but very little is known about the nature and potential of weed suppression using AWD irrigation. In this 3-yr field study, we evaluated seven diverse rice genotypes for their weed suppression and grain yield potential under FLD and AWD irrigation. The E. crus-galli dry biomass at midseason was 11{\%} less under AWD compared with FLD. Overall, plots of an indica variety and a hybrid resulted in less E. crus-galli dry biomass under AWD compared with FLD. Grain yield in weed-free AWD plots averaged 12{\%} less than in weed-free FLD plots. Grain yield of the tropical japonica (TRJ) type, ‘Bengal', was 32{\%} lower under AWD than FLD, whereas grain yields of the two indica genotypes, PI 312777 and ‘Rondo', and a hybrid were similar in both irrigation systems. Grain yield reduction in E. crus-galli–infested AWD plots averaged greater than 90{\%}. Thus, E. crus-galli greatly reduced the grain yield of all rice genotypes tested in both FLD and AWD systems in this study. Grain yield of the indica and hybrid genotypes was relatively less affected by the AWD treatments compared with the TRJ genotypes, particularly with Bengal, suggesting that the weed-suppressive genotypes, PI 312777 and Rondo, would be better suited to AWD irrigation systems and for inclusion in weed-suppression rice-breeding programs in the southern United States.},

abstract = {The accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding the land surface–atmosphere interaction; however, current ET products have large uncertainties, and irrigation effects on ET are not well represented. In this study, the monthly ET was reconstructed (ETrecon) from GLDAS land surface models (LSMs) over the Yellow River basin of China, which was achieved by using observation-based precipitation, naturalized streamflow, and downscaled consumed irrigation water from the census annual data via an irrigation scheme. The results showed that the monthly ETrecon series were generally improved relative to the original LSM-based ET, with improvements in the correlation coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error by 0.6{\%}–1.8{\%}, 1.2{\%}–14.6{\%}, 1.3{\%}–21.0{\%}, and 2.1{\%}–20.4{\%}, respectively. The ETrecon results were also superior to the collected ET synthesis products in terms of statistics, with generally higher peak values occurring in ETrecon. Regarding the annual time scale, the ETrecon values were close to the water balance ET values, which have been widely used as benchmark data. The interannual variability in ETrecon was good overall and was associated with the LSM precipitation variability and partitioning of precipitation into ET and runoff. The reconstruction method can provide an alternative ET estimate for other river basins. This study will also be valuable for studies and applications in climate change evaluation, drought assessment, and water resources management.},

abstract = {While much research has focused on crop damage following foliar exposure to auxin herbicides, reports documenting the risk posed by exposure via root uptake of irrigation water are lacking. Herbicide residues circulated in tailwater recovery systems may pose threats of cross-crop impacts to nonresistant cultivars with known sensitivity to auxins. An auxin-susceptible soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivar was grown in a controlled growth chamber environment and exposed to dicamba dissolved in irrigation water applied to the soil surface, simulating furrow irrigation. Five herbicide treatment concentrations, ranging from 0.05 to 5.0 mg L−1 and encompassing estimated field doses of 3.1 to 310g ha−1, were applied to the soil of potted soybean plants at V3/V4 or R1 growth stages. Plant injury (0{\%} to 100{\%}), dry mass, height, number of pods, and number of pod-bearing nodes were measured. Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine treatment differences and examine dose effects. Yield losses were projected using (1) 14 d after treatment plant injury assessments based on injury–yield relationships described for foliar exposures and (2) pod counts. Dicamba concentration was the main significant factor affecting all growth response metrics, and growth stage was a significant explanatory variable only for the height response metric. A nonlinear response to dicamba dose was observed, with the threshold response dose required to affect 50{\%} of plants being three times greater for 40{\%} crop injury compared with 20{\%} injury. Yield projections derived from plant response to root uptake compared with foliar exposure indicate that soybean may express both magnitude of injury and specific symptomology differently when exposure occurs via root uptake. Drift exposure–based models may be incompatible to predict soybean yield loss when injury results from irrigation. Data are needed to develop correlations for predicting yield losses based on field-scale exposure to dicamba in irrigation water, as well as assessment of real-world concentrations of herbicide residues in tailwater recovery systems.},

This violence was the result of policies initiated by the Communist Party of Kampuchea, better known as the Khmer Rouge. To date, little research has systematically or empirically studied the geography of specific practices, notably the construction of irrigation schemes, initiated by the CPK that produced those material conditions that resulted in death and deprivation. Using satellite images, aerial photographs, archival records, and field observation, we systematically document and map Khmer Rouge irrigation schemes. Findings indicate that approximately 7,000 kilometers of canals and dikes and over 350 reservoirs were constructed during the genocide. A six-class typology is forwarded, as we argue that local hydrologic and geomorphic conditions did figure in the construction of dams, dikes, canals, and reservoirs.},

abstract = {For their investigation of the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrometeorological fields in the North American monsoon (NAM) region, Mahalov et al. used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to simulate weather over the NAM region in the summer periods of 2000 and 2012, with and without irrigation applied to the regional croplands. Unfortunately, while the authors found that irrigated agriculture may indeed influence summer precipitation, the magnitude, location, and seasonality of their irrigation inputs were substantially inaccurate because of 1) the assumption that pixels classified as “irrigated cropland” are irrigated during the summer and 2) an outdated land cover map that misrepresents known agricultural districts. The combined effects of these errors are 1) an overestimation of irrigated croplands by a factor of 3–10 along the coast of the Gulf of California and by a factor of 1.5 near the Colorado River delta and 2) a large underestimation of irrigation by a factor of 7–10 in Chihuahua, particularly in 2012. Given the sensitivity of the WRF simulations conducted by Mahalov et al. to the presence of irrigated agriculture, it is expected that the identified errors would significantly impact surface moisture and energy fluxes, resulting in noticeably different effects on precipitation. The authors suggest that the analysis of irrigation effects on precipitation using coupled land–atmospheric modeling systems requires careful specification of the spatiotemporal distribution of irrigated croplands.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Groundwater depletion ignores the political boundaries of western states, the legal boundaries of western water codes, and the jurisdictional boundaries of western water federalism. In the wake of the groundwater revolution, it is becoming apparent that certain interstate lawsuits derive essentially from deeper conflicts rooted in the clash between surface-water and groundwater irrigation communities—and their respective political cultures. The interstate divide may be yielding to the hydrological divide. This article attends to that deeper relationship between irrigation agriculture and political culture across the Great Plains. Part I provides a brief history of its surface-water irrigation communities, to compose a recognizable image of their political culture: one that is rooted in classical western water law and cooperative water federalism, and depends upon interstate compacts and federal irrigation projects. Part II surveys the groundwater revolution and the distinct political culture it has generated: one that doubts the merits of classical western water law, and suspects the power of western water federalism. Part III describes a revealing theater of the conflict between these political cultures: the Republican River Basin. On the surface, the conflict is a legal casus belli between sovereign states. But beneath that conflict lies a deeper and more intractable conflict, where interstate litigation becomes recognizable as a proxy battle between surface-water and groundwater irrigation communities. How the states and the United States resolve this deeper conflict may determine the future of water federalism across the Great Plains—and the fate of the rivers upon which its communities depend.},

This study examines themeteorological impacts of irrigation during this drought through observations and model simulations using the Community Land Model coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Asimple parameterization of irrigation processes is added into the WRF Model. In addition to keeping soil moisture in irrigated areas at a minimum of 50{\%} of soil moisture hold capacity, this irrigation scheme has the following new features: 1) accurate representation of the spatial distribution of irrigation area in the study domain by using a MODIS-based land surface classification with 250-m pixel size and 2) improved representation of the time series of leaf area index (LAI) values derived from crop modeling and satellite observations in both irrigated and nonirrigated areas. Several numerical sensitivity experiments are conducted. The WRF-simulated temperature field when including soil moisture and LAI modification within the model is shown to bemost consistent with ground and satellite observations, all indicating a temperature decrease of 2–3K in irrigated areas relative to the control run. Modification of LAI in irrigated and dryland areas led to smaller changes, with a 0.2-K temperature decrease in irrigated areas and up to a 0.5-K temperature increase in dryland areas. Furthermore, the increased soil moisture and modified LAI are shown to lead to statistically significant increases in surface divergence and surface pressure and to decreases in planetary boundary layer height over irrigated areas.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Formal legal systems comprise a major part, but not the only part, of the “rules of the game” that structure social and social-ecological interactions. Throughout the twentieth century, centralization and consolidation of legal authority were dominant themes among many, if not all, legal systems. That process may have been successful in some cases, but in others the presumed economies of scale from consolidation and centralization either did not materialize or were offset by other social costs, including the failure to accommodate local knowledge, expertise, and preferences. In what could become a theme of the twenty-first century, many countries, including developing countries, have started to experiment with more polycentric legal systems, as the Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom referred to them, where local users and user groups have a substantial say in designing and administering rules that apply to them. This case study of Kenya amounts to a history of trial-and-error in efforts to develop an effective legal regime to govern use of irrigation water, in a country that has suffered for more than a century from seasonal water scarcity, inefficient water use, and user conflicts over water resources. From colonial efforts to import British riparian law to complete centralization of legal authority early in the post-colonial period, pressure on irrigation water resources and water users only increased. Beginning in 2003, however, the government of Kenya has been engaged in a process that is not one of simple decentralization or devolution of authority; rather, it is a story of increasing polycentricism, with meaningful participation by local, regional, and national actors in law-making and administration. The starting point actually occurred in 1997, when local water users (advised by NGOs) formed Kenya's first Water User Association (WUA) to help avoid and minimize local water-use conflicts. It worked so well that the national government took notice. In 2003, Kenya's parliament enacted a brand new Water Act, which not only legally recognized the existing WUA, but actively encouraged and facilitated the creation of what the statute referred to as Water Resources Users Associations (WRUAs). This move to polycentricism appears to have reduced problems, including conflicts, relating to periodic water shortages; and recently drafted (but not yet adopted) legislative proposals would have the effect of strengthening Kenya's embrace of polycentric legal control over irrigation water management.},

abstract = {Over the last 10 yr, California has experienced a series of ever-worsening droughts. Rice, traditionally a flooded crop, has come under increasing scrutiny with respect to its water use, leading to proposals to evaluate alternative irrigation systems. For growers, weed competition is one of the most limiting factors to maintaining high yields, so understanding the shifts among species in weed communities under the proposed alternative irrigation systems is vital. A field study was conducted from 2012 to 2014 to compare weed population and growth dynamics with three irrigation systems: (1) a conventional water-seeded control system (WS-Control), with a permanent flood of 10 to 15 cm from planting until 1 mo prior to harvest; (2) a water-seeded alternate wet and dry system (WS-AWD), with the field flooded from planting until canopy closure, after which floodwater was allowed to subside and the field was reflooded when the soil volumetric water content reached 35{\%}; and (3) a drill-seeded alternate wet and dry system (DS-AWD), with rice drill seeded and then flush irrigated to establish the crop, after which the field was flooded until canopy closure and then underwent an alternate wet and dry (AWD) treatment similar to WS-AWD. In the AWD treatments, there were two drying periods, neither of which occurred after the heading stage. The dynamics of major weed species were evaluated using plant density counts (2012) and relative cover and biomass (2013 and 2014). Grasses (sprangletop and watergrass species) dominated the DS-AWD system; sedges, broadleaves, and grasses dominated both WS systems. The WS-AWD system increased smallflower umbrella sedge relative cover at canopy closure, relative dry weight at harvest, and percent frequency when compared with the WS-Control system. Yields did not differ across treatments when weeds were controlled (P {\textgreater} 0.05); in the absence of herbicides, yields in the WS-AWD were equivalent to the WS-Control (ranging from 40 to 65{\%} of the herbicide-treated yields) and zero in the DS-AWD due to weed pressure.},

Field experiments were conducted in 2015-2016 (year 1) and 2016-2017 (year 2) at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Balm, FL, to evaluate weed control and strawberry tolerance to herbicides applied through the drip irrigation. 2940 g ai ha−1 EPTC, 105 g ai ha−1 flumioxazin, 570 g ai ha−1 fomesafen, 52 g ai ha−1 halosulfuron, 3585 g ai ha−1 napropamide, oxyfluorfen 560 g ai ha−1, and 1070 g ai ha−1 S-metolachlor were applied through a single drip tape at 7 or 14 d prior to transplanting. Halosulfuron was the most injurious herbicide, causing 18 and 46{\%} injury at 35 d after transplanting (DATP) in year 1 when the herbicide was applied 7 and 14 d prior to transplanting, respectively. However, strawberry plants recovered from the initial injury and there was no reduction in total berry yield. None of the other herbicides evaluated elicited significant crop injury nor reduced berry yield. Averaged over application timings, EPTC, fomesafen, and napropamide suppressed yellow nutsedge emergence to 49, 64, and 41{\%} of the nontreated control, respectively. Flumioxazin, fomesafen, and halosulfuron suppressed black medic emergence to 55, 52, and 55{\%} of the nontreated control, respectively. None of the herbicides evaluated adequately suppressed Carolina geranium. Overall, results suggest that the evaluated herbicides with the exception of halosulfuron are safe for use on strawberry and would give growers an alternative management option. Drip-applied herbicides permit application closer to the transplant date and would be helpful as part of a weed control program for weed suppression.},

abstract = {We use original water user group (WUG) data from a reservoir irrigation system in China to examine the effect of water pricing policies on farmers' water saving behaviors. The introduction of volumetric water pricing at the group level, to replace area-based pricing, induces institutional change to prevent each member's overuse of water when the volumetric price levels are moderate. Depending on the initial conditions, the multiple pathways of change lead to new institutional arrangements, with all of them contributing to water savings. However, when the price is set high enough, many farmers exit a WUG for private irrigation. This tendency is associated with an increased probability that the remaining members do not undertake institutional change and that they do not end up saving water. This may be due to the increased management difficulties among the remaining members whose fields are separated by former members who have now opted out for private irrigation across the WUG. As a result, we do not find evidence that the reservoir water is saved at high volumetric price levels. {\textcopyright} The Author 2015.},

Results include a statistical analysis of the impact of 2,000 residential sprinkler audits in Colorado and guidance for future conservation program design. Analysis of water billing records from at least two years pre- and two years post-irrigation audit from five seasons (2007–2012) were used to answer key questions about irrigation audit impact on water use as well as to understand factors that contribute to water savings from irrigation programs. While the average water savings one year post-audit were 5,000 gal/participant and median savings were 2,000 gal/participant, high variability among savings beyond one year suggests that audits may not produce as robust long-term benefits.},

abstract = {Cotton and peanut grown under irrigation make up over 769,000 ha in the Southeast USA. The consumptive use of water for irrigation has significantly impacted groundwater resources, spring flows and streamflows in many parts of this region, particularly during severe droughts. This situation is further complicated with extreme weather events and climate variability. In this study, we compare yields and water use in a non-irrigated sod-based rotation system (SBR; bahiagrass–bahiagrass–peanut–cotton) to an irrigated conventional rotation system (ICR; peanut–cotton–cotton). Root mass of oat cover crop following peanut or cotton in a SBR and ICR system was also measured. A soil water assessment model (SWAT) was used to simulate irrigation water demands over a 34 yr period (1980–2013) under different soil types to quantify water saving potential of SBR. The average peanut yield in ICR from 2002 to 2013 was 4509 kg ha−1, while that in SBR was 4874 kg ha−1. Likewise the average cotton yield in ICR during the same period was 1237 kg ha−1, while that in SBR was 1339 kg ha−1. Oats had greater root mass in SBR than ICR. Simulation results indicate that crops in SBR consistently had substantially lower irrigation requirements (between 11 and 22 cm yr−1) than those in ICR in dry years. The water-saving potential of SBR varies positively with increasing sand content in soil.},

Gross irrigation required (GIR) was calculated using parcel and high-resolution site data. Seven-and-a-half percent of customers used no irrigation over the study period, 67{\%} of customers used 1 in./month or less, and 84{\%} used less than the average monthly GIR of 2.2 in./month. Eighty-five percent of customers were classified as occasional irrigators, whereas only 2{\%} were classified as high irrigators. With such low estimated irrigation demands, this study reinforces the importance of selecting conservation methods so as to not inadvertently increase irrigation.},

abstract = {Studies suggest that disturbance-induced reductions in soil seedbank density are diminished by periods of water scarcity after soil disturbance; however, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the effects of increasing time between soil disturbance and flood irrigation on disturbance-induced reductions in soil seedbank density, and (2) to identify specific soil moisture levels that cause seedbank reductions under flood irrigation. Weed species in this study were junglerice, Palmer amaranth, and yellow foxtail. For Objective 1, artificial seedbanks with known numbers of seeds were disturbed 10, 3, or 0 d prior to flood irrigations under field conditions. For Objective 2, seeds were buried in soil mesocosms that were hydrated to specific soil water potentials (flooded, 0 kPa, −30 kPa, −60 kPa, and −180 kPa) and placed in laboratory conditions favorable for germination. For both objectives, seeds were recovered to determine the percentages of buried seeds that survived the disturbance or moisture treatments. Results for the field study indicated that soil disturbances reduced seedbank persistence of Palmer amaranth but did not affect seedbank persistence of junglerice and yellow foxtail. Disturbance-induced reductions in seedbank density were greatest when soil was disturbed 0 and 3 d prior to flood irrigations. For the laboratory study, results showed that waterlogged soil was not required for seedbank losses because rates of seedbank persistence were greater in saturated soils (0 kPa and flooded) compared to the lower moisture levels. These studies indicate that delays in irrigation can reduce the seedbank reduction potentials of soil disturbance events. Further, irrigation timing effects on disturbed soil seedbanks are likely to occur in all irrigation systems, including those that reduce the amount of water applied compared to flood irrigation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In the United States, irrigation represents the largest consumptive use of freshwater and accounts for approximately one-third of total water usage. Irrigation impacts soil moisture and can ultimately influence clouds and precipitation through land–planetary boundary layer (PBL) coupling processes. This study utilizes NASA's Land Information System (LIS) and the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting Model (NU-WRF) framework to investigate the effects of drip, flood, and sprinkler irrigation methods on land–atmosphere interactions, including land–PBL coupling and feedbacks at the local scale. To initialize 2-day, 1-km WRF forecasts over the central Great Plains in a drier-than-normal (2006) and a wetter-than-normal year (2008), 5-yr irrigated LIS spinups were used. The offline and coupled simulation results show that regional irrigation impacts are sensitive to time, space, and method and that irrigation cools and moistens the surface over and downwind of irrigated areas, ultimately resulting in both positive and negative feedbacks on the PBL depending on the time of day and background climate conditions. Furthermore, the results portray the importance of both irrigation method physics and correct representation of several key components of land surface models, including accurate and timely land-cover and crop-type classification, phenology (greenness), and soil moisture anomalies (through a land surface model spinup) in coupled prediction models.},

I ask why development schemes were so heavily focused on drainage and irrigation (D{\&}I), how this focus was justified, and whether there is another way to think about the possibilities for development in Guyana in the future. It is argued that, in Guyana, various development actors attempt to relocate what they perceive to be the previous regimes failures through discourses on racial and political difference. Their solutions to these problems are often subsequently portrayed as corrections to the failures of the previous regime despite the significant repetition of certain themes. Finally, it offers insight into how these development projects might be reconsidered.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Significant increases in summer precipitation have occurred in the midwestern United States over the last century for reasons that remain unclear. It is postulated that the expansion of irrigation and cropland in the central United States over the past 60 yr has been a major contributor to these observed increases in precipitation. As a first step toward attribution of these precipitation changes, a detailed analysis of observed daily summer precipitation frequency and intensity is conducted for the contiguous United States over multiple spatial scales and time periods from 1895 to 2011. Robust increases in precipitation frequency, total precipitation, and moderate to heavy precipitation intensity are identified during July and August in the midwestern United States. Analysis of changes in mean monthly precipitation from the early to late twentieth century initially points to increasing frequency as the source of increasing monthly precipitation in the midwestern United States during the summer, especially during August; however, these large frequency increases are not unique to the summer. On the other hand, changes in precipitation intensity and total precipitation are both greatest during July and August and coincide spatially in the midwestern United States. Additionally, the greatest intensity change occurs downwind of the most heavily irrigated regions, especially for the period between 1950 and 1980 when irrigation rapidly intensified. Thus, the seasonality and location of these regional signatures of increasing precipitation intensity (and total precipitation) are found to be broadly consistent with spatiotemporal trends in irrigation and cropland in the central United States and may be indicative of a causal link.},

A potentially valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at adequate time (daily) and space ({\~{}}10 km or less) resolutions desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large uncertainty.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Native shrublands and their associated grasses and forbs have been disappearing from the Great Basin as a result of grazing practices, exotic weed invasions, altered fire regimes, climate change and other human impacts. Native forb seed is needed to restore these areas. The irrigation requirements for maximum seed production of four key native forb species (Eriogonum umbellatum, Lomatium dissectum, Penstemon speciosus, and Sphaeralcea grossulariifolia) were studied at the Oregon State University Malheur Experiment Station beginning in 2005. Species plots were supplied with 0, 100, or 200 mm of subsurface drip irrigation per year using a randomized complete block design with four replications. Irrigation in each plot was divided into four equal increments applied between bud and seed set with timing dependent upon the flowering and seed set phenology of each species. Seed was harvested in each year of production through 2011, and the optimal irrigation rate was determined by regression. The four native forb species differed in their responses to irrigation. Lomatium dissectum seed yields were optimized with 140 mm of irrigation. Eriogonum umbellatum seed yields were optimized with 173 to 200 mm of irrigation in dry years and progressively less to no irrigation in the wettest year. Penstemon speciosus seed yields were optimized with 107 mm of irrigation in dry years and were reduced by irrigation in wet years. Sphaeralcea grossulariifolia seed yields did not respond to irrigation. Water requirements of these species are low, and these results can be used by seed growers to produce native forb seed more economically.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Human alteration of the land surface hydrologic cycle is substantial. Recent studies suggest that local water management practices including groundwater pumping and irrigation could significantly alter the quantity and distribution of water in the terrestrial system, with potential impacts on weather and climate through land–atmosphere feedbacks. In this study, the authors incorporated a groundwater withdrawal scheme into the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4). To simulate the impact of irrigation realistically, they calibrated the CLM4 simulated irrigation amount against observations from agriculture censuses at the county scale over the conterminous United States. The water used for irrigation was then removed from the surface runoff and groundwater aquifer according to a ratio determined from the county-level agricultural census data. On the basis of the simulations, the impact of groundwater withdrawals for irrigation on land surface and subsurface fluxes were investigated. The results suggest that the impacts of irrigation on latent heat flux and potential recharge when water is withdrawn from surface water alone or from both surface and groundwater are comparable and local to the irrigation areas. However, when water is withdrawn from groundwater for irrigation, greater effects on the subsurface water balance are found, leading to significant depletion of groundwater storage in regions with low recharge rate and high groundwater exploitation rate. The results underscore the importance of local hydrologic feedbacks in governing hydrologic response to anthropogenic change in CLM4 and the need to more realistically simulate the two-way interactions among surface water, groundwater, and atmosphere to better understand the impacts of groundwater pumping on irrigation efficiency and climate.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The current research examines the influence of irrigation on urban hydrological cycles through the development of an irrigation scheme within the Noah land surface model (LSM)–Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) system. The model is run at a 30-m resolution for a 2-yr period over a 49 km² urban domain in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. A sensitivity analysis indicates significant sensitivity relative to both the amount and timing of irrigation on diurnal and monthly energy budgets, hydrological fluxes, and state variables. Monthly residential water use data and three estimates of outdoor water consumption are used to calibrate the developed irrigation scheme. Model performance is evaluated using a previously developed MODIS–Landsat evapotranspiration (ET) and Landsat land surface temperature (LST) products as well as hourly ET observations through the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS). Results show that the Noah LSM–SLUCM realistically simulates the diurnal and seasonal variations of ET when the irrigation module is incorporated. However, without irrigation, the model produces large biases in ET simulations. The ET errors for the nonirrigation simulations are −56 and −90 mm month−1 for July 2003 and 2004, respectively, while these values decline to −6 and −11 mm month−1 over the same 2 months when the proposed irrigation scheme is adopted. Results show that the irrigation-induced increase in latent heat flux leads to a decrease in LST of about 2°C in urban parks. The developed modeling framework can be utilized for a number of applications, ranging from outdoor water use estimation to climate change impact assessments.},

abstract = {In India wheat is conventionally planted on flat-bed and irrigation is applied by flooding, which results in low water-use efficiency. Efficient use of irrigation water is a major researchable issue in most command areas for improving crop productivity. Resource conservation technologies aimed at improving productivity and water-use efficiency such as raised-bed planting have been found useful in wide row crops like maize, cotton, sunflower, sugarcane, etc. However, such information is not available for a relatively narrow row crop like wheat. A field experiment was conducted during 2002–04 at New Delhi on a sandy loam soil to evaluate the performance of wheat crop under resource conservation techniques (RCTs), viz. furrow-irrigated raised-bed (FIRB), broad-bed and furrow (BBF), raised-bed and sunken-bed (RBSB) and conventional flat-bed (FB) in main plots, and 4 irrigation regimes, viz. irrigation only at crown root initiation (CRI); irrigation at 0.9 and 1.2 IW/CPE (irrigation water/cumulative pan evaporation) ratio and irrigations at six critical physiological growth stages in subplots. Wheat performed equally well under all the RCTs with respect to grain yield. The maximum grain yield was recorded under 1.2 IW/CPE ratio, which was at par with 6 irrigations at critical growth stages, but significantly higher than 0.9 IW/CPE and one irrigation at CRI. Bed planting techniques involving FIRB and BBF recorded significantly lower consumptive use (CU) of water than RBSB and FB. There was saving of 18.2 to 19.5{\%} irrigation water by adopting FIRB compared to FB with flood irrigation. Water-use efficiency under FIRB and BBF was 8.3–22.8 and 4.9–24.8{\%} higher respectively over the FB with flooding.},

abstract = {This article presents a systematic procedure to quantify savings potential of single-family residential irrigation demand management strategies that can be used to evaluate the optimal blend of these strategies to achieve specified goals. Current irrigation practices, irrigable area, and irrigation application rate are derived for each single-family residence based on parcellevel tax assessor's data linked to customer-level monthly water billing data. Water savings are calculated directly as the difference between current and proposed use after implementation of a management option for each residence. This information is used to develop performance functions that estimate total water savings as a function of the number of implementations for each residence. This procedure allows demand management options to be compared directly with other supply augmentation options when determining the optimal blend. Probabilistic models are derived from benchmark parcel-level datasets for evaluation of other utilities where direct measurements are unavailable.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Because of the limitations of coarse-resolution general circulation models (GCMs), delta change (DC) methods are generally used to derive scenarios of future climate as inputs into impact models. In this paper, the impact of future climate change on irrigation was investigated over China using the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4), which was calibrated against observed irrigation water demand (IWD) at the provincial level. The results show large differences in projected changes of IWD variability, extremes, timing, and regional responses between the DC and bias-corrected (BC) methods. For example, 95th-percentile IWD increased by 62{\%} in the BC method compared to only a 28{\%} increase in the DC method. In addition, a shift of seasonal IWD peaks (averaged over the country) to one month later in the year was projected when using the BC method, whereas no evident changes were predicted when using the DC method. Furthermore, low-percentile runoff has larger impacts in the BC method compared with proportional changes in the DC method, indicating that hydrological droughts seem to be exacerbated by increased climate variability. The discrepancies between the two methods were potentially due to the inability of the DC method to capture the changes in precipitation variability. Therefore, the authors highlight the potential effects of climate variability and the sensitivity to the choice of particular strategy-adjusting climate projection in assessing climate change impacts on irrigation. Some caveats, however, should be placed around interpretation of simulated percentage changes for all of China since a large model bias was found in southern China.},

abstract = {The Conserve Florida Water Clearinghouse has developed Internet-based software called EZ Guide to assist Florida water utilities in evaluating water use efficiency. This modeling approach estimates single-family outdoor water use for every parcel using a uniform statewide property appraisers' database to estimate irrigated area for each parcel. Billing data are needed to estimate the irrigation application rates for each parcel, although few utilities have used the available data for this purpose. Analyses using these unique databases for a benchmark utility in Florida provide new insights into the overall impact of single-family outdoor water use and cost-effective management options. A key result is that only a small percentage of homes are large irrigators, which makes them candidates for irrigation best management practices. However, this study also shows a dramatic rise in the prevalence of inground sprinkler systems over the past few decades, which has led to increased irrigation application rates.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this study, the authors incorporate an operational-like irrigation scheme into the Noah land surface model as part of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). A series of simulations, with and without irrigation, is conducted over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) for an extremely dry (2006) and wet (2007) year. The results show that including irrigation reduces model bias in soil moisture and surface latent heat (LH) and sensible heat (SH) fluxes, especially during a dry year. Irrigation adds additional water to the surface, leading to changes in the planetary boundary layer. The increase in soil moisture leads to increases in the surface evapotranspiration and near-surface specific humidity but decreases in the SH and surface temperature. Those changes are local and occur during daytime. There is an irrigation-induced decrease in both the lifting condensation level (ZLCL) and mixed-layer depth. The decrease in ZLCL is larger than the decrease in mixed-layer depth, suggesting an increasing probability of shallow clouds. The simulated changes in precipitation induced by irrigation are highly variable in space, and the average precipitation over the SGP region only slightly increases. A high correlation is found among soil moisture, SH, and ZLCL. Larger values of soil moisture in the irrigated simulation due to irrigation in late spring and summer persist into the early fall, suggesting that irrigation-induced soil memory could last a few weeks to months. The results demonstrate the importance of irrigation parameterization for climate studies and improve the process-level understanding on the role of human activity in modulating land–air–cloud interactions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The rapid expansion of irrigation in the Great Plains since World War II has resulted in significant water table declines, threatening the long-term sustainability of the Ogallala Aquifer. As discussed in Part I of this paper, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) was modified to simulate the effects of irrigation at subgrid scales. Simulations of nine April–October periods (three drought, three normal, and three pluvial) over the Great Plains were completed to assess the full impact of irrigation on the water budget. Averaged over all simulated years, irrigation over the Great Plains contributes to May–September evapotranspiration increases of approximately 4{\%} and precipitation increases of 1{\%}, with localized increases of up to 20{\%}. Results from these WRF simulations are used along with a backward trajectory analysis to identify where evapotranspiration from irrigated fields falls as precipitation (i.e., irrigation-induced precipitation) and how irrigation impacts precipitation recycling. On average, only 15.8{\%} of evapotranspiration from irrigated fields falls as precipitation over the Great Plains, resulting in 5.11 mm of May–September irrigation-induced precipitation and contributing to 6.71 mm of recycled precipitation. Reductions in nonrecycled precipitation suggest that irrigation reduces precipitation of moisture advected into the region. The heaviest irrigation-induced precipitation is coincident with simulated and observed precipitation increases, suggesting that observed precipitation increases in north-central Nebraska are strongly related to evapotranspiration of irrigated water. Water losses due to evapotranspiration are much larger than irrigation-induced precipitation and recycled precipitation increases, confirming that irrigation results in net water loss over the Great Plains.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Since World War II, the expansion of irrigation throughout the Great Plains has resulted in a significant decline in the water table of the Ogallala Aquifer, threatening its long-term sustainability. The addition of near-surface water for irrigation has previously been shown to impact the surface energy and water budgets by modifying the partitioning of latent and sensible heating. A strong increase in latent heating drives near-surface cooling and an increase in humidity, which has opposing impacts on convective precipitation. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) was modified to simulate the effects of irrigation on precipitation. Using a satellite-derived fractional irrigation dataset, grid cells were divided into irrigated and nonirrigated segments and the near-surface soil layer within irrigated segments was held at saturation. Nine April–October periods (three drought, three normal, and three pluvial) were simulated over the Great Plains. Averaging over all simulations, May–September precipitation increased by 4.97 mm (0.91{\%}), with localized increases of up to 20{\%}. The largest precipitation increases occurred during pluvial years (6.14 mm; 0.98{\%}) and the smallest increases occurred during drought years (2.85 mm; 0.63{\%}). Precipitation increased by 7.86 mm (1.61{\%}) over irrigated areas from the enhancement of elevated nocturnal convection. Significant precipitation increases occurred over irrigated areas during normal and pluvial years, with decreases during drought years. This suggests that a soil moisture threshold likely exists whereby irrigation suppresses convection over irrigated areas when soil moisture is extremely low and enhances convection when antecedent soil moisture is relatively high.},

abstract = {Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to determine tolerance of tomato to halosulfuron, imazosulfuron, and trifloxysulfuron herbicides applied through drip irrigation. In greenhouse studies, PRE- and POST-applied trifloxysulfuron caused greater tomato injury (14 and 54{\%} injury, respectively) than PRE- and POST-applied halosulfuron (5 and 26{\%} injury, respectively) or imazosulfuron (5 and 23{\%} injury, respectively). All herbicide treatments in the greenhouse studies caused greater injury to tomato than the nontreated. Greater tomato injury was observed in the greenhouse from herbicides applied POST than when soil applied. Tomato injury from POST-applied halosulfuron, imazosulfuron, or trifloxysulfuron followed a linear relationship, with tomato injury increasing with increasing herbicide rate. Tomato photosynthetic rate did not differ among the herbicide treatments (32.7 to 55.0 $\mu$mol m −2 s −1 ) and the nontreated (38.0 to 55.0 $\mu$mol m −2 s −1 ). At 5 to 16 days after treatment (DAT), tomato treated with imazosulfuron POST (0.26 to 0.46 cm s −1 ) or trifloxysulfuron POST (0.27 to 0.51 cm s −1 ) had lower stomatal conductance compared to the stomatal conductance of the nontreated tomato (0.65 to 0.76 cm s −1 ).

abstract = {Koa (Acacia koa A. Gray [Fabaceae]) seedlings were grown with subirrigation and overhead irrigation systems in an effort to characterize post-nursery field performance. One year following outplanting, we found no differences in seedling height or survival, but root-collar diameter was significantly larger for subirrigated seedlings. This indicates that koa seedlings, with equal or better morphological quality compared with overhead irrigated seedlings, can be effectively produced using subirrigation systems, thus allowing for potential reductions in water use and wastewater during nursery culture.},

However, the overall impression is that they are capital-intensive and suited to large farms. In this context, a study was undertaken in nine states, mainly to examine the actual area covered compared to the potential area and to understand the adoption level of MI as well as to analyse the cost and returns under different farm categories. The results indicated that only about 9{\%} of the MI potential is covered in the country. Key suggestions include reduction in capital cost of the system, provision of technical support for operation after installation, relaxation of farm size limitation in providing subsidies and the establishment of a single state level agency for implementation of the programme.},

Keeping in view this assertion, the intent of this paper is to estimate the supply and demand coupled with projections for future in various sectors of economy. The study provides information on water balance and water use efficiency estimate in the competing sectors. The total water available is 274 BCM, of which 130 BCM is available for use, however 62 BCM is lost in the system besides out flow to the sea. The empirical results further revealed that gross water supply for agriculture was nearly 190 BCM while its demand was 210 BCM showing a shortfall of about 20 BCM. The projected estimates showed that this gap would be further widened by 27 BCM in the year 2015. The crop consumptive use is only 68 BCM and the remaining water is lost in the system. The domestic and Industrial supply and demand showed a shortfall of 5 BCM and 0.15 BCM respectively in the corresponding year. The irrigation application efficiency is 35 percent which abysmally low. Therefore, sound water management strategies are required to increase water productivity, minimize water losses and build a consensus on water dams.},

Substantial funds have been allocated to adopt the "best practices" of hiring external water engineers to construct modern systems to replace those that farmers built. These expensive investments have infrequently led to long-term improvement in the operation of irrigation systems in Asia. In this article, we examine the process and impact of an innovative irrigation assistance project that was initially undertaken in Nepal in the mid-1980s. We analyze data obtained over three time periods related to changes in system structure and performance over time. We trace the unfolding patterns of improved engineering infrastructure across time depending on the way it interacts with other factors to affect long-term irrigation performance. We examine some of the key variables that are likely to affect the diverse and complex patterns of change. We also undertake analysis of the configurai impact of core variables using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We find that the initial and later investments in system infrastructure are only one factor that helps to generate short-term improvement. Unless farmers encourage local entrepreneurs and organize themselves, create their own rules or use sanctions, and augment their rules through collective action, infrastructure investment alone is not sufficient to achieve sustainable higher performance.},

The majority have no source of clean domestic water supply, frequently relying on nearby irrigation water for all their needs. Over 50 per cent of the population are infected with schistosomiasis and other water-borne diseases. This paper examines the problems in one such village, Taweel, and suggests options for improving the supply. After discussing the physical and institutional environment governing water supply, the paper reviews the status of other water supply schemes in the area. It shows that many are in a poor condition because of lack of funding, insufficient staff and poor consideration of operation and maintenance. A review of possible water supply options suggests three possible solutions: a pipeline from a borehole in a nearby village; simple treatment of the irrigation water flowing through the village; and the construction of an infiltration gallery in a nearby main irrigation canal. The paper concludes that there is insufficient information available to make a final decision on the best option but the proposals can form the foundation for further data collection and stakeholder consultation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A novel method is introduced for integrating satellite-derived irrigation data and high-resolution crop-type information into a land surface model (LSM). The objective is to improve the simulation of land surface states and fluxes through better representation of agricultural land use. Ultimately, this scheme could enable numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to capture land–atmosphere feedbacks in managed lands more accurately and thus improve forecast skill. Here, it is shown that the application of the new irrigation scheme over the continental United States significantly influences the surface water and energy balances by modulating the partitioning of water between the surface and the atmosphere. In this experiment, irrigation caused a 12{\%} increase in evapotranspiration (QLE) and an equivalent reduction in the sensible heat flux (QH) averaged over all irrigated areas in the continental United States during the 2003 growing season. Local effects were more extreme: irrigation shifted more than 100 W m−2 from QH to QLE in many locations in California, eastern Idaho, southern Washington, and southern Colorado during peak crop growth. In these cases, the changes in ground heat flux (QG), net radiation (RNET), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and soil moisture (SM) were more than 3 W m−2, 20 W m−2, 5 mm day−1, 0.3 mm day−1, and 100 mm, respectively. These results are highly relevant to continental-to-global-scale water and energy cycle studies that, to date, have struggled to quantify the effects of agricultural management practices such as irrigation. On the basis of the results presented here, it is expected that better representation of managed lands will lead to improved weather and climate forecasting skill when the new irrigation scheme is incorporated into NWP models such as NOAA's Global Forecast System (GFS).},

Household-level water demands are estimated so that adjustments at both the intensive and extensive margins are captured. The results show that a large gap exists between the cost of water and the value of water to producers. Simulation analysis shows that reforming water pricing can induce water savings. However, the price of water needs to be raised to a relatively high level. We also find that the value-based policy is more effective than the cost-based policy since it generates larger water savings, given the same increase in the average price of water. While raising the price of water negatively affects crop production and crop income, higher water prices do not adversely affect the distribution of household income. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

In order to achieve maximum benefits to society, water should be allocated toward uses that have the highest value, followed, as an alternative, by the next highest level or one with equal value. Such decisions require knowledge of water value at the last unit of use. Within agriculture, irrigation is important. Irrigation water must be allocated to various crops; therefore, producers require knowledge of the marginal value of water among alternative crops. This study estimates marginal value product for irrigation water within the southern areas of the Canadian Prairie Provinces using a crop-response model. Marginal values were estimated under the present and a future climate scenario. Cash crops such as potatoes and dry beans had higher marginal values of water, around {\$}1,000 per 1,000 m3. Cereals and oilseed crops lagged behind (close to {\$}200 per 1,000 m3). Results show modest increases in marginal value under climate change, compared to the volatility resulting from commodity market price changes seen today.},

abstract = {The aim of the investigation was to determine if the CWSI could be used to determine when the irrigation water should be applied to maize under Hungarian changeable weather. Three water treatments were applied: "Ad libitum" watering in lysimeter's growing chambers, irrigated treatment (use of CWSI), and rainfed control. The theoretical approximation of crop water stress index was applied in our long-term investigation. Among the 17 consecutive seasons between 1989 and 2005 included in the study there were seven arid and four humid seasons. The remaining summers had semi-humid character. To represent the influence of drought on water stress index of maize we chose the year of 2000, the driest and warmest season from the beginning of weather observations of Keszthely. As a counterpoint stress index results of 1997 served as an example of humid seasons. The degree of the deviation in CWSI as a result of different weather may vary, but the tendency in arid or humid seasons remained the same. The basic parameter of CWSI, the canopy temperatures were measured using a hand-held infrared thermometer. Relevant meteorological and plant data were collected locally. Our final conclusion was that there is no problem in use of CWSI during arid summers, where radiation is undisturbed and the cloudiness does not disturb the canopy temperature sampling. In arid seasons increases in assimilatory surface size and yield of maize in irrigated treatments were between 20–35{\%} and 10–30{\%}, respectively. The extra production seems to be enough to cover the irrigation costs. There is also no problem in humid seasons, where the sky is often covered by clouds, but there is no need to irrigate maize in Hungary. In semi-humid weather not only the environmental circumstances may disturb the plant temperature measurements and calculation of CWSI (doubtful results caused by changeable radiation and wind), but the probable yield surplus – below 5{\%} – is also negligible. The irrigation costs are higher than the production gain during semi-humid seasons. In Hungary about one third of the seasons have characteristics of an arid weather where sampling of canopy temperatures provides reliable basis to calculate CWSI and plan irrigation timing.},

This misfortune occurred again in 2006 at approximately the same growth stage. Therefore, the objectives of the studies were redirected to measure the impact of actual hail events on corn leaf area index (LAI) and the competitive interaction of escaped Palmer amaranth populations induced by hail across different levels of irrigation and corn populations. In 2005, the study treatment with the lowest corn population and level of irrigation had twice the Palmer amaranth biomass (PABM) at corn harvest compared with the highest corn population and irrigation level. Corn LAI produced simple linear models that predicted both corn grain yield and PABM. In 2007, the nonhail year, PABM was depressed 4- to 15-fold compared with hail years. PABM declined linearly from 417 kg/ha at the lowest level of irrigation and corn population to 48 kg/ha at the highest level of irrigation and corn plant population. Although economic return per increment of irrigation declined in both hail years, the trends in economic returns were still positive. This suggests that a producer with similar conditions should continue to irrigate even though his or her rate of economic return is reduced.},

The Scripps Experimental Climate Prediction Center (ECPC) Regional Spectral Model (RSM) was used to simulate climate under two land surface characteristics: potential natural vegetation and modern land use that includes irrigation and urbanization. In irrigated cropland, soil moisture was prescribed in three different ways: 1) field capacity, 2) half of field capacity, and 3) no addition of water. In the most realistic case of half-field capacity, the July daily minimum temperature in the California Central Valley increased by 3.5°C, in agreement with station observation trends over the past century in the same area. It was found that ground heat flux efficiently keeps the surface warm during nighttime due to increased thermal conductivity of wet soil.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of energy and water potential of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey. This integrated socioeconomic development project is one of the largest of its kind in the world. The GAP region is rich in water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. The Euphrates and Tigris Rivers represent over 28{\%} of the nation's water supply by rivers, and the economically irrigatable areas in the region make up 20{\%} of those for the entry country. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GWh/yr, but only 125 GWh/yr of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which are under construction, 36{\%} of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. The GAP region has a 22{\%} share of the country's total hydroelectric potential, with plans for 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants. Once completed, 27 billion kWh of electricity will be generated annually.},

A reduced form of this model is empirically estimated using a sample of 265 farms located in Crete, Greece. The empirical results suggest that farmers choose to adopt the new technology in order to hedge against production risk. In addition, we show that the farmer's human capital also plays a significant role in the decision to adopt modern, more efficient irrigation equipment.},

abstract = {A field experiment was conducted near Davis, CA, during the 2003 and 2004 summer growing seasons to compare weed control, yield, and fruit quality in different irrigation and tillage systems in processing tomato. Trial design was a subplots with the main plots as subsurface drip irrigation or furrow irrigation, subplots were standard tillage or conservation tillage, and sub-subplots were herbicide or no herbicide. The hypothesis was that subsurface drip irrigation could limit surface soil wetting and thus inhibit germination and growth of weeds equal to or better than standard tillage and/or herbicides. In both 2003 and 2004, weed densities in the subsurface drip irrigation treatments were over 98{\%} lower than the levels in furrow irrigation treatments. In addition, weed densities were lower in the subsurface drip-conservation till-no herbicide treatment than in any of the furrow irrigation treatments, including the furrow irrigation-standard tillage-herbicide treatments. The time required for a hand-hoeing crew to remove weeds was 5 to 13 times greater in furrow irrigation treatments compared to subsurface drip irrigation treatments. Weed biomass on beds at tomato harvest was 10 to 14 times greater in the furrow systems as compared to the subsurface drip irrigation systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of subsurface drip irrigation in controlling weed germination and growth, compared to tillage or herbicide applications. Tomato yield was higher in the subsurface drip irrigation treatment compared to furrow irrigation in 2004. Herbicide treatment increased yield in 2004, but only in the furrow irrigation treatment in 2003. Fruit brix level was not related to treatment in 2003, but was lower in the subsurface drip irrigation plots in 2004. These results indicate that subsurface drip irrigation can reduce weed competition in conservation tillage systems, without requiring herbicide applications.},

Some scholars suggest that the patterns of construction, deterioration, rehabilitation, and modernization commonly found among irrigation agencies in these countries are rational because of the time inconsistency problem of information. I argue instead, using panel data from the Philippines, that the problem of poor performance is linked to inherent incentive problems faced by public bureaucracies, how these incentives became entrenched in the path dependence of irrigation development, and how these were reinforced by incentives embedded in irrigation aid, particularly by the moral hazard problem and the fungibility of irrigation aid.},

By comparing irrigation institutions under different property rights, the study identifies the significant factors that contribute to the success and sustainability of irrigation institutions. It is found that albeit the physical characteristics of irrigation systems and the heterogeneities of the members of the user groups do impact the outcome, it is the institutional environment as reflected in the presence of clear as well as flexible systems of rules and regulations, enforcement mechanisms, nesting and networking of such institutions etc. that have become the most crucial determinants. For this, presence of able and fair leadership and the manoeuvring of various sources of power are found to be essential.},

As a direct consequence, farmers are turning to groundwater for their irrigation needs. Booming groundwater irrigation has become the mainstay of Indian farming but it has also all but wrecked the country's power economy because of perverse policies of pricing of electricity for agriculture. Yet, there is no firm strategy of dealing with these and other challenges. Other south Asian countries are in much the same boat. Based on two spells of fieldwork in six provinces of north China, this article shows that, facing much the same problems as its south Asian neighbours, China is responding differently to its water problems. This is by no means a suggestion that the approaches China is trying out would work in India - or even in China itself. However, by including China's experience in its discussions, Indian policy-makers will clearly have a wider repertoire of institutional alternatives with which to experiment.},

abstract = {Although water is crucial to the performance of preemergence herbicides, pesticide performance has rarely been related to irrigation management. This 2-yr study investigated the effect that amount of irrigation water applied had on activity of simazine. Three rates of simazine at 0, 1.12, and 2.24 kg/ha were applied to a 3-yr-old nectarine orchard that was irrigated with micro-sprinklers. The performance of simazine was compared between irrigation treatments initially targeted to provide water at 110 (efficient) and 175{\%} (overwatered) of crop water requirements. Simazine effectiveness was based on the survival of oat and cucumber plants that were seeded at 0, 14, 28, 56, and 84 d after herbicide application. A longer time interval to 50{\%} survival indicated prolonged herbicidal activity. Results were consistent between years in that simazine's performance was consistently greater in efficient irrigation treatments. The greatest increases were measured at the higher simazine application rate (2.24 kg/ha); overall averages for the length of time to reach 50{\%} survival for cucumber were 50 and 23 d and for oats were 55 and 15 d for efficient and overwatered irrigation treatments, respectively. Use of an efficient irrigation management technique could have enhanced simazine's performance through a decreased leaching of residues from the weed root zone or less chemical or biological degradation (or both). Adoption of efficient irrigation management has been identified as a best management practice to mitigate leaching of pesticide residues to groundwater in coarse soils in California. This study indicates that efficient irrigation improves simazine performance and that both factors, pesticide application and irrigation management, should be considered when developing a weed management system.},

Soybean densities following emergence were 247,000, 475,000, and 729,000 plants/ha. Glyphosate was applied at 0.56 kg ai/ha at the V2; V4; V2 and V4; and V2, V4, and R2 stages of soybean. In dry portions of the growing season, glyphosate increased moisture availability for dryland soybean because of control of hemp sesbania and pitted morningglory. As soybean population increased from 247,000 to 729,000 plants/ha, pitted morningglory and hemp sesbania control increased from 60 to 91{\%}, respectively, for the V2 glyphosate application. Control of both species at 14 wk after emergence was at least 90{\%} following the V4 alone treatment and sequential applications, with no differences in control among soybean populations. Untreated, irrigated hemp sesbania produced up to 32 million seeds/ha in 1999. Irrigation did not influence pitted morningglory seed production either year, and untreated pitted morningglory produced a maximum of 1 million seeds/ha in 1998 at 247,000 soybean plants/ha. Three sequential applications of glyphosate reduced pitted morningglory seed production to 9,000 seeds/ha and eliminated hemp sesbania seed production. Soybean yielded 1,297 kg/ha greater under irrigated than dryland conditions, whereas increasing soybean density from 247,000 to 729,000 plants/ha resulted in 416 kg/ha improvement in seed yield. At the densities of pitted morningglory and hemp sesbania present in this study, seed yield of drill-seeded soybean can be maximized following a V4 alone treatment or sequential glyphosate applications.},

Four treatments included the application of simazine at 2.0 kg ai ha⁻¹ without irrigation incorporation and the application of simazine at 2.0 kg ai ha⁻¹ with three levels of irrigation incorporation (0.5, 1.25, and 1.75 cm of water).

Simazine concentrations in runoff water from the first simulated rainfall event averaged 0.85, 0.77, 0.45, and 0.30 mg L⁻¹ for treatments without irrigation incorporation and for those receiving 0.5, 1.25, and 1.75 cm of water incorporation, respectively; simazine concentration in runoff water from the second event applied 1 wk later averaged 0.42, 0.38, 0.21, and 0.16 mg L⁻¹, respectively. Total simazine mass recovered in runoff water from both simulated rainfall events was estimated to be 6.5, 6.0, 3.6, and 2.5{\%} of the application for treatments without irrigation incorporation and for those receiving 0.5, 1.25, and 1.75 cm of water incorporation, respectively. Applying sufficient water for herbicide incorporation into the soil matrix is a practical approach to mitigate off-site movement from the soil.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problems of estimating irrigation water demand. We propose an original method of estimation in two steps. First, we develop a dynamic programming model in order to explain the optimal irrigation management plan. Based on a microeconomic approach describing the farmer's behavior, this economic model, introducing an agronomic model, and an algorithm of solution search, is used to compute a realistic database. Second, these data are used to estimate profit functions by a non-parametric method. The irrigation water demand function is estimated using a non-parametric derivation procedure.An application to irrigation water demand is proposed in the southwestern area of France where conflicts appear frequently. The same results appear for different climates: for small quantities of water available, irrigation water demand seems to be quite inelastic. If one increases the total quantity of water available, the shape of the curve changes and the demand appears more elastic. The threshold price at which the changes in price-responsiveness appears, depends on weather conditions and range from 0.30 F/m3 in a wet year to 1.60 F/m3 in a dry year. These results are crucial information for the regulator in order to analyze the effects of a water regulation policy, based on prices. The impact of an increase in the water price will depend not only on the climate but also on the location of the initial and final prices on the demand function.JEL classification: C14, C16, Q15},

abstract = {Could the simplifying assumptions made in project appraisal be so far from the truth that the expected benefits of public investments are not realized? Using data for Vietnam, commonly used estimates of the benefits from irrigation investments based on means are compared with impacts assessed through an econometric modeling of marginal returns that allows for household and area heterogeneity using integrated household-level survey data. The simpler method performs well in estimating average benefits nationally but can be misleading for some regions, and, by ignoring heterogeneity, it overestimates gains to the poor and underestimates gains to the rich. At moderate to high cost levels, ignoring heterogeneity in impacts results in enough mistakes to eliminate the net benefits from public investment. When irrigating as little as 3 percent of Vietnam's nonirrigated land, the savings from the more data-intensive method are sufficient to cover the full cost of the extra data required, ignoring other benefits from that data.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The post–World War II increase in irrigation in the Great Plains represents the largest human-induced hydrologic impact in North America. Drawn primarily from the High Plains aquifer, water applied as irrigation in the region amounts to billions of cubic meters (2 × 1010 m³ in 1990) annually and is applied to more than 60 000 km² of farmland. Following studies by Schickedanz and by Barnston and Schickedanz, empirical orthogonal functions and precipitation magnitude comparisons were employed to examine trends in precipitation over the region and to determine if this enormous addition of irrigation water to the surface has had a measurable influence on precipitation during the summer months of June, July, and August. The Barnston and Schickedanz study observed a transition from unirrigated to heavily irrigated conditions; in contrast, this examination focused on a more recent period during which irrigation took place throughout the time of interest. Loading patterns and temporal precipitation trends for 1950–97 show, at best, slight evidence that irrigation induces rainfall. The most prominent evidence of an irrigation effect is found in the Texas Panhandle for 1950–82. If irrigation-induced rainfall exists, its impact is only minor relative to the natural determining factors of plains climate. It also is possible that the chief influence of irrigation on rainfall may take place at some threshold magnitude of irrigation (not explored in this study) that already had been exceeded by 1950.},

An analysis of the experience of the programme shows that farmers' involvement in water management has indeed led to a better and smoother resolution of irrigation-related conflicts. However, the other expectation that the programme would reduce state expenditure has not materialised as yet. Water users' associations will have to be more efficient in making allocative and investment decisions. For this a clarification of legal rights is imperative.},

abstract = {Increasingly, sewage effluent will be used for urban and agricultural irrigation. The main concern is the potential for infectious diseases in form workers and city dwellers exposed to the effluent, as well as in people who consume crops irrigated with effluent, especially when those crops are eaten raw or brought raw into the kitchen. prevention requires adequate disinfection of the effluent. The effluent also must meet normal irrigation water requirements for parameters such as salt content, sodium adsorption ratio, trace elements, and so forth. Unfortunately, little or no attention is paid to long-term effects of sewage irrigation on underlying groundwater. Since most of the water applied for irrigation in dry climates evaporates, the concentrations of non-biodegradable chemicals in the drainage or deep-percolation water going down to the groundwater can be much higher than in the effluent itself (about five times higher for an irrigation efficiency of 80 percent). These chemicals comprise not only the salts, nitrates, and possible pesticide residues normally expected in irrigated agriculture , but also "sewage chemicals" like synthetic organic compounds, disinfection by-products, pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutically active chemicals like endocrine disrupters, and falvic and humic acids. These acids are known precursors of disinfection by-products that are formed when the drainage water ends up in drinking-water supplies that are then chlorinated. Thus, groundwater below sewage-irrigated areas eventually may become unfit for drinking,which raises questions of liability. More research on long-term effects of sewage irrigation on groundwater is urgently needed.},

The parameters approached were the depth to water-table, crop yields, cropping pattern, abandoned lands, water distribution, and seepage reduction, etc. The results showed that some of these, including the depth to water-table, seepage reduction, and cropping pattern compared well with previous technical studies, while some others did not. The physical interventions of the project under quick evaluation comprised concrete lining of about 170 kms of the distributary canals and 352 kms of surface drains.
