abstract = {This paper addresses water-related issues in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Irrigation development and providing water for human consumption have been key factors in the country's rural development planning, notably during the post-apartheid era when the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and Water Services Act and Free Basic Water of 1997 became effective. By exploring the use of water in rural villages in the central Eastern Cape, the paper addresses the conceptual and practical limitations of the provisioning of water for human consumption and irrigation, in particular, and how this is being handled by various implementing agencies. The paper draws attention to the importance of 'irrigation by night' which refers to unplanned and 'unlawful' water-use practices. People in villages 'unlawfully' re-appropriate piped water for irrigation purposes to produce food and generate some income. The paper proposes a shift away from the rigid conceptualisations that currently form the backbone of planning to instead adopt a multiple-use system (MUS) approach which is more in tune with local practices currently observed in rural villages of South Africa.},

abstract = {The Colorado River is overdrawn. Decisions made a century ago created an institutional framework allowing overuse while climate change has exacerbated it with increasing temperatures and reduced natural flows. ‘Demand management', a key component of the 2019 Upper Basin Drought Contingency Plans, would utilize water conserved from consumptive use to create a 500,000 acre-foot storage pool, only used to protect the Upper Basin of the Colorado River in the event they were unable to meet water delivery obligation to the Lower Basin. Rural irrigators on Colorado's West Slope would be the prime contributors to such a program, but largely responded with ambivalence. Increasingly, collaborative water governance is cited as the best way to create change in water distribution. However, if rural irrigators respond with ambivalence, why would they participate voluntarily in such a program? Using a grounded theory approach, interviews and focus groups with 45 participants, and participant observation, I explore why rural irrigators were ambivalent towards a program that would, ostensibly, protect them in times of water shortage. Drawing from the concept of sociological ambivalence and the literatures of water justice, hydrosocial analysis, and rurality, I describe the symbolic and material landscape that shapes perceptions of ‘demand management'. I argue irrigators were ambivalent because they understood the need for water conservation, but they also perceived injustice in terms of distribution, recognition, and representation. Since rural irrigators are the linchpin in any water conservation program that would address overuse in the Colorado River Basin, their perceptions of injustice must be addressed. Findings provide key insight into water governance as it relates to crafting effective water policy.},

abstract = {Catchment managers are interested in understanding impacts of the management options they promote at both farm and regional scales. In this third paper of this series, we use Inteca-Farm, a Bayesian network model of farm irrigation in the Shepparton Irrigation Region of northern Victoria, Australia, to assess the current condition of management outcome measures and the impact of historical and future management intervention. To help overcome difficulties in comprehending modeling results that are expressed as probability distributions, to capture uncertainties, we introduce methods to spatially display and compare the output from Bayesian network models and to use these methods to compare model predictions for three management scenarios. Model predictions suggest that management intervention has made a substantial improvement to the condition of management outcome measures and that further improvements are possible. The results highlight that the management impacts are spatially variable, which demonstrates that farm modeling can provide valuable evidence in substantiating the impact of catchment management intervention.},

abstract = {Irrigation is important to many agricultural businesses but also has implications for catchment health. A considerable body of knowledge exists on how irrigation management affects farm business and catchment health. However, this knowledge is fragmentary; is available in many forms such as qualitative and quantitative; is dispersed in scientific literature, technical reports, and the minds of individuals; and is of varying degrees of certainty. Bayesian networks allow the integration of dispersed knowledge into quantitative systems models. This study describes the development, validation, and application of a Bayesian network model of farm irrigation in the Shepparton Irrigation Region of northern Victoria, Australia. In this first paper we describe the process used to integrate a range of sources of knowledge to develop a model of farm irrigation. We describe the principal model components and summarize the reaction to the model and its development process by local stakeholders. Subsequent papers in this series describe model validation and the application of the model to assess the regional impact of historical and future management intervention.},

abstract = {In this study, a deficit irrigation program was investigated for its impact on cucumber crop yield (Cucumbis sativus L.) planted in an open field and a greenhouse using a drip irrigation system during 2008-2011 growing seasons. The irrigation treatments were four levels of ETc (40, 60, 80 and 100{\%}) in addition to the traditional practice of local farmers. At 60 and 80{\%} ETc treatments, the deficits of irrigation were tested at different growth stages (development, middle and late stages of growth) for a total of 12 treatments in each experiment; furthermore, three replicates for each treatments were carried out. The data showed that the cucumber could tolerate a shortage of water during the middle season growth stage for both the greenhouse and the open field, and the crop response factor (Ky) values ranged between 0.57-0.76 and 0.96-1.02 for the greenhouse and the open field respectively. The amount of water used in 100{\%} ETc was much lower than that of the traditional drip irrigation used by farmers, moreover the crop water productivity (CWP) values increased when the water amount decreased. The results also indicated that the highest values for CWP were found in the most stressed treatments of 40{\%} ETc, and on the other hand the overall productivity decreased.},

abstract = {A comparative analysis of irrigation related issues and effectiveness of water policies in India and Australia is conducted to help share the learning from each other's experience in sustainable irrigation management. Keeping in pace with the global trend of implementing a sustainable water management program, India has adopted the concept of participatory irrigation management (PIM) while Australia has adopted irrigation management transfer (IMT) program. PIM in India is regarded as experimentation in diverse socio-economic settings with mixed results while IMT in Australia has achieved a high level of water use efficiency. Australian irrigation industry is currently driven by market mechanisms where water trading is expected to lead to greater efficiency. However, there are concerns that sole reliance on water use (or economic) efficiency objective may conflict with the objectives of social equity and ecological sustainability. Similar to Australia, there is an opportunity for water markets in India. However, conflict in the objectives of efficiency, equity and sustainability constrain the debate of establishing water markets in India. The comparative analysis indicates that despite both countries have a common goal of sustainable water management, their strategies differ. Nevertheless, India can emulate many of the Australian experiences in water policy reforms, entitlements, institutional arrangements, and corporate style of management while Australia can adopt the best Indian traditions of decentralized participatory and community management for sustainable irrigation water management.},

abstract = {The paper presents a decision support designed to conduct an economic-environmental assessment of the agricultural activity focusing on irrigation called ‘Decision Support for IRRigated Agriculture' (DSIRR). The program describes the effect at catchment scale of choices taken at micro scale by independent actors, the farmers, by simulating their decision process. The decision support (DS) has been thought of as a support tool for participatory water policies as requested by the Water Framework Directive and it aims at analyzing alternatives in production and technology, according to different market, policy and climate conditions. The tool uses data and models, provides a graphical user interface and can incorporate the decision makers' own insights. Heterogeneity in preferences is admitted since it is assumed that irrigators try to optimize personal multi-attribute utility functions, subject to a set of constraints. Consideration of agronomic and engineering aspects allows an accurate description of irrigation. Mathematical programming techniques are applied to find solutions. The program has been applied in the river Po basin (northern Italy) to analyze the impact of a pricing policy in a context of irrigation technology innovation. Water demand functions and elasticity to water price have been estimated. Results demonstrate how different areas and systems react to the same policy in quite a different way. While in the annual cropping system pricing seems effective to save the resource at the cost of impeding Water Agencies cost recovery, the same policy has an opposite effect in the perennial fruit system which shows an inelastic response to water price. The multidimensional assessment conducted clarified the trades-off among conflicting economic-social-environmental objectives, thus generating valuable information to design a more tailored mix of measures.},

abstract = {Effective water management requires a large-scale understanding of
agricultural irrigation systems and how they shift in response to
various stressors. Here, we leveraged advances in Machine Learning and
availability of very high resolution remote sensing imagery to help
resolve this long-standing issue. To this end, we developed a deep
learning model to classify irrigation systems at a regional scale using
remote sensing imagery. After testing different model architectures,
hyper parameters, class weights and image sizes, we selected a U-Net
architecture with a Resnet-34 backbone for this purpose. We applied
transfer learning to increase training efficiency and model performance.
We considered four irrigation systems as well as urban and background
areas as land use/ cover classes, and applied the model to 8,600 very
high resolution (1 m) images, labeled with ground-truth observations of
irrigation types, in a case study in Idaho, USA. Images were obtained
from the US Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Imagery
Program. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance for
segmentation of different classes on the train data (85{\%} to 94{\%}),
validation data (72{\%} to 86{\%}), and test data (70{\%} to 86{\%}), which
attests to the efficacy of the model for the segmentation of images
based on spatial features. Aside from leveraging deep learning and
remote sensing for resolving the standing real-world problem of multiple
irrigation type segmentation, this study develops and publicly shares
labeled data, as well as a trained deep learning model, for irrigation
type segmentation that can be applied/transferred to other regions
globally. Furthermore, this study offers novel information about the
impacts of transfer learning, imbalanced training data, and efficacy of
various model structures for multiple irrigation type segmentation.},

abstract = {With the rewritten Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution and the National Water Law of 1992, Mexico embarked on an ambitious program of transferring the management of many irrigation systems to local user groups, primarily farmers. By 1996, 372 water user associations had been formed to control water delivery to 2.92 million hectares. During this time water prices increased by 45-180{\%} and government O{\&}M subsidies were eliminated. Limited economic analysis of stakeholder impact has been conducted of the irrigation management transfer (IMT) program. This research effort pilots a partial budget analytical framework for analyzing the social benefits and costs of IMT. Two irrigation modules near Culiacan, Sinaloa were selected as case studies. Results reveal that even with significantly higher water prices, water users have invested more in their systems than during the post-IMT period and consider their overall irrigation costs to be lower. Lower transaction costs in the pre-IMT period explain the majority of these cost savings. Efforts to quantify incremental benefits and costs associated with IMT at the module and district levels proved difficult given the unavailability of reliable, time series information.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Water resources around the world are under increasing pressure from growing populations and the matching demand for food. Climate change is making its presence felt through trends to decreased rainfall and increased temperatures and evaporation rates, resulting in longer and more frequent spells of dry weather. Urban areas are competing more strongly with irrigated agriculture, industry and the environment for a share of the water supply. Urban water demand management has thus come into sharper focus as an integral part of any sustainable water management strategy.    Urban irrigation, the watering of lawns and garden beds in the residential sector and irrigation of public open spaces like sporting grounds and parks, forms a significant component of urban water demand. Irrigation demand provides, in theory, more scope and opportunities for demand reduction and water use efficiency than indoor water demand, but in practice indoor demand has received greater levels of attention and investment from urban water service providers. This is because urban irrigation demand and its water saving potential, influenced by a complex set of climatic, biophysical, technological and behavioural factors, are relatively more difficult to analyse and predict. A random approach to the development of outdoor demand management programs, the lack of evaluation of such programs where they exist, and reliance on mandatory water restrictions for achieving reductions in demand, are symptoms of the problem.    The thesis seeks to address the problem by proposing a modelling framework based around the concepts of landscape irrigation budget and water saving potential, and argues that the proposed framework provides a rational and systematic approach to development of demand management policies and programs for urban irrigation through its capacity to: (a) develop irrigation benchmarks and budgets for different urban landscape types located in different soil–climate zones; and (b) evaluate the effectiveness of demand management programs and policies.    The thesis explores this proposition by applying the proposed concepts and framework to a selection of domestic gardens attached to single detached dwellings located in the local government areas of Kogarah and Penrith, representing two different soil–climate zones within the Greater Sydney Metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia. The research methodology integrates the following: (a) a survey of domestic gardens, using aerial photographs, to characterise them with respect to their area, water use and microclimate characteristics; (b) building a conceptual biophysical model using a rational approach to estimate landscape irrigation budget for those gardens; (c) estimating irrigation budgets for gardens in the two areas; (d) water demand modelling using historical metered water consumption data (for a period when there were no water restrictions) to estimate the water saving potential of those gardens; and (e) analysis of historical metered consumption data (for a period when water restrictions were imposed) to evaluate the effectiveness of restrictions as urban irrigation demand management policy.    The proposed concepts and modelling framework incorporate a well-defined and measurable indicator (landscape irrigation budget) and a monitoring and evaluation framework (water saving potential), both of which are crucial to facilitating sustainable management of any natural resource. In addition, the modelling framework developed in the thesis is simple, transparent, adaptable and flexible, the characteristics that make a decision-making model effective.},

abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is adapting to viability challenges due to water contamination from mining in various ways. We explore the option of using crops that are able to tolerate the impacts of such water contamination as a short term adaptation strategy. We present a framework which enables the selection of crops suitable for irrigated production using mining contaminated water. The framework identifies key factors that should inform crop selection; and these include crop adaptation to climatic conditions, contaminants present in water, crop tolerance to contaminants, crop use and accumulation of toxic metals. A proposed process for screening and selecting a crop is described. Although considered a partial analysis due to incomplete and non-standardised information on crop tolerance levels, the framework narrows down choices which can be assessed in more detail or with field trials. The framework shows that interventions beyond the farm level are necessary to support the use of contaminant tolerant crops as a strategy for adapting to water contamination from mining. However, key questions regarding the risks associated with alternative crops and difficulties in selecting suitable crops remain.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: As a direct link between farmers and manufacturers of
technologies, the characteristics and activities of input suppliers can
be expected to play an important role in the generation and diffusion of
innovations in agricultural systems. While the agricultural innovation
systems (AIS) literature recognises the importance of input suppliers,
there are few studies from the Global South assessing the nature and
implications of their activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to
improve the understanding of how input suppliers can influence the
functioning and development of AIS in the Global South. METHODS: We
first adapt the `functions of innovation systems' framework to examine
the role of these private sector actors in an AIS, identifying three
activity categories, through which input suppliers can influence the
AIS: market creation for technological innovations, the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, and influence on technology priorities. We
then apply the framework to a case study of the small-scale irrigation
sector in Kenya. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The case study documents the
emergence of a new cohort of irrigation-equipment suppliers during the
period of strong growth in the market for small-scale irrigation
technologies since 2000, and examines how they affect the small-scale
irrigation agricultural innovation system (SIAIS). We find that Kenyan
irrigation-input suppliers perform important activities and roles in the
SIAIS aside input supply, notably provision of advisory services,
improvement of the supply chain for irrigation technologies,
introduction and adaptations of new types of irrigation equipment, and
facilitation of access to farm credit. Irrigation-input suppliers in
Kenya thus play an important role in the functionality of the SIAIS,
particularly regarding knowledge creation and dissemination.
SIGNIFICANCE: The novelty of the paper lies in its empirical assessment
of input suppliers in the small-scale irrigation sector and its
application of the functions framework. The paper shows that input
suppliers can become effective agents of knowledge diffusion once the
market has reached a sufficient size and documents how they contributed
to knowledge development as they develop, adapt and test specific
irrigation equipment. The paper also emphasises that input suppliers can
form a key link between national AIS and foreign companies, as they
bring in foreign expertise (know-how) to the market along with
agricultural technologies. We therefore suggest that policy
interventions in support of smallholder irrigation should seek leverage
from the growth and capacities of input suppliers as a complement to
public research and extension.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for up-scaling field irrigation losses and quantifying relative losses at the irrigation area level for potential water savings. Two levels of analysis were considered: First, the field level where irrigation is applied. Second, the irrigation area level, where the field level losses are aggregated, or up-scaled, using average loss functions. In this up-scaling approach, detailed crop-soil-water modelling can capture the variability of physical parameters (such as soils, crops, water table depth, and management practices) at the field level which are then used to derive loss functions for aggregating losses at higher scales (irrigation area level). This allows potential field-level adaptations and water management changes made by individual farmers to be assessed for impact at the larger irrigation area level. The APSIM farming systems model was used for simulation of crops (wheat, rice, and soybean) and their interaction with the wider system processes at the field level. Given the climate, soil, and management information (sowing, fertilisation, irrigation, and residue management), the model simulates infiltration, the soil moisture profile, plant water uptake, soil evaporation, and deep drainage on a daily basis. Then, by placing the field level analysis in the context of the wider irrigation system or catchment, it is possible to correlate field level interventions (e.g. water savings measures) with water requirements at these higher levels. Application of this method in the Coleambally Irrigation Area in NSW, Australia, demonstrated that an exponential function can describe the relationship between deep drainage losses and the water table depth for different soil, crop, and water table depth combinations. The rate of loss increase (slope of the curve) with the water table depth is higher on lighter (higher intake rates) soils than on heavy soils and is more pronounced in areas under rice cultivation. We also demonstrate that this analysis technique can assist in identifying spatial distribution of losses in irrigation areas, considering water table depth as an additional factor, leading to targeted areas for water-saving measures.},

abstract = {The water flow and the mass transport of agrochemicals in the unsaturated and saturated zone were simulated in the extended alluvial basin of Keritis river in Crete, Greece (a predominantly flat and most productive citrus growing area) using the hydrological model MIKE SHE. This model was set up based on information on land use, geology, soil structure, meteorological data, as well as groundwater level data from pumping wells. Additionally, field measurements of the soil moisture at six different locations from three soil depths (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 m) were used as targets to calibrate and validate the unsaturated flow model while for saturated condition, groundwater level data from three well locations were used. Following the modeling approach, the agrochemical mass transport simulation was performed as well, based on different application doses. After the successful calibration processes, the obtained 1D modeling results of soil moisture-pressure related to soil depth at different locations were used to design a proper and cost-effective irrigation programme (irrigation timing, frequency, application rates, etc.) for citrus orchards. The results of the present simulation showed a very good correlation with the field measurements. Based on these results, a proper irrigation plan can be designed at every site of the model domain reducing the water consumption up to 38{\%} with respect to the common irrigation practices and ensuring the citrus water productivity. In addition, the effect of the proposed irrigation scheduling on citrus yield was investigated. Regarding the agrochemical concentration in the groundwater for all dose cases was below the maximum permissible limit. The only exception was for the highest dose in areas where the water table is high. Thus, this modeling approach could be used as a tool for appropriate water management in an agricultural area estimating at each time and location the availability of soil water, contributing to a cost-effective irrigation plan.},

abstract = {The article describes a new modelling approach and module for soil
salinity management. The two major objectives of the module are to
simulate the seasonal course of the salinity of the soil solution in the
active root zone of drip-irrigated crops to assist irrigators to
optimise irrigation and salt leaching, and to help evaluate the salt
fluxes in the deep percolating water for assessing the longer-term salt
load of the irrigated crops on the regional ground and surface water
resources. The module is based on the solutions of the DIDAS program for
quasi-steady water flow and uptake for various drip irrigation
scenarios, and on differentiating the applied water to evaporation from
the soil surface, uptake by the plant roots, deep percolation through
the root zone that leaches salt out of it, and deep percolation outside
of the root zone that does not leach salts. After laying out the
rationale behind the suggested approach and outlining the expressions
used in the module for evaluating the salinity of the root zone, several
sample computations, in silico experiments, are performed to illustrate
the module functionality and its potential application, and to serve for
sensitivity analysis of the system parameters. Additional investigation
is needed into the adequacy of the suggested modelling approach and the
developed module to simulate soil salinity in the active root zone.

abstract = {The broadcast fertilization method is widely used under basin irrigation in China. A reasonable broadcast fertilization method can effectively improve application performance of fertilization and reduce pollution from non-point agricultural sources. In this study, firstly, a non-uniform broadcast fertilization method and a non-uniform application coefficient were proposed. The value of non-uniform application coefficient is defined in this paper. It represents the ratio of the difference between the maximum and the average fertilization amount of fertilizer applied on the basin surface to the average fertilization amount of fertilizer applied on the basin surface. Secondly, field experiments were conducted to study the movement characteristics of fertilizer under non-uniform broadcast fertilization for basin irrigation. Field experiment results showed that under the condition of basin irrigation, the non-uniform broadcast fertilization method could weaken the non-uniform distribution of fertilizer due to erosion and transport capacity of solid fertilizer by irrigation water flow, which could significantly improve the uniformity of soil solute content. Thirdly, the solute transport model for broadcast fertilization was corroborated by the field experiment results. The variation rule of fertilization performance with non-uniform application coefficient under different basin length and inflow rate was achieved by simulation. The simulation results showed that fertilization uniformity and fertilization storage efficiency increased first and then decreased with the increase of non-uniform application coefficient. In order to be practically applicable, suitable irrigation programs of non-uniform application coefficient under different basin length and inflow rate conditions were proposed by numerical simulation.},

abstract = {While determining the water balance for large irrigation schemes, coping with complexities and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater (GW) abstraction is still a challenge. On other hand, estimating GW abstraction is of paramount importance to ensure the proper management of surface and GW resources. Although, there are number of well-known methods exist to map GW abstraction, utilization-factor (Uf) is considered as a reliable method. However, at large scales, tubewells utilization time required for Uf method is difficult to retrieve as large and small tubewells are governed under different rules. Geo-informatics is another emerging approach being used to estimate GW abstraction, however, there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in characterizing GW abstraction using satellite remote sensing imagery that leads to inaccurate end results. In current study, in-situ GW measurements were performed to calibrate and validate the GW abstraction estimated from geo-informatics approach at Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area of the Indus basin of Pakistan. For in-situ measurements, an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at a grid size of 1 km at 30 locations situated at head, middle and tail end reaches of the LBDC. For the geo-informatics approach used in this study, GW abstraction is considered as a difference of actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) from net canal water use and effective rainfall after satisfying soil moisture storage changes. Results of calibration of geo-informatics approach compared with the in-situ measurements showed R² of 0.89, 0.81 and 0.79 at head, middle and tail end reaches, respectively. Intra-grid annual comparison of in-situ measurements showed that tubewells were being governed by different rules and thus yielded different abstraction within a grid ranging from 854 mm (±105) at head, 742 mm (±220) at middle and 649 mm (±244) at tail grids. Statistical analysis showed that annual GW abstraction by in-situ measurements at head 814 mm (±52), middle 769 mm (±44) and tail 688 mm (±56) end reaches varied significantly at a confidence interval of 95{\%}. The spatial mapping by geo-informatics showed that farmers' fields situated at proximity of head end reaches utilize 4{\%} and 9{\%} extra water than from those placed at middle and tail end reaches, respectively. The inequity of GW abstraction in LBDC command area highlighted in this study requires immediate intervention of policy makers for sustainable GW management.},

abstract = {There are no antivirals to treat viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Since numerous viruses cause URTI, antiviral therapy is impractical. As we have evidence of chloride-ion dependent innate antiviral response in epithelial cells, we conducted a pilot, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) vs standard care on healthy adults within 48 hours of URTI onset to assess recruitment (primary outcome). Acceptability, symptom duration and viral shedding were secondary outcomes. Participants maintained a symptom diary until well for two days or a maximum of 14 days and collected 5 sequential mid-turbinate swabs to measure viral shedding. The intervention arm prepared hypertonic saline and performed HSNIG. We recruited 68 participants (2.6 participants/week; November 2014-March 2015). A participant declined after randomisation. Another was on antibiotics and hence removed (Intervention:32, Control:34). Follow up data was available from 61 (Intervention:30, Control:31). 87{\%} found HSNIG acceptable, 93{\%} thought HSNIG made a difference to their symptoms. In the intervention arm, duration of illness was lower by 1.9 days (p = 0.01), over-the-counter medications (OTCM) use by 36{\%} (p = 0.004), transmission within household contacts by 35{\%} (p = 0.006) and viral shedding by ≥0.5 log10/day (p = 0.04). We hence need a larger trial to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {Nowadays improving the method of design in agriculture using new technologies is a common issue. Irrigation system plays an important role in productivity and some new methods are proposed in this domain. As most of the proposed models are more focused on performance criteria, their obtained design have problems in terms of practicality and feasibility. This paper presents a simulation-optimization model for designing a surface irrigation system. The main innovation of the proposed model is its special focus on the feasibility in real issues. It gives an optimal and feasible surface irrigation system by fuzzy expert systems and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Five fuzzy expert systems analyze the feasibility level of the obtained irrigation system using inference rules which are proposed by expert farmers, and 10 meta-heuristic optimization algorithms optimize the irrigation system based on the fuzzy expert systems outputs. Experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed model. Parameters of 14 fields with different irrigation systems were used in the experiments. The experimental results were re-evaluated by two well-known simulator software programs as SIRMOD and WinSRFR, the obtained results validate the performance of the simulation part of the model. The results of the experiments were compared with the results of three other simulation-optimization models. It was found that the designs presented by the proposed model provide more favorable results in terms of quality, practicality and labor. The designs provided by the proposed model on average reduce labor by 10{\%}, increase practicality by 9{\%} and improve performance by 13{\%}.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDSeveral treatments have been described for hemorrhagic radiation proctitis. The treatment outcomes are variable. Colonic irrigation and oral antibiotics for hemorrhagic radiation proctitis have been recently reported to be a novel and promising therapeutic approach. However, a comparative study of this treatment has never been investigated.OBJECTIVEThis study aimed to compare colonic irrigation and oral antibiotics (irrigation group) versus 4{\%} formalin application (formalin group) for treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis.DESIGNThis was a randomized controlled trial.SETTINGThis study was conducted in a tertiary care/university-based hospital.PATIENTSFifty patients with hemorrhagic radiation proctitis were randomly assigned to each treatment group (n = 25).INTERVENTIONSFor individuals allocated to the irrigation group, daily self-administered colonic irrigation with 1 L of tap water and a 1-week period of oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) were prescribed. For individuals allocated to the formalin group, 4{\%} formalin application for 3 minutes was performed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPatients' symptoms and the endoscopic findings of each group were collected. Patient satisfaction was surveyed. The outcomes were evaluated at 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment.RESULTSThere was a significant improvement in rectal bleeding and bowel frequency in both treatment groups, but significant improvement in urgency, diarrhea, and tenesmus was demonstrated only in the irrigation group. The comparative study between 2 treatments revealed greater improvement in rectal bleeding, urgency, and diarrhea in the irrigation group. Twenty of 24 patients in the irrigation group and 10 of 23 patients in the formalin group were satisfied with the treatment.LIMITATIONSThis trial cannot illustrate whether the antibiotics and the irrigation were equally important because of the limitation of a 2-armed design.CONCLUSIONSThe treatment with colonic irrigation and oral antibiotics appears to be more effective than 4{\%} formalin application for hemorrhagic radiation proctitis treatment and achieves higher patient satisfaction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDMalaria vector sampling is the best method for understanding the vector dynamics and infectivity; thus, disease transmission seasonality can be established. There is a need to protecting humans involved in the sampling of disease vectors during surveillance or in control programmes. In this study, human landing catch, two cow odour baited resting boxes and an unbaited resting box were evaluated as vector sampling tools in an area with a high proportion of Anopheles arabiensis, as the major malaria vector.METHODSThree resting boxes were evaluated against human landing catch. Two were baited with cow odour, while the third was unbaited. The inner parts of the boxes were covered with black cloth materials. Experiments were arranged in latin-square design. Boxes were set in the evening and left undisturbed; mosquitoes were collected at 06:00 am the next morning, while human landing catch was done overnight.RESULTSA total of 9,558 An. arabiensis mosquitoes were collected. 17.5{\%} (N = 1668) were collected in resting box baited with cow body odour, 42.5{\%} (N = 4060) in resting box baited with cow urine, 15.1{\%} (N = 1444) in unbaited resting box and 24.9{\%} (N = 2386) were collected by human landing catch technique. In analysis, the house positions had no effect on the density of mosquitoes caught (DF = 3, F = 0.753, P = 0.387); the sampling technique had significant impact on the caught mosquitoes densities (DF = 3, F 37. 944, P {\textless} 0.001).CONCLUSIONOdour-baited resting boxes have shown the possibility of replacing the existing traditional method (human landing catch) for sampling malaria vectors in areas with a high proportion of An. arabiensis as malaria vectors. Further evaluations of fermented urine and longevity of the urine odour still need to be investigated.},

Knowing the distribution and extent of irrigated areas as well as the amount of water used for irrigation plays a central role in modeling irrigation water requirements and quantifying the impact of irrigation on regional climate, river discharge, and groundwater depletion. Obtaining high-quality global information about irrigation is challenging, especially in terms of quantification of the water actually used for irrigation. Here, we review existing Earth observation datasets, models, and algorithms used for irrigation mapping and quantification from the field to the global scale. The current observation capacities are confronted with the results of a survey on user requirements on satellite-observed irrigation for agricultural water resources' management. Based on this information, we identify current shortcomings of irrigation monitoring capabilities from space and phrase guidelines for potential future satellite missions and observation strategies.},

abstract = {Water shortage has become a major agricultural concern, and "The Sustainable Water Resources Research Program" in Korea is currently addressing this problem through the development of treatment systems for reclaiming wastewater and the assessment of human health risks associated with its reuse. Through this program, started in 2001, many studies have examined various water resources. Reclaiming wastewater is one way to alleviate water-shortage pressures, and one of the major potential uses of reclaimed water is irrigation. However, the main concern with reusing reclaimed wastewater is the increased likelihood of human contact that might result in exposure to pathogens and increased health risks. Relatively few studies have examined the toxic risks using reclaimed wastewater for irrigation in rice paddy fields. This study provides an overview of methods for quantitative microbial risk assessment and toxic risk assessment of heavy metal concentrations developed in the previous studies that can be applied to the evaluation of rice paddy fields irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in South Korea.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Agricultural water management system are subject to a variety of uncertainties and nonlinearity, which complicate the decision-making process and exaggerate water-shortage risks. Previously, few studies could tackle multiple uncertainties and the associated system risks in nonlinear problems. In this paper, a novel risk-averse optimization model was developed for supporting irrigation water management to mitigate these problems. Based on a risk measurement tool, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a CVaR-based interval fuzzy two-stage stochastic quadratic programming (CIFTSQP) was proposed. CIFTSQP could not only provide risk-averse solutions with recourse in response to extreme economic risk quantified as CVaR and water-shortage risk expressed as fuzzy credibility level, but also handle and quantify the nonlinearity in a stochastic program caused by the economy-of-scale effects of facilities. The proposed method has been applied to an irrigation water management case in the northern China. Results suggested that, in response to severe water shortage, sunflowers would be preferred. Meanwhile, groundwater use in Wuyuan County and surface water consumption of Urad Qianqi and Urad Zhongqi should be reduced. Moreover, desired water-allocation strategies with varied risk-aversion levels were generated under different water inflow levels. Results reveal that the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 30 {\%}, 40 {\%} and 70 {\%} under the low, medium and high inflow levels, respectively. Results reveal that higher risks would bring higher returns under the low and medium inflow levels, and the highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 {\%} under the high inflow level.reveal that higher would bring higher returnsunder the low and medium inflow levels, andthe highest economic benefits could be achieved when risk aversion degree reaches 70 {\%} under the high inflow level. The developed CIFTSQP method provided valuable insights into informed irrigation decision-making with respect to economy-of-scale effects, risk aversion and recourse in an agricultural water allocation system. It can also be applied to address other resource allocation problems under uncertainty and risk.},

abstract = {"Significant changes in the agricultural sector in northern Mali suggest that irrigation has made a large contribution to welfare increases over the past eight years. Using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and matched difference in differences with a small panel, this study estimates the impact of access to irrigation on poverty, production, and nutrient intakes. The findings suggest that gains in agricultural production value do not transfer uniquely to household consumption. The paper tests two alternative hypotheses about the distribution of agricultural gains: (1) the gains in agricultural production induced by irrigation yield higher household savings, or (2) intra-village transfers from irrigators to non-irrigators contribute to informal social insurance. The paper provides evidence of both saving and sharing within villages as complimentary strategies for consuming gains in agricultural production. This finding suggests that estimating the effects of a program, relying solely on household consumption, may underestimate the welfare gains of irrigation investment by ignoring the household's savings and informal insurance network." from Author's Abstract},

@phdthesis{Kloezen2002,
abstract = {During the past decade, many countries throughout the world have attempted to improve their generally poor performance record of agency-managed irrigation systems by designing and implementing institutional policy programs. This thesis analyses the institutional viability and the local impact on irrigation performance of two such institutional intervention programs. This is done in the context of the Alto R{\'{i}}o Lerma irrigation district (ARLID), a large-scale irrigation system with a command area of more than 112,000 hectares located in the State of Guanajuato, Central Mexico. The central notion that runs through this study is the recognition that new institutional arrangements do not necessarily follow institutional design principles and top-down directives from policy makers and government interveners, but rather are created in a process of local negotiation between water users, farmer leaders and irrigation managers. This requires detailed observations on local practices, strategies and interactions on how users, leaders and managers cope with building and transforming irrigation institutions.The first intervention program analyzed in this thesis aims to transfer management responsibilities from the irrigation agency (CNA) to local newly established water user organizations (WUAs) and to make them responsible for cost-recovery. The neoliberal belief behind this program is that greater farmer involvement in irrigation management and financing would eventually lead to a reduction in public investments in irrigated agriculture as well as to higher levels of irrigation performance. The second institutional intervention program that is analyzed in this thesis deals with the introduction of water markets, aiming at re-allocating water use to uses of higher economic value. Both intervention programs clearly embark on the 'less state, more market' approach to design and implement institutional arrangements for more use and cost-effective management of scarce resources such as water and funds. The central theme of this thesis is to study how water users and local water managers deal with the problems that result from these interventions and arrangements.In 1992, ARLID was one of the first of Mexican districts were irrigation management transfer (IMT) was introduced. The Mexican IMT program is worldwide considered to be the most successful and ambitious institutional programs in its kind, both because of its scale and the speed with which the policy was designed and implemented. The claims on the successes of these and similar programs are generally ideologically driven, and empirical evidence to support the policy claim that these institutional interventions have achieved these goals remain largely undocumented. This thesis fills some of this empirical void.This thesis comprises ten chapters. After the conceptual and methodological introduction in chapter 1, two contextual chapters follow. Chapter 2 introduces the research site, and chapter 3 presents the political economic history and context in which the institutional interventions took place. Chapter 4 to 9 provide the empirical data from the intensive case study in ARLID. Chapter 10 evaluates the main empirical, conceptual and methodological findings and discusses possible implications for policy and research orientations.The first chapter provides a review of the conceptual approaches and methodologies used to study the viability of new institutional arrangements in the context of market-oriented reforms. This thesis explores the kind of conditions, processes and mechanisms that help to create viable institutions. These mechanisms do not only refer to institutional and economic relationships, but also to the relationship between institutions, and water scarcity and irrigation technology. In that sense the thesis follows the notion that irrigation technology is a sociotechnical phenomenon, with institutional requirements for use.A key concept used for analyzing the viability of new irrigation institutions is accountability. This study shows that four forms of accountability can be separated: operational, financial, political and administrative accountability. Studying these forms of accountability (and the relationship between them ) demonstrates that practices and strategies of decision making in water management are only partly influenced by rational choice and (economic) incentives for utility maximization. They are also influenced by socio-political factors.The methodological concern of this thesis is to develop a set of tools and indicators that help to assess the impacts of institutional interventions, both in terms of changes in irrigation performance levels, and in qualitative terms of processes of institutional viability. Two sets of performance indicators are presented. The first set comprises indicators that measure actual performance against set performance targets. The second set compares performance levels over time and across different system levels. The field work for this thesis comprised a wide set of methods and research techniques, ranging from intensive observations of practices and strategies for coping with the new institutional arrangements, to daily measurements of water flows in two selected WUA areas and several canals and fields in the irrigation district. Field research took place during the period from early 1995 to mid-1998. Chapter 2 provides background information on the location, history, water availability and layout of ARLID. It also introduces the two main groups of farmers that now jointly are organized in the new WUA: ejidatarios and private growers. It shows how these two groups have historically and economically been separated for almost 70 years. The chapter also provides a brief description of the Cortazar and Salvatierra module areas, their canals and WUAs that were selected for the intensive case study.Two important notions form the basis of the chapter 3, in which a detailed description of the historical and political economic context of IMT and water marketing is given. The first notion is that the legitimization for institutional interventions should be viewed in the political economic context of privatizing the Mexican country-side through dramatic constitutional revisions in the way distribution of land and water rights are organized. These reforms and revisions were started in the 1980 as a result of both a political and an economic crisis and were accompanied by wave of programs on the liberalization, decentralization and technocratization of the economy. Institutional intervention programs like the Mexican IMT program do not come on their own, but are preceded, accompanied and followed by other intervention programs that share the same neoliberal legitimization for restructuring the political and economic control over resources. The second notion is that to achieve the economic goals of these neolibral programs, the Salinas and subsequent administrations needed intervention policies such as IMT and water marketing as these would help to recover costs from the users. However, to improve greater involvement of farmers in water management, neoliberal programs are not a necessity.Chapter 4 shows how IMT and water markets were implemented, both at the national level and in ARLID. The IMT program is a typical example of institutional engineering, comprising detailed prescriptions on institutional design and a top-down approach for implementing these designs. Yet, farmers and local managers do not fully disregard these proposed arrangements. Rather than using them as prescriptive dictates, the new principles and arrangements served as a strategic starting point for the WUAs for negotiating irrigation fee levels, water marketing, mode of user representation, maintenance programs, and redistribution of O{\&}M responsibilities between the WUAs and CNA. Local recipients have partly adopted and accommodated the new institutional arrangements. The IMT program allowed local irrigation managers, new leaders of WUAs and farmers to jointly create room and institutional flexibility to alter the proposed arrangements. This was made possible mainly because from the initial stage of implementation, CNA officials in ARLID have shown to users that they are credible and willing to share knowledge and information in a transparent way. Credibility, transparency, institutional flexibility and probity were among the most important factors to explain how operational accountability from CNA to WUAs, and from WUAs to water users, was earned in a continuous process of negotiating institutional arrangements. Furthermore, given the wider set of market-oriented reforms and constitutional revisions that farmers had become familiar with, they realized that they could hardly resist IMT.Chapter 5 provides a detailed analysis of practices, results and operational accountability for local water management. It demonstrates that official post-transfer arrangements for O{\&}M in ARLID do not always reflect actual irrigation practices. As result, outputs of these practices in terms of relative water supply and land and water productivity remained unchanged after IMT. The main reason for this is the conflict in forms of accountability, which could not be resolved under the new institutional arrangements. Rather than adhering to new principles of using water as an economic good, farmers and local managers adhered to pre-IMT arrangements and practices of distributing water. Daily measurements of water flows and observation of irrigation practices revealed that ditch tenders (who are now employed by the WUAs) generally report planned water deliveries rather than actually supplied volumes. In that sense, they continued the practice of being administratively accountable to both users and CNA. This runs counter to the idea of encouraging efficient water use through water pricing and cost-recovery and hence being both financially and operationally accountable. Comparison of water use per hectare or per m 3of water across the 11 module areas in ARLID, shows that although water is the limiting factor in ARLID, the irrigation management strategy chosen by farmers is to maximize returns per hectare rather than increasing returns per m 3of water. As a result, water deliveries per hectare of irrigated land are generally very high. The chapter also provides some evidence that existing irrigation technology and water management regimes do not always match with the institutional capacity of the new WUAs to operate the system. The chapter also explores some ideas of approaching issues of relative water scarcity in the context of conjunctive use and in a wider setting of the entire water basin.Chapter 6 gives a detailed account of how practices, processes and mechanisms of user representation, leadership election and conflict resolution affect political accountability and institutional viability. Detailed analysis of election procedures and processes over a period of two WUA administrations demonstrate that the de jure distribution of farmer representation in the boards and assemblies of WUAs is well organized. However, the de facto control over decision making remains in the hands of a few farmer leaders. These leaders have developed several strategies to reproduce this control. These include political coercion to become re-elected; favoritism in the employment of board members and irrigation staff; corruption; and extending economic and political networks. Particularly in the case of Salvatierra WUA, these strategies have caused that accountability was hardly created. Farmers use two strategies in their trying to counter-balance these mechanisms that weaken accountability. First, they refuse to pay higher fees to signal their dissatisfaction with th WUA's management policies. Second, they call for CNA to resolve disputes over illicit payments and the performance of the WUA leadership.In chapter 7 an analysis is made of how mechanisms of financial accountability influence the institutional viability of the post-transfer institutional arrangements for irrigation management. WUAs in ARLID succeeded to boost cost-recovery and to become financially autonomous. In that sense IMT has been very instrumental to achieving the government goal of reducing public investments in irrigation. However, improved cost-recovery and financial autonomy have also helped WUAs to create room for negotiating the reformulation of important institutional arrangements such as the percentages of total revenue that had to be paid to CNA; the level of water pricing; and the conditions and prices for water trading. Financial transparency, the use of computers and external auditing helped the WUAs to become financially accountable to fee payers. Moreover, particularly in the case of Cortazar, leaders showed that they were credible when they started to use revenues from fee payments to dramatically improve canal maintenance. They also showed their willingness to fire irrigation staff that had proved to be corrupt. Yet, financial viability is threatened in two ways. First, as a result of lack of political accountability (such as in the case of Salvatierra). Second, because of the WUAs' total dependency on water availability to generate income.In chapter 8 the focus of analysis is shifted towards issues of water marketing. WUAs in ARLID indeed have used the now legal opportunity to market water with other WUAs within the district. However, unlike the common belief among neoliberal advocates of water marketing, trading is not used to price water at opportunity cost levels. Rather, the process of water marketing is used to create solidarity among the WUAs. This solidarity is needed to be able to work together in the new federation of WUAs, which has opted to take over from CNA maintenance responsibilities for the main canal system. Water trading is also used by WUAs to show their members that they are credible in the sense that they will try to deliver water at any time; even when they have to buy it from other WUAs during times of water scarcity. As a result, prices of traded water are generally lower than water prices paid for normal water deliveries during times of sufficient water availability.Chapter 9 returns to the official objectives of the IMT program and assesses the program's impact on water management. By applying a set of comparative indicators, it is shown that the result of IMT and water marketing in terms of changes in performance levels are disappointing. With the exception of improvements in cost-recovery and maintenance, there is no evidence that water is used more efficiently or that IMT has resulted in higher levels of productivity per hectare or per m 3of water.Chapter 10 first provides a full synthesis of the empirical findings discussed bove. It subsequently revisits some of the conceptual and methodological tools used for this study. This shows that the conceptual notion of social requirements for use of irrigation technology should be further elaborated to institutional requirements for use. An important notion in this respect is that institutional arrangements are a mixture of formal prescriptive arrangements, existing arrangements and newly negotiated arrangements. Existing and new institutions are the result of a continuous process of creating, negotiating, earning, and maintaining accountability. This explains why institutions manifest themselves as being contingent rather than proposed static structures that follow designed institutional principles.A revisit of the accountability concept shows that it is useful to separate different forms of accountability. This separation helps to analyze accountability mechanisms that go beyond those related to providing mere O{\&}M services or cost-recovery; it also helps to unravel in what way providers of services are accountable, or not; and it helps to recognize in what way different forms of accountability can compete with each other. This is particularly of interest in the case of joint WUA-agency management of irrigation system, where different organizations can have competing management values and targets, and hence try to be accountable in different ways.The methodological revisit on the different sets of impact assessment tools shows that comparative indicators are useful to assess changes over time as a result from institutional interventions. Yet, they are limited in the sense that they exclusively focus on economic and productivity output oriented results. Furthermore, applying these indicators was more time and resource consuming than assumed. The reason for this are the complexity and amount of secondary data needed as well as the difficult process it takes to deconstruct the meaning of these data.This study has several implications for market-oriented policies, both in and outside of Mexico. Because of its unique political economic and constitutional context, the 'Mexican IMT model' cannot simply be copied to other countries where similar attempts of planned institutional changes are underway. Particularly the fact that IMT and water marketing in Mexico were supported by political commitment at the highest levels and by dramatic constitutional revisions and other agrarian reforms, explains why the new institutional arrangements for water management could be speedily implemented on such a wide scale. This study also suggests that institutional 'modernization' programs (such as IMT and water marketing) and physical modernization programs in irrigation should be better matched. Although physical improvement programs are often used to sell institutional reforms (and the consequent burden) to water users, they hardly ever are matched in such a sense that the proposed new technology matches with the proposed new institutional arrangements to use this technology.Chapter 10 ends with a discussion on why to orient research on institutional interventions in water management to the level of entire water basin rather than irrigation systems. Also, irrespective that universities and international research institutes need to do research in the context of a globalizing world and with globalized research agendas, a plea is made to not shift too frequently to doing extensive, quantitative and comparative studies during a short period of time. Understanding institutional change processes and their impacts at the local level requires intensive and qualitative case studies over longer periods of time. Only in this way collaboration with local research partners can fully develop, resulting in the level of creation of institutional research memory that is needed for this understanding.Alternate abstract:Wereldwijd hebben in de afgelopen tien jaar veel landen geprobeerd het slechte functioneren Van de door de overheid beheerde irrigatiestelsels te verbeteren. Dit gebeurde onder andere door middel van het ontwerpen en uitvoeren van institutionele beleidsprogramma's. De institutionele levensvatbaarheid van twee dergelijke interventieprogramma's wordt in dit proefschrift geanalyseerd. Tevens worden hun lokale effecten op het functioneren van een irrigatiestelsel bestudeerd. Dit wordt gedaan binnen de context van het Alto Rio Lerma irrigatiedistrict (ARLID) met een waterbeheergebied van meer dan 112.000 hectaren, gesitueerd in de Staat Guanajuato in Centraal Mexico. Als een rode draad door dit onderzoek loopt de erkenning dat nieuwe institutionele maatregelen niet noodzakelijkerwijs institutionele ontwerpprincipes en top-down instructies van beleidsmakers en -uitvoerders volgen, maar veeleer gecre{\"{e}}erd worden in een lokaal onderhandelingsproces tussen watergebruikers, boerenleiders en irrigatiebeheerders. Dit vereist gedetailleerde observaties van lokale praktijken en interacties tussen gebruikers, leiders en waterbeheerders en hun strategie{\"{e}}n voor het cre{\"{e}}ren en omvormen van irrigatie-instituties. Het eerste interventieprogramma dat in dit proefschrift geanalyseerd wordt heeft als doel beheerverantwoordelijkheden over te dragen van de irrigatiedienst (het CNA) naar pas opgerichte lokale watergebruikersorganisaties (WGO's) en deze tevens verantwoordelijk te maken voor de kostendekking van beheer en onderhoud van irrigatiestelsels. De neoliberale gedachte achter dit programma is dat een toegenomen betrokkenheid van boeren in het beheren en financieren van irrigatiestelsels uiteindelijk zal leiden tot een verlaging van publieke investeringen in de ge{\"{i}}frigeerde landbouw alsmede tot een verbeterd functioneren ven irrigatiestelsels. Het tweede institutionele interventieprogramma dat in dit proefschrift geanalyseerd wordt heeft betrekking op de introductie van watermarkten. Deze heeft als doel om het watergebruik zodanig te herverdelen dat dit leidt tot een gebruik met een hogere economische waarde. Beide interventieprogramma's zijn duidelijk ge{\"{i}}nitieerd vanuit een benadering die 'minder overheid, maar meer markt' voorstaat voor het ontwerpen en implementeren van institutionele maatregelen om te komen tot een meer gebruiks- en kosteneffici{\"{e}}nt beheer van schaarse bronnen als water en geld. Hoe gebruikers en lokale waterbeheerders omgaan met de problemen die het gevolg zijn van deze interventies en maatregelen staat centraal in dit proefschrift. In 1992 was ARLID een van de eerste Mexicaanse irrigatiedistricten waar overdracht van irrigatiebeheer (OIB) werd ge{\"{i}}ntroduceerd. Het Mexicaanse OIB programma wordt wereldwijd gezien als het meest succesvolle en ambitieuze in zijn soort, zowel vanwege de schaal als vanwege de snelheid waarmee het beleid was geformuleerd en uitgevoerd. De succesclaim van deze en vergelijkbare programma's is over het algemeen ideologisch van aard. Empirisch bewijs voor de claim dat deze institutionele interventies de beleidsdoelstellingen hebben bereikt, blijft vooralsnog grotendeels ongedocumenteerd. Dit proefschrift vult voor een deel dit empirische vacu{\"{u}}m. Het proefschrift bevat tien hoofdstukken. Na een conceptuele en methodologische inleiding in hoofdstuk 1 volgen twee contextuele hoofdstukken. In hoofdstuk 2 wordt de onderzoekslocatie ge{\"{i}}ntroduceerd, terwijl in hoofdstuk 3 de politiek-economische geschiedenis en context waarbinnen de institutionele interventies hebben plaatsgevonden worden gepresenteerd. In de hoofdstukken 4 tot en met 9 worden de empirische gegevens uit de intensieve casusstudie die in ARLED verricht is gepresenteerd. In hoofdstuk 10 worden de belangrijkste empirische, conceptuele en methodologische bevindingen ge{\"{e}}valueerd en worden mogelijke implicaties van het onderzoek op beleids- en onderzoeksrichtingen besproken. In het eerste hoofdstuk wordt een overzicht gegeven van de conceptuele benaderingen en methodes die gebruikt zijn om de levensvatbaarheid van nieuwe institutionele maatregelen in de context van marktgerichte hervormingen te bestuderen. In dit proefschrift worden de randvoorwaarden, processen en mechanismen die bijdragen tot het cre{\"{e}}ren van levensvatbare instituties verkend. Deze mechanismen verwijzen niet alleen naar institutionele en economische verhoudingen, maar ook naar relaties tussen deze instituties enerzijds en waterschaarste en irrigatietechnologie anderzijds. Het proefschrift gaat er daarbij vanuit dat irrigatietechnologie een sociaaltechnisch fenomeen is met institutionele gebruikseisen. Een sleutelbegrip voor het analyseren van de levensvatbaarheid van irrigatie-instituties is die van het geven van rekenschap (accountability). Dit onderzoek laat zien dat vier vormen van rekenschap onderscheiden kunnen worden: operationeel, financieel, politiek en ambtelijk. Door deze vormen van rekenschap (en hun onderlinge relatie) te bestuderen, kan worden aangetoond dat de praktijk en de strategie{\"{e}}n om te komen tot besluitvorming in waterbeheer slechts ten dele be{\"{i}}nvloed worden door rationele keuzen en (economische) prikkels voor gebruiksmaximalisatie. Ze worden ook be{\"{i}}nvloed door sociaal-politieke factoren. De methodologische aandacht van dit proefschrift gaat uit naar de ontwikkeling van een groep instrumenten en indicatoren waarmee de effecten van institutionele interventies bepaald kunnen worden, zowel in termen van verandering in het functioneringsniveau (performance levels) van irrigatiestelsels, als in kwalitatieve termen van institutionele levensvatbaarheidsprocessen. Twee groepen van functioneringsindicatoren worden gepresenteerd. De eerste groep bevat indicatoren waarmee het daadwerkelijke functioneren wordt gemeten in relatie tot voorgeschreven functioneringsdoelstellingen. Met de tweede groep indicatoren worden functioneringsniveaus door de tijd en met andere systeemniveaus onderling vergeleken. Voor het veldwerk zijn een scala aan methodes en onderzoekstechnieken gebruikt, vari{\"{e}}rend van intensieve observaties van praktijken en strategie{\"{e}}n die gebruikt worden voor het omgaan met nieuwe institutionele maatregelen, tot het dagelijks meten van waterstromen en volumes in twee geselecteerde WGO-gebieden en enkele kanalen en velden binnen het irrigatiedistrict. Het veldwerk heeft van begin 1995 tot halverwege 1998 plaatsgevonden. In hoofdstuk 2 wordt informatie gegeven over de locatie, de geschiedenis, de beschikbaarheid van water en het fysische ontwerp van ARLID. Daarnaast worden de twee groepen van boeren die nu gezamenlijk binnen de nieuwe WGO's zijn georganiseerd ge{\"{i}}ntroduceerd: de ejidatarios en particuliere landbouwers. Het laat zien hoe deze twee groepen gedurende bijna 70 jaar historisch en economisch gescheiden zijn geweest. In het hoofdstuk wordt ook een korte beschrijving gegeven van de twee voor de intensieve casusstudie geselecteerde WGO-gebieden, met hun kanalen en hun organisaties. Twee uitgangspunten vormen de basis van hoofdstuk 3, waarin een gedetailleerde beschrijving wordt gegeven van de historische en politiek-economische context van OIB en hei; vermarkten van water. Het eerste uitgangspunt is dat de legitimatie voor institutionele interventies bekeken zou moeten worden in het licht van de politiek-economische context van de privatisering van het Mexicaanse platteland. Deze privatisering kwam tot stand middels een drastische constitutionele herziening van de wijze waarop land- en waterrechten zijn verdeeld. Deze hervormingen en herzieningen kwamen in de jaren 80 op gang als een gevolg van zowel een politieke als een economische crisis. Ze werden begeleid door een golf van programma's die zich richtten op de liberalisering, decentralisering en technocratisering van de economie. Institutionele interventieprogramma's, zoals het Mexicaanse OD3 programma, komen niet vanzelf maar worden vooraf gegaan, begeleid en gevolgd door andere interventieprogramma's die dezelfde neoliberale legitimatie hanteren voor het willen herstructureren van de politieke en economische controle over (natuurlijke en financi{\"{e}}le) hulpbronnen. Het tweede uitgangspunt is dat de Salinas (en de daarop volgende) regering een interventiebeleid zoals OIB en het vermarkten van water nodig had om de economische doelstellingen van hun neoliberale programma's te bereiken. Dit beleid zou helpen om de kosten op de gebruikers te verhalen. Neoliberale programma's zijn echter niet per se noodzakelijk om meer betrokkenheid van de boeren in waterbeheer te kunnen bewerkstelligen. Hoofdstuk 4 laat zien hoe het beleid van OIB en het vermarkten van water werden ge{\"{i}}mplementeerd, zowel nationaal als op het niveau van ARLID. Het OIB programma is een typisch voorbeeld van institutioneel ontwerpen. Dit programma bestaat uit zowel gedetailleerde voorschriften over hoe het institutionele ontwerp eruit moet zien als uit een top-down benadering voor het uitvoeren van deze ontwerpen. Toch hebben boeren en lokale waterbeheerders deze voorgestelde maatregelen niet volledig naast zich neergelegd. In plaats van ze als voorgeschreven instructies te gebruiken, hebben de WGO's deze nieuwe principes en maatregelen gebruikt als een strategisch vertrekpunt voor hun onderhandelingen over onder andere de hoogte van de irrigatietarieven, het vermarkten van water, de wijze van vertegenwoordiging door gebruikers, de onderhoudprogramma's, en de herverdeling van verantwoordelijken voor beheer en onderhoud tussen WGO's en het CNA. De nieuwe institutionele maatregelen zijn gedeeltelijk door de lokale ontvangers geadopteerd en op hun situatie aangepast. Het OIB programma stond toe dat lokale irrigatiebeheerders, nieuwe leiders van WGO's en boeren gezamenlijk ruimte en institutionele flexibiliteit konden cre{\"{e}}ren om de voorgestelde maatregelen aan te kunnen passen. Dit werd hoofdzakelijk mogelijk gemaakt door CNA-fimctionarissen in ARLID, die vanaf het begin van de uitvoering van OIB aan gebruikers lieten zien dat zij geloofwaardig waren en tevens bereid om hun kennis en informatie op een transparante manier met de boeren te delen. Tijdens het onderhandelingsproces over de vorming van institutionele maatregelen zijn geloofwaardigheid, transparantie, institutionele flexibiliteit en eerlijkheid bepalend geweest voor operationeel rekenschap (operational accountability) tussen zowel het CNA en de WGO's als tussen de WGO's en de watergebruikers. Gezien het brede scala aan marktgerichte hervormingen en constitutionele herzieningen waarmee de boeren inmiddels bekend waren geworden, realiseerden zij zich dat zij nauwelijks weerstand zouden kunnen bieden aan OIB. Hoofdstuk 5 geeft een gedetailleerde analyse van de praktijken, de resultaten en van de mechanismen van het verlenen van operationeel rekenschap binnen lokaal waterbeheer. Het laat zien dat in ARLID na beheeroverdracht de offici{\"{e}}le maatregelen voor beheer en onderhoud niet altijd overeenstemden met de daadwerkelijke irrigatiepraktijk. Het gevolg hiervan was dat de resultaten van deze praktijk in termen van relatieve watertoedeling (RWS) en land- en waterproductiveit ook na OIB onveranderd bleven. Het conflict tussen de verschillende vormen van het afleggen van rekenschap was hiervan de belangrijkste oorzaak. Dit kon niet opgelost worden binnen het palet van nieuwe institutionele maatregelen. In plaats van vast te houden aan het nieuwe principe om water te gebruiken als ware het een economisch goed, hielden boeren en lokale waterbeheerders vast aan het verdelen en gebruiken van water zoals dit reeds gebeurde onder de maatregelen van v{\'{o}}{\'{o}}r de beheeroverdracht. Het dagelijks meten van waterstromen en volumes, alsmede de dagelijkse observaties van irrigatiepraktijken hebben laten zien dat waterverdelers (die nu rechtstreeks in dienst zijn van de WGO's) over het algemeen de geplande in plaats van de daadwerkelijke volumes van watertoedeling rapporteren aan de WGO's. Op deze wijze zetten zij de praktijk van het afleggen van ambtelijk rekenschap {\{}administrative accountability) aan zowel gebruikers als CNA voort. Dit strookt niet met het idee dat effici{\"{e}}nt watergebruik gestimuleerd wordt door gebruikers te laten betalen voor het water (waarmee financieel en operationeel rekenschap afgedwongen zou worden). De vergelijking van de productiviteit per hectare of per m3 water tussen de 11 WGO-gebieden binnen ARLID laat zien dat ondanks dat water de limiterende factor is, de door de boeren gekozen waterbeheerstrategie gericht was op het maximaliseren van de opbrengst per hectare in plaats van verhogen van de opbrengst per m 3 water. Dit had als gevolg dat de waterverstrekkingen per ge{\"{i}}rrigeerde hectare over het algemeen erg hoog waren. In dit hoofdstuk wordt ook het bewijs geleverd dat de bestaande irrigatietechnologie en het waterbeheerregiem niet altijd aansluiten bij de institutionele capaciteit van de nieuwe WGO's om het stelsel te beheren. Het hoofdstuk verkent ook enkele idee{\"{e}}n over hoe kwesties met betrekking tot relatieve waterschaarste in de context van zowel gelijktijdig grond- en oppervlaktewatergebruik als het gehele stroomgebied benaderd kunnen worden. Hoofdstuk 6 geeft een uitgebreid verslag van de praktijk, de processen en de mechanismen van gebruikersvertegenwoordiging, de verkiezingen van WGO-leiders en van conflictoplossing, en hoe deze de politieke rekenschap en de institutionele levensvatbaarheid van instituties be{\"{i}}nvloeden. Een gedetailleerde analyse van verkiezingsprocedures en processen gedurende twee zittingsperiodes van WGO's laat zien dat de de jure verdeling van boerenvertegenwoordiging in het bestuur en de vergadering van de WGO's goed georganiseerd was. Echter, de de facto controle over besluitvorming bleef in handen van enkele boerenleiders. Deze leiders hebben verschillenden strategie{\"{e}}n ontwikkeld om deze controle te reproduceren. Deze omvatten onder andere het uitoefenen van politieke dwang om herkozen te worden, corruptie, en het uitbreiden van economische en politieke netwerken. Vooral in het geval van WGO Salvatierra hebben deze strategie{\"{e}}n er toe bijgedragen dat mechanismen voor het afleggen van rekenschap nauwelijks gecre{\"{e}}erd zijn. Watergebuikers hanteren twee belangrijke strategie{\"{e}}n in hun poging om tegenwicht te vormen tegen afnemend rekenschap. Ten eerste weigeren ze de hogere watertarieven te betalen. Hiermee geven ze een signaal af over hun onvrede met het managementbeleid van de WGO's. Ten tweede vragen ze het CNA hen te helpen met het oplossen van conflicten die ontstaan zijn als gevolg van zowel onrechtmatige betalingen als het slechte functioneren van WGO-leiders. In hoofdstuk 7 wordt een analyse gemaakt van hoe na beheeroverdracht mechanismen van het afleggen van financi{\"{e}}le rekenschap de institutionele levensvatbaarheid van de maatregelen ten behoeve van irrigatiebeheer be{\"{i}}nvloeden. WGO's in ARLID zijn er in geslaagd om de kosten van waterbeheer veel meer op de gebruikers te verhalen en om financieel autonoom te worden. Vanuit dat oogpunt is OIB zeer instrumenteel gebleken voor het bereiken van de overheidsdoelstelling om publieke investeringen in de irrigatiesector te verminderen. Echter, het beter verhalen van de kosten op de gebruiker en het tot stand brengen van financi{\"{e}}le autonomie hebben er ook toe bijgedragen dat de WGO's ruimte konden cre{\"{e}}ren om de herziening van belangrijke maatregelen verder uit te onderhandelen. Dit betrof onder andere het percentage van het totale inkomen van een WGO dat aan het CNA betaald moest worden, de hoogte van de watertarieven, en de voorwaarden voor het mogen handelen in water en de prijzen die voor dit water betaald moesten worden. Financi{\"{e}}le transparantie, het gebruik van computers en het inhuren van externe accountants hebben er toe bijgedragen dat de WGO's financieel rekenschap konden afleggen naar gebruikers die voor hun water betaald hadden. Vooral in het geval van WGO Cort{\'{a}}zar hebben leiders bovendien laten zien dat ze geloofwaardig waren door het inkomen uit watertarieven te gebruiken voor ht:t aanzienlijk verbeteren van de staat van onderhoud van de kanalen. Ze hebben ook laten zisn bereid te zijn irrigatierunctionarissen te ontslaan toen bleek dat deze corrupt waren. Toch wordt de financi{\"{e}}le levensvatbaarheid van de WGO's op twee manieren bedreigd. Op de eerste plaats is dit een gevolg van het gebrek aan politieke verantwoording (zoals in het geval v{\pounds}un Salvatierra). In de tweede plaats komt dit voort uit een volkomen afhankelijkheid van de beschikbaarheid van water voor het genereren van inkomen voor de WGO. In hoofdstuk 8 verschuift de aandacht naar de analyse van het vermarkten van water. WGO's in ARLID hebben daadwerkelijk de nu legale mogelijkheid aangegrepen om water te vermarkten aan andere WGO's binnen hetzelfde irrigatiedistrict. Echter, in tegenstelling tot de gebruikelijke opvatting van neoliberale voorstanders van watermarkten, zien de WGO's het hiindelen in water niet als een mogelijkheid om de waterprijs op het niveau van opportunity kosten te krijgen. In plaats daarvan wordt het proces van het vermarkten van water gebruikt om solidariteit tussen de WGO's te cre{\"{e}}ren. Deze solidariteit is noodzakelijk om te kunnen samenwerken in de nieuwe federatie van WGO's, die er voor gekozen heeft om de v{\'{i}}{\'{i}}rantwoordelijkheden voor het onderhoud van het hoofdkanaal van het CNA over te nemen. WGO's gebruiken waterhandel ook om aan hun leden te laten zien dat ze geloofwaardig zijn door te trachten te allen tijde water te leveren, zelfs indien ze gedurende perioden van waterschaarste water moeten kopen van andere WGO's. Als een gevolg hiervan zijn de prijzen van verhandeld water over het algemeen lager dan de prijs die betaald moet worden voor normale waterverstrekkingen gedurende periodes met voldoende waterbeschikbaarheid. In hoofdstuk 9 wordt teruggekeerd naar de offici{\"{e}}le doelstellingen van het OD3 programma. Dit gebeurt door de effecten van dit programma op het waterbeheer te bekijken. Met behulp van vergelijkende indicatoren wordt aangetoond dat de effecten van OIB en het vermarkten van water op het functioneren van het waterbeheer teleurstellend zijn. Met uitzondering van verbeteringen in het verhalen van de kosten op de gebruikers en in het onderhoud van het stelsel is er geen bewijs dat OIB geresulteerd heeft in effici{\"{e}}nter watergebruik noch in productiviteitsstijgingen per hectare of per m3 water. Hoofdstuk 10 geeft eerst een volledige synthese van de hierboven besproken empirische bevindingen. Vervolgens worden enkele conceptuele begrippen en methodologische middelen die gebruikt zijn tijdens dit onderzoek opnieuw onder de loep genomen. Dit laat zien dat het conceptuele uitgangspunt van sociale gebruikseisen voor irrigatietechnologie verder ontwikkeld zou moeten worden tot het begrip van institutionele gebruikseisen. Een belangrijke constatering hierbij is dat institutionele maatregelen een verzameling zijn van formele voorschriften, van bestaande maatregelen en van opnieuw onderhandelde maatregelen. Bestaande en nieuwe instituties zijn het resultaat van een continu proces waarin het afleggen van rekenschap gecre{\"{e}}erd, onderhandeld, verdiend en onderhouden wordt. Dit verklaart waarom instituties 'toevallig' {\{}contingent) lijken in plaats van voorbedachte statische structuren gebaseerd op institutionele ontwerpprincipes. Het opnieuw bekijken van het begrip rekenschap (accountability) laat zien dat het zinvol is om verschillende vormen van rekenschap te onderscheiden. Naast het analyseren van rekenschapmechanismen die betrekking hebben op het enkel leveren van beheer- en onderhoudsdiensten, of op het verhalen van kosten op gebruikers, helpt het maken van dit onderscheid juist ook andere mechanismen van rekenschap te analyseren. Het helpt ook bij het ontrafelen van de wijzen waarop dienstenleveranciers al dan niet rekenschap afleggen. Tevens helpt het om te laten zien op wat voor manier verschillende vormen van rekenschap a{\~{n}}eggen elkaar kunnen beconcurreren. Dit is vooral van belang in het geval van gezamenlijk beheer van irrigatiestelsels door WGO's en overheidsdiensten. Omdat deze organisaties 289 SAMENVATTING verschillende waarden en doelen kunnen hebben zullen zij op verschillende manieren trachten rekenschap af te leggen. Een evaluatie van de verschillende groepen methoden voor het bepalen van effecten van institutionele interventies laat zien dat de vergelijkende indicatoren bruikbaar zijn voor het bepalen van veranderingen die het gevolg zijn van deze interventies. Hun bruikbaarheid wordt echter beperkt door het feit dat ze zich met name richten op het meten van veranderingen in productiviteit en op economische effecten. Bovendien bleek het toepassen van deze indicatoren meer tijd en middelen te vergen dan was aangenomen. De reden hiervan moet gezocht worden in de complexiteit en de hoeveelheid van de benodigde secundaire data alsmede in het moeilijke proces van het ontsluiten van de betekenis van deze data. Dit onderzoek heeft verschillende implicaties voor marktgericht beleid in zowel Mexico als daarbuiten. Vanwege zijn unieke politiek-economische en constitutionele context is het niet mogelijk om het 'Mexicaanse OIB model' zomaar te kopi{\"{e}}ren naar andere landen waar vergelijkbare pogingen van geplande institutionele veranderingen reeds gaande zijn. Zowel vanwege het feit dat OIB en het vermarkten van water door het allerhoogste politieke niveau werden gesteund als vanwege de drastische constitutionele herzieningen en andere landbouwhervormingen konden de nieuwe institutionele maatregelen voor waterbeheer in zo'n korte tijd en op zo'n grote schaal worden uitgevoerd. Dit onderzoek wijst er ook op dat institutionele moderniseringsprogramma's (zoals OIB en het vermarkten van water) en infrastructurele modernisering veel beter op elkaar aan moeten sluiten. Ondanks het feit dat infrastructurele verbeteringsprogramma's vaak gebruikt worden om institutionele hervormingen (en de lasten die daar bij horen) aan de watergebruikers te verkopen, worden ze nauwelijks aan elkaar gerelateerd op een manier waarop de voorgestelde nieuwe technologie aansluit bij de nieuwe institutionele maatregelen die nodig zijn om deze technologie te kunnen gebruiken. Hoofdstuk 10 eindigt met een discussie over de vraag waarom onderzoek naar institutionele interventies zich meer moet richten op het stroomgebiedniveau in plaats van op het niveau van irrigatiestelsels. Daarnaast wordt er een pleidooi gehouden om de onderzoeksaandacht niet al te frequent te verleggen naar het doen van korte, extensieve, kwantitatieve en vergelijkende studies, ondanks het feit dat universiteiten en internationale onderzoeksinstituten gedwongen zijn onderzoek te doen in de context van een geglobaliseerde wereld met geglobaliseerde onderzoeksagenda's. Voor het begrijpen van institutionele veranderingsprocessen en de effecten daarvan op lokaal niveau zijn langdurige, intensieve en kwalitatieve casusstudies vereist. Alleen op die manier kan samenwerking met lokale onderzoekspartners volledig ontwikkeld worden. Dit zal uiteindelijk tot gevolg hebben dat de voor een dergelijk begrip noodzakelijk institutioneel onderzoeksgeheugen gecre{\"{e}}erd wordt.}}},

Irrigation infrastructure creates migration barriers which can block access to important nursery, feeding and spawning habitat. Lao PDR is a landlocked country situated within the Lower Mekong River Basin where there is a substantial dependency on rice and fish for food, income and livelihoods. The country is experiencing an unprecedented boom in irrigation infrastructure investment, with modernisation programs being implemented in every province. Despite significant investment in infrastructure upgrades, and the potential impact on freshwater fish, little consideration has been given to fish passage solutions. In 2008, we commenced a fish passage program in Lao PDR.

abstract = {Salinity and waterlogging have impacted agricultural production in arid areas for more than 2000 years. The causes of the problems are well known, as are the methods and investments required to manage salt-affected soils and shallow water tables. Yet the problems persist in many regions where farmers apply excessive irrigation water, and where farmers and irrigation departments fail to invest in adequate drainage solutions. Long ago, Professor E.W. Hilgard described the inevitability of salinity problems in arid areas and the measures required to prevent or overcome those problems. Hilgard warned of impending salinization in California's Central Valley, based partly on his understanding of salinity and waterlogging problems in India. More recently, Jan van Schilfgaarde, Jim Oster, and others also have described the inevitable environmental impacts of irrigation. These authors suggest that irrigation likely can be sustained, but the cost of reducing the environmental impacts to an acceptable level might be substantial in some areas. We review the perspectives of these authors, and others, with an outlook toward a future in which the goal of achieving sustainable irrigation coincides with the goal of intensifying agriculture more generally, to provide food and fiber for an expanding global population. We propose five activities that might be implemented in a comprehensive program to achieve successful management of salinity and waterlogging. We also introduce the notion of implementing a deposit or bond payment for the salt contained in irrigation water deliveries. Farmers would be reimbursed in accordance with their salt management and disposal practices.},

abstract = {Climate change poses great challenges for food security and water use. This study aimed to investigate the response of winter wheat in Northern China to climate change and propose corresponding strategies to maintain yield and crop water productivity (WPc). Climate model projections from the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used to drive the process-based soil–water–atmosphere–plant (SWAP) agro-hydrological model. The SWAP parameters were optimized by the Parameter Estimation program (PEST), which extended the crop model to the regional scale. SWAP was used to simulate responses of crop growth, evapotranspiration (ET), and yield to baseline (2006–2012) climate and two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for future climate conditions. The results indicated that PEST had high optimization efficiency and calibrated SWAP performed well (average relative error {\textless} 20.87 {\%} and normalized root mean square error {\textless} 25.83 {\%}). Compared with baseline, the maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) by 6.47°C and 8.59°C, respectively. The cumulative precipitation during the growing season increased by 303.22–316.12 mm. Warming significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced the growth period of winter wheat by 25.3–34.7 days, especially in the emergence–heading stage. Path analysis revealed that significant (P {\textless} 0.05) change of precipitation was a determining factor in increasing ET. The adverse effect of temperature increase offset the promotion of yield due to radiation, and ultimately led to a yield reduction of 35.57–41.14 {\%}. The optimization scenario indicated that late-maturing varieties and irrigation adjustment could improve yield (up to 38.21 {\%}) and WPc (up to 44.30 {\%}) under future climate conditions. Implementing irrigation at an early growing stage (joining and heading) was beneficial to increase yield and WPc. We recommend combining late-maturing varieties with irrigation adjustments to maintain yield and WPc under future climate conditions.},

abstract = {The Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS), in Central China, has drawn attention internationally because it managed to sustain its rice production in the face of a dramatic reallocation of water to cities, industries and hydropower uses. Ponds, the small reservoirs ubiquitous in the area, are hypothesized to have been instrumental in this. Ponds are recharged by a combination of return flows from irrigation and runoff from catchment areas within the irrigated perimeter. They provide a flexible, local source of irrigation water to farmers. This paper assesses the storage capacity and some key hydrological properties of ponds in a major canal command within ZIS. Using remote sensing data (Landsat and IKONOS) and an area-volume relationship based on a field survey, we obtained an overall pond storage capacity of 96mm (per unit irrigated area). A comparative analysis between 1978 and 2001 reveals that part of this capacity results from a very significant development of ponds (particularly in the smaller range of sizes) in the time interval, probably as a response to rapidly declining canal supplies. We developed a high-resolution digital elevation model from 1:10,000 topographic maps to support a GIS-based hydrological analysis. Pond catchments were delineated and found to extensively overlap, forming hydrological cascades of up to 15 units. In a 76-km super(2) area within the irrigation system, we found an average of close to five 'connected' ponds downstream of each irrigated pixel. This high level of connectivity provides opportunities for multiple reuses of water as it flows along toposequences. A fundamental implication is that field 'losses' such as seepage and percolation do not necessarily represent losses at a larger scale. Such scale effects need to be adequately taken into account to avoid making wrong assumptions about water-saving interventions in irrigation.},

In particular, in water scarce regions such as the Mediterranean, water supply is expected to become more uncertain because of climate change. Consequently, pro-active policy initiatives are proposed to increase supply reliability. Local context is important when the effectiveness of policies is assessed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate farmers' acceptance of policy strategies to increase water supply reliability in the Segura, a water scarce river basin in the south-east of Spain. Results from a choice experiment suggest that farmers are willing to pay twice as much as their current irrigation water price to ensure water supply reliability through government supply guaranteed programs. However, they are averse to any institutional changes that might assist the government to achieve increased water supply.},

abstract = {The potential of smallholder-irrigated agriculture to enhance food security and improve livelihoods has led the government of Ethiopia to invest significantly in irrigation establishment. This article aims to investigate the impact of small-scale irrigation on households' livelihood. To deal with the problems of purposive targeting and self-selection which are likely to occur for this type of intervention, we use a sophisticated econometric technique called ‘propensity score matching' to study this impact. Our findings confirm the presence of a statistically significant difference in income, overall expenditure, asset accumulation and expenditures on agricultural inputs between the treated and control households. In contrast, no statistically significant differences in livestock resources, food consumption, and expenditure on education and health were found. Furthermore, the proportion of poor is respectively 20 and 30{\%} for the treated and control households. So, overall it can be concluded that participation in the small-scale irrigation has robust and positive effect on most of the livelihood indices and that an expansion of irrigation schemes is a good strategy in the water-stressed and drought-prone areas of Ethiopia},

In this study, we analyze the adoption of small-scale irrigation technologies (SSITs) and its impact on land productivity using cross-sectional data from a sample of 360 farmers in Rwanda. The study uses the propensity score matching technique to address potential self-selection bias. Our results reveal that adoption decisions are significantly influenced by factors such as education, farm size, group membership, gender, extension services, access to credit, access to weather forecast information, risk perceptions, access to a reliable source of water for irrigation, awareness of rainwater harvesting techniques, and awareness of subsidy programs. In addition, the results show that the adoption of SSITs has a significantly positive impact on land productivity. The study concludes with policy implications that highlight the need to promote the adoption of SSITs among farmers as a strategy to improve agricultural productivity and food security in Rwanda.},

abstract = {The management of water resources by orchards in the south-eastern region of Australia is an increasingly important policy issue, especially given the low water allocations and concerns about salinity in recent years. Optimal management for economic and environmental sustainability can be described as best management practice (BMP). A project was developed to run an extension program, which aimed to achieve behavioural change among orchardists through the adoption of irrigation BMPs and benchmarks. The effectiveness of the extension program was evaluated and the drivers for adoption assessed. In the first stage of the project both BMPs and benchmarks were determined for irrigation management. A survey of 200 growers showed no relationship between yield and irrigation system or irrigation volume suggesting that increased yields were not a key driver for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices. Stage two of the project involved undertaking an extension program aimed to facilitate the adoption of BMPs and benchmarks and incorporated a suite of activities to meet the learning needs of a diversity of participants (40 growers). The program was effective in establishing behavioural change for many of the growers involved; however, it was resource intensive requiring significant one-on-one input. Stage three aimed to analyse the key drivers for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices for the whole of the stone and pome fruit industry in south-eastern Australia using market research. The study determined that water use efficiency was not a key driver for adoption of sustainable irrigation practices (micro irrigation and soil moisture monitoring) and adoption was generally not limited by lack of knowledge. Groups of growers were identified where extension programs could be effective by focussing on specific information e.g. redevelopment of orchard. Other groups had no need and/or ability to change unless the external operating environment was to change e.g. regulation, access to pressurised water. The voluntary adoption of more sustainable irrigation practices will probably require extensive resources using one-on-one methodology. The extension program should not focus on the broader social objective of improved water use efficiency but promote other potential benefits (e.g. labour saving, redevelopment of production systems, management flexibility) with targeted messages for specific groups.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an intensifying focus on the development of irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. It follows a 20-year hiatus in the wake of disappointing irrigation performance during the 1970s and 1980s. Persistent low productivity in African agriculture and vulnerability of African food supplies to increasing instability in international commodity markets are driving pan-African agricultural investment initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), that identify as a priority the improvement in reliability of water control for agriculture. The paper argues that, for such initiatives to be effective, there needs to be a re-appraisal of current dynamics of irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly with respect to the role of small-scale producers' initiatives in expanding irrigation. The paper reviews the principal forms such initiatives take and argues that official narratives and statistics on African irrigation often underestimate the extent of such activities. The paper identifies five key characteristics which, it argues, contradict widely held assumptions that inform irrigation policy in Africa. The paper concludes by offering a definition of 'farmer-led irrigation' that embraces a range of interaction between producers and commercial, government and non-government agencies, and identifies priority areas for research on the growth potential and impact of such interactions and strategies for their future development.},

abstract = {Agricultural water markets play a crucial role in arid and semi-arid regions by reallocating water and transferring it from low-value uses to high-value uses. Several markets for surface water and groundwater are functioning all over the world to increase economic well-being of farmers and meet environmental flow requirements. However, there is not a consensus on precisely which market mechanism may be more environmentally and economically beneficial. This study presents an agent-based groundwater market model to analyze the economic and hydrologic impacts of three market mechanisms, designed based on the cap-and-trade scheme, that differ in the price discovery process, two of which are uniform price double-auction and the third is a discriminatory price double-auction. This study also analyzes the hydrologic and economic impacts of water buyback programs. Modeling results, applied to Rafsanjan Plain, an arid region in Iran, show that the discriminatory price double-auction is the most hydrologically and economically advantageous mechanism since it reduces the annual water level drawdown by 38 {\%} and brings about more profits for farmers in comparison with other market mechanisms. Furthermore, the buyback program effectively reduces the inequality of wealth distribution (Gini Index) and increases farmers' net benefit while reducing their surplus.},

abstract = {Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5.6 {\%} and larger beans by 6.25 {\%}. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20 {\%}. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.},

abstract = {Sustainable agricultural development, in arid and semi-arid region is influenced to a great extent by sources of water that might be used economically and effectively in developing agriculture programs. Therefore, the use of treated municipal wastewater, as a new source for water irrigation, has been encouraged by Saudi government to increase the efficient use of water irrigation in crop production. Thus, the present investigation was carried out in field trials in split-split plot design, during two successive seasons of 2005/2006 and 2006/2007, in Agriculture Research Station, Faculty of Food and Agriculture sciences, King Saud University, near Riyadh. The main objective of the current work is to study the effect of two water resources, i.e.; treated wastewater and brackish water on the yield and quality of two wheat genotypes under Saudi Arabia environment. Data included preharvest parameters, yield component and yield characters and grain quality estimated as protein and micronutrient heavy metal contents of two wheat genotypes. Results obtained clearly obvious that, irrigation with secondary treated wastewater was preferable for plant growth, yield component characters and grain yield. Moreover, grain quality as protein content was increased by using treated wastewater in irrigation compared with underground water. Micronutrient, heavy metal concentration was very small and is of no concern to crop quality or animal and human dietary intake. Finally, Keeping in view of the above mentioned results, show we can concluded that the treated wastewater throw the light on untraditional sources of water which can be safely used in improving agricultural programs under arid and semiarid regions.},

abstract = {The crop management practice of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is being promoted by IRRI and the national research and extension program in Bangladesh and other parts of the world as a water-saving irrigation practice that reduces the environmental impact of dry season rice production through decreased water usage, and potentially increases yield. Evidence is growing that AWD will dramatically reduce the concentration of arsenic in harvested rice grains conferring a third major advantage over permanently flooded dry season rice production. AWD may also increase the concentration of essential dietary micronutrients in the grain. However, three crucial aspects of AWD irrigation require further investigation. First, why is yield generally altered in AWD? Second, is AWD sustainable economically (viability of farmers' livelihoods) and environmentally (aquifer water table heights) over long-term use? Third, are current cultivars optimized for this irrigation system? This paper describes a multidisciplinary research project that could be conceived which would answer these questions by combining advanced soil biogeochemistry with crop physiology, genomics, and systems biology. The description attempts to show how the breakthroughs in next generation sequencing could be exploited to better utilize local collections of germplasm and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying biological adaptation to the environment within the context of soil chemistry and plant physiology.

abstract = {Purpose - The Suez Irrigation Canal is the source of drinking water to a large community. Complaints have been raised regarding the odor and unpleasant taste of drinking water. The problems encountered reveled enrichment of the Canal with nutrients, degraded water quality and nuisance caused by algal growth. This paper aims to investigate these claims by evaluating the interaction between water and sediment with ecological indicators. Design/methodology/approach - Bioassessments were used as a primary tool to evaluate the biological conditions and identify the degree of water quality degradation in the Suez Irrigation Canal. The monitoring program integrates biological, chemical, and physical data assessment Several field surveys were carried out to these areas during the period between March 2003 and February 2005 (over 23 months) for acquiring all possible information about the current situation and to explore the impact of human activities along the canal banks on the canal ecosystem. Seasonal variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton standing crop, species diversity as well as physico-chemical characteristics of water, sediment, fish and aquatic weeds at the intakes of drinking plants and from the discharge of agricultural and domestic drains into the Canal were investigated. Findings - Preliminary field investigations showed great amounts of discharged wastes at several locations to the canal water creating unique conditions, which vary with changes of volume and properties of the discharged wastes. Rotifer and green algae for example demonstrated seasonal variable response to the ecological variations. Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamageton nodsus and Polygonum Salicfolium were the most common types of recorded weed. The Myriophyllum spicatum is the dominant submerged plant The canal was characterized by high concentrations of HCO super(-) sub(3) as well as high pH {\textgreater} 8.2 which provides a favorable habitat for the growth of Myriophyllum spicatum. The results illustrated the ability of using the aquatic weed as biomarkers for monitoring heavy metals contaminates in the canal. The evidence suggests that there is a degree of selectivity in metals uptake and partitioning within the plant compartments. Originality/value - The current paper adopts the idea of utilizing multiple organism groups in the bioassessment to effectively detect ecological change when they occur in one of the most important waterways in Egypt These different organism groups are suited for detection various stressors, providing warnings and detection of stress impacts at different scales. The study presented provides decision makers with important information that can assist them in making objective decisions related to the design of monitoring programs based on scientific research.},

This paper presents an analysis of water demand for agricultural areas from Periam locality using one program developed by FAO: CropWat 8.0. CropWat 8.0 allows the users to calculate crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil, climate and crop data. They can also use this program to develop irrigation schedules for different management conditions. This program can also be used for the calculation of scheme water supply for varying crop patterns and to evaluate farmers' irrigation practices and to estimate crop performance under both rainfed and irrigated conditions.},

abstract = {The reuse of treated wastewater is considered necessary but also effective solution in water-scarce areas of the world for the confrontation of increased water demand due to increasing population and per capita consumption. The application of treated wastewater reuse presupposes right planning based on the protection of public health and environment according to enacted specifications of wastewater treatment plant effluent quality and also gaining public acceptance. The guidelines in the USA vary from state to state. The guidelines of the State of California set more stringent criteria than those of WHO, but they are not the strictest in the world. In European level does not exist legislative regulation with regard to the reuse of treated wastewater and each country applies national or even regional directives. Therefore, it is necessary for European Union countries to legislate a directive for the encouragement but also the safe application of wastewater reuse programs. In this work, the main worldwide regulatory status for microbiological quality criteria is presented, that is applied in programs for wastewater reuse in agricultural irrigation.},

abstract = {Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) that depend on foreign aid once political independence is gained, continue to be affected by changing aid modalities led by aid communities. It has been claimed that previous irrigation programs in SSA have not improved agricultural production as expected, and that the budget for implementation of further irrigation development has then been decreased. As a result, small-scale operations, which are part of participatory integrated rural development (PIRD), have become mainstream in the implementation of irrigation development in SSA. A small-scale irrigation development (SSID) was considered capable of attracting initial investment, required shorter construction periods, was comparatively easy to design, farmers were able to maintain the system themselves, and it had a lesser environmental impact. In general, to achieve a sustainable irrigation scheme, three systems must be established: a "water utilization system"; an "operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) system"; and a "succession system". This paper discusses SSID in SSA with regard to a number of important factors, i.e., environmental, economic, and social factors, all of which impact on the sustainability of SSID. The progress of low-input, effective, and sustainable irrigation development (LESID) and the impact of changing aid modalities is followed in three countries, Ghana, Malawi, and Tanzania. In addition, the future effective implementation of SSID by way of LESID in other SSA countries is discussed. A self-supported SSID (as employed in Malawi) is currently considered the most appropriate LESID for least developed countries (LDCs) in SSA.},

abstract = {In early 1997, the Texas Edwards Aquifer Authority implemented a pilot Irrigation Suspension Program with the objectives of increasing springflow and providing relief to municipalities during drought. Irrigators were paid an average of {\$}234 per acre to suspend water use, a price higher than regional land rental rates. Auction theory and program implementation details suggest that the program implementation partially caused inflated bids. The Irrigation Suspension Program is also compared to two alternative programs: (1) subsidizing more efficient irrigation technology and (2) buying land. The irrigation suspension is found to be more cost-effective relative to subsidizing improved irrigation efficiency because it can be put in place only when aquifer levels are low. Land purchase is a cheaper alternative if the bid levels remain at the levels observed.},

abstract = {The Decision Support System for Irrigation (DSIRR) is a DSS for the economic-environmental assessment of agricultural activity focusing on irrigation, designed to answer both public and private needs. The program simulates the economically driven decision processes of farmers, permitting an accurate description of production and irrigation in terms of technology and agronomics. Distinct farm models can be constructed to describe the relevant production system in the catchment. Short and long term analyses can be conducted, the latter with endogenous investment choices. Solutions are found by applying multicriterial mathematical programming techniques. Farm models run under a graphical interface, which allows the user to quantify, by farm type, the utilization of water, labour and machinery, considering different types of soils, irrigation systems, water-yield functions and seasonality. Data are aggregated at catchment scale. Richness of information produced, flexibility and simplicity of use make DSIRR a useful tool for more sustainable agriculture and the definition of a sound water policy.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the world's population, the shortage of freshwater resources becomes increasingly serious. Farmland irrigation would not survive without fresh water which comes from river nearby. The low irrigation efficiency of the existing irrigation system needs to be tackled for efficient and effective usage of freshwater with low-cost. It is recognised that the water-saving irrigation technologies, such as the drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation, furrow irrigation in horizontal direction, plastic film mulching, ditch irrigation technology, etc. should be strongly promoted in order to develop water-saving agriculture. However all these measures require cutting-edge technologies and heavy investment, which poses a big problem particularly for the developing countries. On the other hand, if water and nutrients can be applied directly to the crop at root level, the positive effects on yield and water savings can be achieved, thereby increasing the irrigation performance. The water-yield relationship has been investigated using different methods of limited water applications and programs. Therefore, designing and fabricating technological irrigation system of low cost with maximising yield that can reasonably use water for agriculture is an urgent issue to today's world. The intelligent irrigation system provides a potential solution to solve the water shortage problems. In this study, an intelligent water-saving irrigation system is designed using Solidworks and some parts of the system are fabricated using a home-made fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D Printer. The intelligent irrigation for different plants is successfully achieved and the irrigation efficiency is significantly improved. The employment of the home-made 3D printer not only substantially reduces the manufacture costs, but also makes it possible to fabricate any “ad hoc” irrigation system.},

@article{Ruiz2006,
abstract = {As the population of southwestern New Mexico expands, land application of industrial and municipal wastewater is increasingly seen as a cost-effective and environmentally safe water management technique. Yet virtually no management guidelines exist for scheduling land application of wastewater in semi-arid climates of the United States. This article describes a web-based methodology for scheduling wastewater irrigation in the Chihuahuan Desert. It also details how to input data that are specific to the region and climate into a spreadsheet program to schedule wastewater irrigation at rates that avoid adverse effects to the application site. A website helps utility managers outside of New Mexico use the methodology. An irrigation schedule created by this technique was tested over three years in Las Cruces, N. M. The land application was designed to maximize vegetative cover to increase the capacity of a site to serve as a sink for wastewater contaminants, minimize salt accumulation in the root zone, and avoid nitrate leaching into the groundwater. The step-by-step instructions provided here help utilities eliminate the guesswork of how much and when to apply water in a land application process.},

abstract = {Precision irrigation represents those strategies aiming to feed the plant needs following the soil's spatial and temporal characteristics. Such a differential irrigation requires a different approach and equipment with regard to conventional irrigation to reduce the environmental impact and the resources use while maximizing the production and thus profitability. This study described the development of an open source soil moisture LoRa (long-range) device and analysis of the data collected and updated directly in the field (i.e., weather station and ground sensor). The work produced adaptive supervised predictive models to optimize the management of agricultural precision irrigation practices and for an effective calibration of other agronomic interventions. These approaches are defined as adaptive because they self-learn with the acquisition of new data, updating the on-the-go model over time. The location chosen for the experimental setup is a cultivated area in the municipality of Tenna (Trentino, Alto Adige region, Italy), and the experiment was conducted on two different apple varieties during summer 2019. The adaptative partial least squares time-lag time-series modeling, in operative field conditions, was a posteriori applied in the consortium for 78 days during the dry season, producing total savings of 255 mm of irrigated water and 44,000 kW of electricity, equal to 10.82{\%}.},

abstract = {ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of topical irrigation versus injection of lidocaine on the ovarian pedicle to provide analgesia in bitches ovariectomy. In the current study were monitored: increased blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate to identify an acute intraoperative nociceptive response. These parameters were registered at six times during the surgical procedure: grasping of the ovary (time 1), dissection of the mesosalpinx (time 2), tightening of the first loop ligature (time 3), tightening of the second loop ligature (time 4), transection of the ovarian pedicle (time 5) and release of the ovary (time 6).Material and MethodsForty healthy bitches were randomly assigned in two groups (n = 20) to receive topical irrigation (splash block) of 2{\%} lidocaine (C group) on both ovarian pedicle (2 mg/kg each), or an equal volume of lidocaine was injected at the same sites (R group).ResultsThe results of the present study suggest that splash block may provide intraoperative analgesic effects equivalent to injection in the ovarian pedicle in dogs that have undergone ovariectomy. The lidocaine improved surgical analgesia during canine ovariectomy in both groups, and this action is not affected by the inoculation technique.Clinical significancePain management in veterinary patients is a crucial component of appropriate patient care. Therefore, the need for achieving safer anaesthesia for surgical intervention is gaining much attention. Ovariectomy is a common surgical procedure in bitches with medium level of pain. This study concluded that considering its relative simplicity, low cost, and safety, both techniques could be used in daily clinical practice.},

abstract = {Irrigated rice is a luxurious consumer of water. Dry-seeded rice culture is an option that saves water, but may entail loss in crop yield implying a trade-off of productivity and water conservation. This study evaluates the water balance and productivity response of dry-seeded rice to management interventions using ORYZA2000 model. The database was generated from field studies involving combinations of planting dates and irrigation regimes. The performance of the model in simulating phenology, biomass, water use and yield was reasonable within the experimental conditions. The normalized root mean square of deviation (RMSDn) for simulated and measured harvest-time biomass and grain yield was 12 and 16{\%}, while RMSDn for progressive soil water content and water use was less than 10{\%}. Scenario analysis using historical weather data showed that rice planted on June 16 had minimum variance in potential yield (5.4{\%}) compared to earlier (June 1) or later (July 1) planting. The evapotranspiration (ET)-based water productivity (WPET) was greater for June 16 and July 1 than June 1 planting. Loss of yield and WPET with reduction in irrigation frequency were least on June 16 rice implying this as optimal planting time of rice in the study region.},

abstract = {Using the philosophy of system thinking, this paper conceptualizes the dynamics governing major structural and non-structural measures for rehabilitation of irrigation networks aimed at improving the irrigation utilities. The dynamics of improvement of irrigation networks is studied, on the basis of indicators such as adequacy, efficiency, equity, flexibility and dependability. In the present paper, the application of system dynamics analysis is demonstrated by applying it to six irrigation areas in Iran to present irrigation causal loop diagrams. The results, specifically for the Qazvin irrigation network, have been documented based on the facts. For the Qazvin irrigation network, system utility not only improves through increase in investment planning, but through conjunctive water management, reducing social constraints, and control of crop patterns and the cultivated area. Reduction of social and legal constraints with change of structural and non-structural measures to longer-term sustainable measures is more effective than the other policies. As a conclusion it could be stated that the system dynamics approach can be successfully applied to integrated analysis of irrigation network policy options, as well as to identification of key factors leading to degradation of irrigation networks and how to make effective decisions to sustain system utility over time.

La dynamique d'amelioration des reseaux d'irrigation est etudiee, sur la base d'indicateurs de reseaux d'irrigation telles que l'adequation, l'efficacite, l'equite, la flexibilite et la fiabilite. Dans le present document, l'analyse dynamique du systeme est appliquee a six zones d'irrigation en Iran (Dez, Qazvin, Zayandeh Rood, Zarineh Rood, Moghan et Sefidrood et Foumanat) et se traduit par la presentation de diagrammes d'irrigation en boucle de causalite. Les resultats, en particulier pour le reseau d'irrigation de Qazvin, ont ete documentes sur la base des faits. Toutes les parties prenantes des reseaux d'irrigation croient que des solutions non structurelles sont plus pertinentes que les solutions structurelles pour ameliorer l'utilite, parce que la plupart des solutions de rehabilitation non structurelles sont considerees comme exogenes, le modele montre que l'utilite peut etre plus sensible aux mesures structurelles qu'a celles non structurelles. Le systeme du reseau d'irrigation de Qazvin s'ameliore par l'accroissement du programme d'investissement, mais aussi par l'usage conjoint des eaux, la reduction des contraintes sociales, le controle des rotations culturales et celui de la superfice irriguee. La reduction des contraintes legales et sociales avec l'adoption d'objectifs durables a long terme des mesures structurelles et non structurelles est plus efficace que les autres politiques. En conclusion on peut affirmer que l'approche dynamique du systeme peut etre appliquee avec succes pour l'analyse integree des options de politique integree des reseaux d'irrigation, tout autant qu'a l'identification des facteurs cles menant a la degradation des reseaux d'irrigation et a la facon de prendre des decisions efficaces pour stabiliser l'utilite du systeme au fil du temps.

abstract = {In the first paper of this series, the Loma de Quinto Irrigation District (LQD) was characterised, and water use was assessed. In this work, the analysis of the LQD is completed with field irrigation evaluations, solid-set sprinkler irrigation simulations and irrigation scheduling for optimal crop yield. The results of the irrigation evaluations indicated that the average Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CU) for solid-sets, centre-pivots and linear-moves was 68.0, 75.5, and 80.0{\%}, respectively. In solid-sets CU was severely reduced by wind speed. However, in centre-pivots and linear-moves CU was higher in evaluations with wind speeds between 2 and 6ms−1 than under calm conditions. The evaluation data set was used to validate a ballistic solid-set sprinkler irrigation simulation model. The performance variables used for model validation were CU and the potential application efficiency of the low quarter (PAElq). Both variables were adequately predicted in the range of the observed values. The model was used to extend the evaluation results to all the solid-set plots in the LQD. CU maps were produced for different wind speeds and operating pressures. These maps can be used to identify plots with low irrigation performance. The effect of irrigation scheduling on crop yield and net benefit was analysed using the CropWat simulation model. Simulations of the 1997 irrigation practices performed on a limited number of plots detected a 12{\%} decrease in crop yield due to deficit irrigation and/or large irrigation intervals. The introduction of an optimal irrigation schedule (avoiding yield reductions) would imply increasing the alfalfa seasonal irrigation depth by 101mm, and applying light, frequent irrigation events. Due to labour scarcity in the LQD, the implementation of the optimal schedule would require a high degree of irrigation automation, which is currently unavailable. Taking into consideration the value of the additional yield and the costs of the extra irrigation water depth and the automation devices, the resulting net benefit would be 50ha−1. The purpose of this analysis of the LQD is to contribute to the diagnostic analysis phase of an incipient Management Improvement Program at the LQD. In order to complete this phase, an interdisciplinary committee will perform a study not just on irrigation but on a wide scope of irrigated agriculture in the LQD.},

abstract = {In areas where water is scarce, the use of regulated deficit irrigation,
combined with decision support system tools, may decrease the impact of
agriculture on natural water resources, as well as on energy
consumption, thereby improving the profitability of farms. With this
aim, the SUBSTOR-Potato model (incorporated in the DSSAT Program) was
evaluated with a 2-year field test (2011 and 2012) conducted in a
semi-arid area (Albacete, Spain) applying four irrigation levels (120,
100, 80 and 60{\%} of irrigation requirements). Subsequently, the model
was used for simulating the potato yield under several deficit
irrigation strategies (ISs) during 30 years of a semi-arid climate
(1988-2017) and determining the most profitable option. The considered
ISs were deemed those most suitable from the yield and water
productivity point of view by some authors. The model performance for
tuber yield was satisfactory with an index of agreement {\textgreater}0.91 and errors
between 0.71 and 3.06 x 10(3) kg/ha. The ISs simulated with
SUBSTOR-Potato showed that slight deficit irrigation (5-10{\%}) may
increase the water productivity and profitability of the farms.
Moreover, tuber formation (from onset of tuber initiation to harvest)
was shown to be the most sensitive stage, therefore it is highly
recommended to avoid deficit during this stage, which would cause a
large reduction in yield (around 8 t/ha, depending on the level of
deficit suffered by the crop).},

abstract = {Multiple stresses are putting great pressure on water resources systems. Population growth, climate change, prosperity, energy production, food crisis, and water governance are among the factors straining water resources. Decision makers from rich to poor countries and from commercial to non-governmental organisations are struggling to devise schemes to adapt to these stressed water conditions. Better efficiency for water resources systems, and particularly irrigation systems, is recommended as one of the most important responses to climate change, unsustainable development, and water shortage. However, using certain efficiencies such as Classical Efficiency caused systems not to perform according to decision makers' objectives. Effective Efficiency is a robust composite indicator that includes in its formulation both a flow weight, taking into account the leaching fraction, and reuse of return flows. Classical Efficiency is defined as the percentage of the diversion consumed beneficially, such as by crop evapotranspiration. Effective Efficiency, on the other hand, is defined as the ratio of beneficial consumptive use to total consumption, expressed as a percentage. In this paper, a normalised and non-dimensional form of Effective Efficiency is developed and necessary constraints for its successful application are explained. These constraints express water balance, flow weights and their thresholds, water reuse, and total consumptive use. Basic guidelines are proposed for better decision making in determining possible interventions for improving Effective Efficiency. This is done by analysing its domain through analytical and graphical methods. Three real cases are considered, namely, Imperial Irrigation District and Grand Valley irrigation systems in the United States and Nile Valley in upper Egypt. Three-dimensional sensitivity analysis is performed on Effective Efficiency and its variables using the three cases. This leads to an examination of the validity of the analysis and to suggestions for better intervention options. Meanwhile, it is also shown why Classical Efficiency should be used with care.},

abstract = {Scientifically based irrigation scheduling programs are dependent upon the accurate computation of crop evapotranspiration (ET). The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation is widely used to estimate reference crop ET where the climatic data it requires are available. This ET estimation method was used for the past five years in an irrigation scheduling program (Prj-NAPI) for a 28,000-hectare irrigation project in northern New Mexico. This research used water balance data, including neutron probe soil moisture measurements, to evaluate the accuracy of the method on a large-scale center pivot project.    A 7.5-cm cumulative difference was found between ET measured and ET calculated in the early part of the growing season. Several possible causes were analyzed: errors in Prj-NAPI FAO-56 ET calculation function, errors in neutron probe measurements taken near the soil surface, errors in the crop growth stages used in conjunction with tabulated FAO-56 Kcb coefficients, errors in the weather data used in reference ET calculations, errors in the FAO-56 model calculation: specifically the effect of high winds, errors in the application efficiency used, and errors caused by not using the FAO-56 suggested climatic correction.

abstract = {Background: Drought is one of the major constraints for plant productivity worldwide. Different mechanisms of drought-tolerance have been reported for several plant species including maize. However, the differences in global gene expression between drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes and their relationship to physiological adaptations to drought are largely unknown. The study of the differences in global gene expression between tolerant and susceptible genotypes could provide important information to design more efficient breeding programs to produce maize varieties better adapted to water limiting conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Changes in physiological responses and gene expression patterns were studied under drought stress and recovery in three Mexican maize landraces which included two drought tolerant (Cajete criollo and Michoac{\'{a}}n 21) and one susceptible (85-2) genotypes. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, soil and leaf water potentials were monitored throughout the experiment and microarray analysis was carried out on transcripts obtained at 10 and 17 days following application of stress and after recovery irrigation. The two tolerant genotypes show more drastic changes in global gene expression which correlate with different physiological mechanisms of adaptation to drought. Differences in the kinetics and number of up- and down-regulated genes were observed between the tolerant and susceptible maize genotypes, as well as differences between the two tolerant genotypes. Interestingly, the most dramatic differences between the tolerant and susceptible genotypes were observed during recovery irrigation, suggesting that the tolerant genotypes activate mechanisms that allow more efficient recovery after a severe drought. Conclusions/Significance: A correlation between levels of photosynthesis and transcription under stress was observed and differences in the number, type and expression levels of transcription factor families were also identified under drought and recovery between the three maize landraces. Gene expression analysis suggests that the drought tolerant landraces have a greater capacity to rapidly modulate more genes under drought and recovery in comparison to the susceptible landrace. Modulation of a greater number of differentially expressed genes of different TF gene families is an important characteristic of the tolerant genotypes. Finally, important differences were also noted between the tolerant landraces that underlie different mechanisms of achieving tolerance.},

abstract = {Irrigation development is a gateway to increased agricultural, water and land productivity, increased household and national food security. However, irrigation development has been a major challenge in many developing countries, including Zimbabwe. The launch of the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in 2003 ushered in new unskilled cadres and this was followed by a reduction in area developed for irrigation from 200,000ha to approximately 120,000ha. This was due to thefts, dilapidation, and vandalism of irrigation infrastructure. The government made efforts to develop and bring back the 200,000ha into operational, but little has been achieved. To assess irrigation development post FTLRP, a case study was done in Goromonzi District. Using a Trend Analysis to assess the trend in irrigation funding, a downward trend was revealed. A Gross Margin Analysis, modeled via the Business Coefficient Expansion Factor (BCEF) to evaluate productivity and profitability of the irrigation enterprises showed that farmers performed below average and major irrigation crops were below the ideal BCEF threshold of 2.5, suggesting non-profitability of irrigation enterprises. An analysis on infrastructure revealed that most of it was partially or non-functional, hence farmers reduced area under irrigation. The study also revealed non-accessibility of training services by farmers. The study concluded that inadequate irrigation funding, low irrigation productivity, nonprofitability of irrigation enterprises, poor cost recovery mechanisms and lack of relevant training has led to low irrigation development. The study recommends that national governments should formulate and hold sound irrigation development strategies and encouraged to partner with public and private institutions in defining and implementing such comprehensive strategies for sustainable irrigation development.},

abstract = {This study combined continuous monitoring in the field using computer modeling to understand soil water movement and salt transport so as to design a suitable irrigation system for cotton using mulched drip irrigation with brackish water. A reasonable irrigation regime was determined and verified using thresholds of water and salinity stress in the various stages of cotton growth. In addition, some key factors, such as emitter discharge rate, emitter spacing, and initial water content, were screened for simulation, and irrigation uniformity and desalination rate were selected as the indicators for evaluation. The results showed that: (i) The HYDRUS-3D model was a useful tool for designing suitable irrigation regimes, and the determined suitable irrigation quota was 5160 m3 hm−2 under mulched drip irrigation with brackish water during the growth period of cotton in 2019. (ii) The irrigation uniformity and leaching rate decreased with an increase in the emitter discharge, and the linear relationship between uniformity, leaching rate, and emitter discharge could be identified. (iii) The irrigation uniformity and leaching rate decreased with an increase in emitter spacing, and power functions might be used to calculate uniformity, leaching rate, and emitter spacing. (iv) The irrigation uniformity and leaching rate increased with an increase in initial water content, and the relationship between the two indexes and initial water content was defined by a linear function and a power function, respectively. These results provided a valuable reference for the rational use of drip irrigation with brackish water.Alternate abstract:La pr{\'{e}}sente {\'{e}}tude combinait la surveillance continue sur le terrain et la mod{\'{e}}lisation sur ordinateur en vue de mieux comprendre les d{\'{e}}placements de l'eau et le transport du sel dans le sol, et ainsi concevoir un syst{\`{e}}me d'irrigation au goutte-{\`{a}}-goutte utilisant de l'eau saum{\^{a}}tre qui conviendrait {\`{a}} la culture du coton sur paillis.

abstract = {China's major grain-producing areas have the important role of ensuring the nation's grain security. Farmland water conservation projects, which are financed by government investment and promoted by additional government policies, are vital for grain and agricultural production. Analysing the determinants of good performance of farmland water conservation, and the performance of government investments and interventions in major grain-producing areas, are important for understanding whether the scale and structure of investment are reasonable and, hence, efficient. We apply the data envelopment analysis (DEA) Malmquist index method and panel data feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) model to data from China's major grain-producing areas between 1990 and 2014. Based on this two-step Malmquist and FGLS model, we estimate the performance of farmland water conservation and the determinants of performance, emphasizing the effects of government investment and other public policies. The results show that current investment policies do not result in efficient performance in farmland water conservation projects. The scale of investment is too small and its structure needs to be adjusted. In contrast, increasing the level of economic development promotes the performance of these investments. However, rural education focusing on urban jobs rather than on modern farming skills pulls in the opposite direction. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The concepts of irrigation governance and management are often confused while reforming irrigation institutions. This paper distinguishes between irrigation governance and management and articulates the governance concept and its ingredients through a literature review. The governance performance of irrigation reforms from selected cases in Asia is analyzed using a conceptual model. The paper identifies five key concepts in analyzing governance reform as institutions, intentions, instruments, implementation and impact. The analysis reveals that poor governance results from poor design of representation and accountability in the reform. The interplay between institutions, their intentions, instruments and implementation arrangements used by reformers in the selected cases have tended to create information asymmetries amongst the users, which have led to poor awareness and participation by potential members for effective governance. When reforming irrigation governance attention needs to be paid to institutions, reform intentions, instruments, and implementation arrangements simultaneously. Design weaknesses of any one of these four components of governance can lead to suboptimal impacts. The studied management transfer programs remained unable to improve irrigation governance owing to weakness in one or more of these governance ingredients.},

abstract = {Increasing water scarcity and rising fertilizer cost warrant their judicious use in the world agriculture. It implies that management interventions should synchronize crop needs with soil supplies of these resources in the root zone to reduce probability of water and nutrient stresses and yield loss. This study examines the applicability of SUBSTOR-Potato model in analyzing potato response to irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a semi-arid sub-tropical environment of Punjab. In order to evaluate the model, database was generated by establishing a field experiment on potato (cv. Kufri Badshah) planted in mid-October on a sandy loam soil. Combinations of three irrigation regimes viz., irrigation water (IW) to pan evaporation (Ep) ratios of 0.8, 1.4 and 2.0 and four N rates viz., 0, 135, 180 and 225kgha−1 were randomized in a split-plot design with three replications. Half dose of N for a given rate was applied at planting and the rest half with a common irrigation 4 weeks after planting. The crop was managed for pest control by adopting local recommendations and harvested in end-January. Irrigation and fertilizer N had significant effects on tuber fresh yield, water use and N uptake. Performance of the SUBSTOR-Potato model was reasonable as indicated by close agreement of simulated crop phenology, biomass, water use, tuber yield and N uptake with the measured data. The normalized root mean square of deviations (RMSD) between simulated and measured values for harvest-time dry biomass and fresh tuber yield was 7.3 and 12.6{\%}, while normalized RSMD for seasonal water use (ET+drainage) and total (tuber+haulm)N uptake was 12.4 and 19{\%}. Simulation of tuber yield for independent data (2008–2009) was as good as for calibration data (2010–2011) giving confidence in the model. Scenario analysis based on historical weather data showed that mean potential tuber yield was 50.8tha−1 for October 1 planting that reduced to 41.8 and 37.8tha−1 for later (October 16 and October 31) plantings. The analysis also demonstrated that yield and ET-based water productivity (WPET) were greater on a sandy loam than a loamy sand soil for comparable irrigation and N regime. Interaction effects of irrigation and N on yield and ET indicated that irrigation response was greater in the presence of N. Greater initial soil water status reduced irrigation and N needs than with lower initial soil water for comparable tuber yield. Initial soil mineral-N also affected N and irrigation regime to achieve a given yield.},

abstract = {Surgical site infections (SSI) are common complications after open ventral hernia repair (OVHR), potentially requiring further intervention. Antibiotic lavage before abdominal closure has been shown to lower the incidence in intra-abdominal and soft tissue SSI. A retrospective review of OVHR was performed with mesh at Greenville Health System Hernia Center between 2008 and 2017. Patients were divided into three groups, receiving no antibiotic irrigation (Grp 1, n = 260), gentamicin alone (Grp 2, n = 263), or gentamicin + clindamycin (G + C) irrigation (Grp 3, n = 299). Differences in categorical variables among the three groups were tested using chi-squared or Fischer's exact test (for n {\textless} 5). Analysis of continuous variables was performed using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test for differences in length of stay. Logistic regression was performed using all clinically relevant variables to determine the effects of irrigation on SSI. Incidence of surgical site occurrence was significantly lower after G + C irrigation (Grp 1,28.1{\%}; Grp 2,35.4{\%}; Grp 3,19.7{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). Incidence of SSI was significantly lower after G + C irrigation, but not G alone (Grp 1, 16.5{\%}; Grp 2, 15.2{\%}; and Grp 3, 5.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated significantly increased SSI with contaminated wounds (OR 2.96; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.39-6.21), dirty wounds (OR 3.84; 95{\%} CI 1.49-9.69), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 3.70; 95{\%} CI 2.16-6.38), as expected. Use of G + C was an independent predictor of decreased SSI (OR 0.33; 95{\%} CI 0.16-0.67). Irrigation with a combined G + C antibiotic irrigation significantly reduces the incidence of surgical site infection after OVHR with mesh.},

abstract = {Since, landfill areas are still the most widely used solid waste disposal method across the world, leachate generated from landfills should be given importance. Leachate of landfills exerts environmental risks mostly on surface and groundwater with its high pollutant content, which may cause unbearable water quality. This leads to the obligation for decontamination and remediation program to be taken into progress for the landfill area. Among a number of alternatives to cope with leachate, one is to employ the technology of phytoremediation. The main objective of this study was to determine the N accumulation ratios and the effects of landfill leachate in diluted proportions of chosen ratios (as 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 0), on the growth and development of Cynodon dactylon, Stenotaphrum secundatum, Paspalum notatum, Pennisetum clandestinum, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Nerium oleander, Pelargonium peltatum and Kochia scoparia species. In order to simulate the actual conditions of the landfill, soil covering the landfill is taken and used as medium for the trials. The study showed that S. secundatum, K. scoparia and N. oleander species had an impressive survival rate of 100{\%}, being irrigated with pure leachate, while the others' survival rates were between 0 to 35{\%} under the same conditions. As expected, application of leachate to the plants caused an increase in the accumulation of N, in the upper parts of all plants except P. peltatum. The highest N content increase was observed at S. Secundatum set, accumulating 3.70 times higher than its control set, whereas P. clandestinum value was 3.41 times of its control set.},

abstract = {Water‐saving irrigation is of high priority in China for alleviation of the water resource supply–demand contradiction. Consequently, the objectives of irrigation water efficiency (IWE) are specified in policies at the macro scale such as national economic and social development programmes and national evaluation systems of water resources management. To scientifically evaluate IWE and water‐saving irrigation efficiency and to overcome the limitations of traditional IWE evaluation methods (e.g. numerous steps and not very practical), this study presents a normative and easy‐to‐use measurement and analysis method for IWE, specifically, head and end measurement. An IWE monitoring network, comprising more than 3700 irrigation districts on national and regional scales, was developed to dynamically monitor the variation in IWE of sample irrigation districts of different sizes and types from 2008 to 2018. The monitoring results provide technical support and scientific evidence for the formulation of water conservation policies and management at the macro scale of the water conservation sector. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}L'irrigation qui {\'{e}}conomise l'eau est hautement prioritaire en Chine pour att{\'{e}}nuer la contradiction entre l'offre et la demande de ressources en eau.

abstract = {A typical irrigation scheduling problem is one of preparing a schedule to service a group of outlets. These outlets may either be serviced sequentially or simultaneously. This problem has an analogy with the classical earliness/tardiness machine scheduling problems in operations research (OR). In previous published work integer programme were used to solve such problems; however, such scheduling problems belong to a class of combinatorial problems known to be computationally demanding (NP-hard). This is widely reported in OR. Hence integer programme can only be used to solve relatively small problems usually in a research environment where considerable computational resources and time can be allocated to solve a single schedule. For practical applications meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing or tabu search methods need to be used. However as reported in the literature, these need to be formulated carefully and tested thoroughly. This thesis demonstrates how arranged-demand irrigation scheduling problems can be correctly formulated and solved using genetic algorithms (GA). By interpreting arrangeddemand irrigation scheduling problems as single or multi-machine scheduling problems, the wealth of information accumulated over decades in OR is capitalized on. The objective is to schedule irrigation supplies as close as possible to the requested supply time of the farmers to provide a better level of service. This is in line with the concept of Service Oriented Management (SOM), described as the central goal of irrigation modernization in recent literature. This thesis also emphasizes the importance of rigorous evaluation of heuristics such as GA. First, a series of single machine models is presented that models the warabandi (rotation) type of irrigation distribution systems, where farmers are supplied water sequentially. Next, the multimachine models are presented which model the irrigation water distribution systems where several farmers may be supplied water simultaneously. Two types of multimachine models are defined. The simple multimachine models where all the farmers are supplied with identical discharges and the complex multimachine models where the farmers are allowed to demand different discharges. Two different approaches i.e. the stream tube approach and the time block approach are used to develop the multimachine models. These approaches are evaluated and compared to determine the suitability of either for the irrigation scheduling problems, which is one of the significant contributions of this thesis. The multimachine models are further enhanced by incorporating travel times which is an important part of the surface irrigation canal system and need to be taken into account when determining irrigation schedules. The models presented in this thesis are unique in many aspects. The potential of GA for a wide range of irrigation scheduling problems under arranged demand irrigation system is fully explored through a series of computational experiments.},

abstract = {A quasi-optimum irrigation season calendar based on economic profit maximization for sloping and runoff-free furrows can be obtained by OPTIMEC (EConomic OPTIMization, in Spanish), a seasonal furrow irrigation model based on the concept of comprehensive irrigation. The model features four components: a soil moisture model, an irrigation hydraulic model, a crop yield model and an economic optimization module. This module uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a heuristic technique based on the laws of natural selection, to maximize farmer profit. The GA is a suitable technique to solve the problem of profit maximization due to the difficulties inherent in traditional optimization procedures, which require an explicit function relating flow rate, water depth and profit. For its practical application the model has been implemented in a Visual Basic program. A real case is analysed to compare the irrigation season scheduling using traditional criteria (event by event scheduling) and optimization-based criteria.},

abstract = {Performance improvement in irrigated agriculture in Sri Lanka is vital in view of the contribution it makes to the national economy, in addition to the livelihood of large numbers of people depending on irrigated agriculture and the competing demands that are emerging in the water resources sector. Taking into account the potential available for improvement in the irrigation sector, a performance assessment programme was initiated in 1997, starting with a smaller number of irrigation schemes gradually expanding to include other schemes. The indicators initially selected for assessment were simple but effective in categorizing schemes based on their performance and identifying where attention was required. Performance improvement interventions included both planning and management interventions. Continuation of the programme evolved into a programme of benchmarking where comparison of performance with other schemes or performance of the same scheme over a period was done and found to be effective as a tool for performance improvement. By joining the ICID, IPTRID, FAO, WB and IWMI assisted benchmarking initiative in 2002, it is further expected that this activity can be done more formally and effectively.},

@article{Friedman2017,
abstract = {The DIDAS software package assists in drip-irrigation system design and irrigation scheduling. It is based on analytical solutions of the linearized water flow equation. The problem of water flow and uptake is described by superposing solutions for positive sources (on-surface or subsurface emitters) and negative sinks (root systems). Steady water flow is assumed in the design module and unsteady flow in the irrigation-scheduling module. The design tool, based on the relative water-uptake rate (RWUR) criterion, assesses the effects on water-use efficiency of geometrical attributes: distances between emitters along drip lines, separation between drip lines, depth of subsurface emitters, and size and depth of root systems. For design purposes, it is assumed that there is no plant-atmosphere resistance to water uptake, i.e., roots are assumed to apply maximum suction and water-uptake rate depends only on the soil's ability to conduct water from sources to sinks. The RWUR computations require only three parameters describing soil texture, root-zone size, and potential evaporation. The optimizing tool for irrigation scheduling is based on a relative water-uptake volume (RWUV) criterion. The RWUV computations for a given drip-irrigation design require additional information on the diurnal pattern of plant resistance to water uptake and soil hydraulic conductivity. DIDAS also contains a diurnal pattern module to evaluate diurnal water-uptake patterns; it assumes quasi-steady flow, accounts for diurnal variations in plant-atmosphere resistance and evaporation, and serves for fine-tuning the design and in preliminary evaluation of scheduling scenarios. DIDAS was programmed in Delphi, runs on a PC under the Windows operating system, and requires no further software. The drip-irrigation scenario is constructed via a few GUI windows, which also contain a library of the required soil input parameters, and a best-fitting procedure to determine them. The computed RWURs and RWUVs are displayed graphically and the tabulated output results can be exported to, e.g., Microsoft Excel for further processing. An updated DIDAS version can be downloaded freely from http://app.agri.gov.il/didas. From March 2014 through July 2016, 877 people from 94 countries downloaded the first or second DIDAS versions (1.0.1 and 1.1.1, respectively). We briefly introduce drip irrigation and other available programs for its design and scheduling, outline the major DIDAS concepts, and illustrate the operation of the main software modules.},

abstract = {In this research, the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is proposed as a methodology to overcome the problems related to the lack of methodology to assign the correct weightings for the calculation of indexes and to the subjectivity of the interpretations of results. DEA is a linear programming technique to determine the relative efficiencies of a company when the inputs and outputs of production units within the company are known, but the productive process itself is not. In this way, quantitative efficiencies and the weighting of any performance indicator can be assessed and compared, permitting managers to obtain a well-defined performance ranking. This is especially important when managers dispose of a limited budget. The results of the application of this methodology to Andalusian irrigation districts (Spain) are presented and discussed here. This study was used to select the most representative irrigation districts in Andalusia which were then studied in greater depth by applying the performance indicators selected by IPTRID for use by the benchmarking international program.},

abstract = {This study aimed to apply a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model to estimate the annual risk probability of Salmonella infection associated with the consumption of crops, which were irrigated with raw wastewater abstracted by farmers without official permission. Data generated from the model were used to propose realistic standards for Salmonella in irrigation water needed for safe crop production. Results demonstrated the presence of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Salmonella in wastewater samples. Salmonella was recorded on lettuce and spinach in 3 different harvesting events, although it was not found in data obtained for parsley plant. The QMRA scenario included surface irrigation, consumption of raw crops, and 1‐day withholding period before harvest. The annual risk probability of Salmonella infection for consumers exceeded the target tolerable risk (7.7 × 10−4) for investigated crops. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between different annual risk probabilities showed significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.05). The levels of risk posed from spinach and lettuce were roughly similar, although they tended to be higher for lettuce. The optimum concentrations of Salmonella in irrigation water needed to satisfy the World Health Organization guidelines of disease burden (disability‐adjusted life years 10−6) per person per year ranged from 34 to 119 via multiple‐tube fermentation technique/100 mL, for spinach and lettuce plants, respectively. The study concluded that unofficial reuse of wastewater in irrigation is a principle route for crop contamination. Water quality monitoring programs should be integrated with QMRA investigations for better estimation of risk level. The fit parameters used could be tailored to cover a wide array of local situations in different countries. Models applied for viruses, helminths, and bacteria other than Salmonella are encouraged in future studies. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:353–361. {\textcopyright} 2019 SETAC},

abstract = {Because of Bolivia's agro-climatic conditions, irrigation has become a priority issue for our country's agricultural production. Therefore, rural people press for improvements for their existing irrigation systems or construction of new systems. Accordingly, irrigation system construction and upgrades figure prominently in municipal, prefecture and sub-prefecture operating plans. In this context, Bolivia is investing funds from various sources to implement numerous irrigation projects. One key aspect of Bolivian irrigation systems is that they are user-managed. The Bolivian government invests very little and has almost never invested any resources in water management; its role in regulating and creating norms for local water management has been relatively minor. This implies that any improvements introduced in them must ensure that user-management can continue, based on users' current or potential irrigation management capacity. Although most irrigation systems in Bolivia are community-managed1, there are many “threats”, partly involving irrigation projects themselves. So far, the results are discouraging. Much of the infrastructure built by intervention projects is not being used or is in bad condition, which calls for in-depth research into the causes. In response, this book sets out to explore these unforeseen threats from interventions expected to improve irrigated agriculture and farmers' responses to them, and to help learning for the future, through detailed case studies of four intervention projects to improve irrigation infrastructure and management. Its objectives are to explore and demonstrate the ‘divorce' that is taking place between how critical actors think about irrigation infrastructure design and management, and how designers often impose their own narrow preferences in infrastructure composition and performance, without reflecting on users' preferences and needs. It also sets out to debate the conditions that will help new irrigation infrastructure fit better in with management characteristics and production potential of irrigation systems, in order to guarantee sustainability. This research has devoted special attention to analyses of infrastructure, in relation to their management and support organisation. However, this study is not a detailed study of infrastructure hydraulics, nor a study of knowledge and biases in design, nor an ethnographic study of social practices. Rather it provides an integrated analysis of infrastructure, management principles to obtain water using that infrastructure, and intervention support to build both. This is done to show how farmers (re)create systems that are functional and sustainable according to their current needs, and can still enable new future possibilities for production and labour deployment by farmers. While infrastructure diagnosis and its relation to design is the critical empirical material, the entry and closing debate always relates it back to farmers' production systems. This thesis comprises 8 chapters. In general, the first chapter contains background on the research, the conceptual framework and the methodology. Also this chapter introduces the characteristics of the research sites regarding their agroecological zones, and an overview of agrarian {\&} economic reforms, irrigation development in and intervention policies in Bolivia. Chapter 2 presents the characteristics of traditional irrigation infrastructure and water management found in Bolivian irrigation systems, to provide an introductory context for the case studies. Chapters 3 through 6 show empirical data from four case studies. Chapter 7 analyses the findings, focusing on the infrastructure's adaptability to management capacity. Finally, Chapter 8 presents this study's conclusions. The first chapter reviews the different conceptual approaches used to address irrigation system design. The conceptual framework for the research is grounded in the conviction that irrigation technology is a social and technical phenomenon, with social requirements of use. The research framework is based on the fact that irrigation system design has two main dimensions: 1. The contents dimension, regarding outcomes, and involving the following main elements: infrastructure design, future water management design, and design of the agricultural production system under irrigation. 2. The process dimension, which studies the ways that decisions are made. This includes attention to the stakeholders involved in the process, their positions, roles and activities leading to design outcomes. Whether planning interventions that create new ones or transforming existing systems, these two dimensions are inseparable. However, for programmatic and methodological reasons, the overall focus of analysis in this research is on the content dimension and, within this dimension, specifically on infrastructure design and how its change is related with accepted changes in production and social organisation. It builds around the concept of ‘appropriateness' of technology, in both how a system is appropriate and suitable to current needs, but also how (and whether) farmers can transform a system themselves, or re-appropriate their system after its transformation, to run it themselves as relevant to local principles and practices. For this purpose, the following main research areas are developed to focus on the operational, material and productive dimensions between infrastructure and management: 1. Operational appropriateness of infrastructure to management capability (related to operations and functionality of a system). These are the institutional characteristics of requirements for use of the improved irrigation system overall and at local level, as related to management capacity, especially in rights, rules and roles and work needed to ensure water delivery and self-administration. 2. Technical appropriateness of infrastructure to management capability. These are the technical characteristics of improved physical settings in relation to management capability, especially in their hydraulic and constructive suitability and potential to ensure environmental stability, and their maintenance requirements. 3. Productive appropriateness of infrastructure in relation to management capability. This involves the possibilities for inter-related transformations of production options and management institutions with improved infrastructure. The second chapter will discuss two major aspects as a framework for this study: traditional infrastructure and small-farmer irrigation management. The issues addressed under each heading characterise irrigation systems in Bolivia in general and the wider experiences which the case studies document in more detail. In this context, irrigation projects have intervened to improve existing irrigation systems. Chapters 3 through 6 present the case studies for improved irrigation systems in Condorchinoka, San Roque - Capellan{\'{i}}a, Naranjos Margen Izquierda and Caigua, in that order. Each describes and analyses the characteristics of the improved infrastructure and of water management, contrasting farmers practice and projects' water management proposals. Agricultural production characteristics are also presented, emphasising changes in production scenarios as a result of irrigation system improvement. Then the design process is analysed, to understand the findings. This has served as a basis for analysing the infrastructure's adaptability to management capacity in each case, in terms of the three concepts presented in the conceptual framework. These four case studies are then compared in Chapter 7, which analyses the improved irrigation infrastructure and users' management capacity, again in terms of the three key concepts. The first concept (the infrastructure's operational adaptability to water management capacity) analyses three key aspects: a. Project proposals for future water management, and users' response. b. Management capacity to operate and maintain improved infrastructure. c. Requirements to operate and maintain new facilities, under farmers' management criteria. The analysis of infrastructure's technical adaptability to management capacity examines: a. the problems in the main infrastructure and their repercussions in system operation, examining the hydraulic adaptability of facilities and quality of construction in relation to users' operation and maintenance capacity. b. the main constraints on design and construction restricting management capacity. c. the main design and construction criteria contributing to management capacity, principally involving technical issues. Finally, to analyse adaptability of infrastructure to production in terms of management capacity, the following aspects are considered: a. production scenarios in relation to farmers' production strategy. b. the effects of improved irrigation systems on agricultural production. c. household economic income and labour availability. Chapter 7 also analyses the design process in order to understand findings, taking into account the following aspects: a. ways that project intervention approaches limit development of management capacity. b. non-interaction between users and engineers during design phases. c. implications of irrigation project eligibility indicators. An analysis of infrastructure's operational adaptability to management capacity leads to the conclusion that the inclusion or exclusion of water rights from the design process (in terms of people acquiring water rights) is one of the social aspects that engineers most often take into account, although quite “instrumentally”. In designing and implementing irrigation projects, there is a mechanical tendency to set up “irrigation committees / associations” with classic irrigation committee organisational structures. This type of parallel organisations does not work and is discarded by users, along with the related by-laws and regulations. Here it is important to recognise that irrigation systems are organised largely in response to water distribution (operation and division) requirements and infrastructure maintenance. Because operating tasks are usually simple, their respective responsibilities are not defined as complex activities entailing changes in the existing organisational structure, as could be the case in requirements resulting from changes in water distribution. Consequently, operational tasks are generally kept as an additional responsibility for authorities in charge of water distribution, or are handled by users themselves. Finally, a new issue arising out of the research is that, in improved irrigation systems, the organisation must cope with new maintenance requirements demands, which entails having knowledge, labour and capital. If the organisation does not have these factors, this jeopardises the system's sustainability, due to lack of organisational capacity. Therefore, it is necessary for infrastructure proposals to be evaluated jointly so that the options chosen do not surpass the organisation's management capacity and that of users overall. Regarding the competency to distribute water in improved irrigation systems, operating requirements for facilities constructed in the different irrigation systems studied are closely related to the water distribution mode. In the cases studied, water is delivered during the critical season by turns, rotating a single flow of water, in order to maintain the system's transparency and because little water is available. Accordingly, the only operating requirements are regulation and flow control. Regulation activities are limited to opening and closing gates on the different facilities, which family members can handle. Flow control must be minimal in improved systems. However, since some improved facilities in the case studies do not work adequately, due to a number of flaws in design and construction, users have to continue flow control or do extra tasks. This especially happens with siphons, intakes and canals with limited capacity. So, users have to take the trouble to carry out this additional activity, but they have sufficient knowledge to handle the situation. Findings indicate that it is vital to analyse water distribution alternatives (delivery mode and flow) in relation to the irrigation infrastructure. The fundamental issue is to ensure that the facilities designed and constructed will not constrain distribution practices. This means that the water delivery mode (continuous-discontinuous, single/multi-flow) must be defined clearly beforehand. This is a key element with implications for delivery flow, and therefore for the irrigation infrastructure's required capacity. Further, the delivery mode generates requirements regarding the type and characteristics of infrastructure, such as the need for regulation structures: fixed or mobile, intermediate ponds, measurement points, etc. The case studies show that new infrastructure maintenance is one of the main bottlenecks limiting improved irrigation systems' management capacity. In general, the requirements to maintain new infrastructure are not satisfactorily met by users. Evidently, renewed infrastructure upkeep entails “new” requirements, which users must perform to use improved technology appropriately. If they are unable to fulfil these new requirements (due to lack of knowledge, lack of resources, deficient facilities, or their being beyond their capacities) this jeopardises the irrigation system's sustainability and consequently its user-management capacity. This situation poses new conceptual and methodological challenges and calls for an attitude shift among professionals who intervene in small-farmer irrigation systems. An analysis of the infrastructure's technical adaptability to management capacity shows that one major cause for limited hydraulic and constructive suitability, affecting management capacity, involves deficient criteria for designing and building irrigation infrastructure to operate in the Andean environment. These deficiencies may be grouped into two main categories: 1. Design and construction criteria that interfere with infrastructure's operation, and 2. Design and construction criteria that restrict its hydraulic and constructive suitability. Regarding the first point, findings indicate that each irrigation system had improved facilities that did not work properly and were consequently misused. Improper use of facilities required continual repairs. When repair requirements surpassed user' possibilities, the facilities were abandoned or destroyed. Facilities worked badly most often due to engineers' simple mistakes, designing and constructing them without taking Andean region characteristics into account. One first functionality problem is when facilities are unsuited to their adverse physiographic location. Technical issues affecting functionality are often apparently too elementary to even discuss with farmers. Functionality of facilities is also impaired by from the poor quality of materials used to build them. In most cases studied, functionality problems stem from poor quality construction. Infrastructure functionality is also impaired by poor location of facilities, especially catchment abstraction facilities. The case studies also show that when engineers design, they normally ignore that these facilities are part of a network, which must operated connectedly and smoothly. One of the greatest deficiencies in this regard is the tendency to design and construct infrastructure components in isolation, ad hoc, without considering the implications for the remaining facilities and other components that comprise the irrigation system in its local setting. All the above issues, taken together, make facilities less functional, and some must be adjusted or changed, or even rebuilt. The current irrigation project cycle would have to add a stage called “adjustment”. However, such repairs call for additional funds, which Bolivia obviously cannot afford. The situation is even worse if we assume that users will be saddled with this responsibility (as shown in this research). So, this additional stage must be avoided. Case studies have shown the importance of: 1. user-engineer interaction during the design phase, so both groups share responsibility for the project, 2. serious, humble engineering stressing not only technical and mechanical design considerations but also users' possibilities to use the proposed infrastructure sustainably and 3. hiring supervisors who will enforce technical specifications, and help users monitor construction. Under the second point, the cases researched show that social requirements to use technology, to achieve hydraulic and constructive suitability, are limited more in terms of irrigation infrastructure maintenance than operation. The central issue is that engineers never posed the question, while designing and building, whether the case study facilities could be maintained by users. If usage requirements had been taken into account, particularly regarding maintenance, engineers would have met this need by considering simple, obvious criteria. This all shows that facilities' management capacity – specifically maintenance capacity – is strongly affected by their intrinsic characteristics. Engineers are designing and building without taking interactive design requirements into account. Local management conditions and environmental features of our region demand new concepts, including: Maintainability, Durability, Functionality, Operability and Safety. Since these criteria are left out of design, the current conceptual framework and design context within which civil engineers and agronomists work must be reviewed, questioned and changed. Also, irrigation project implementation processes in Bolivia must be questioned. The way irrigation projects are implemented does not make designers accountable for outcomes and allows builders to shirk on technical specifications, support entities to act irresponsibly, and supervisors to be negligent. An analysis of infrastructure's productive adaptability to management capacity leads us to conclude that renewing irrigation systems has indeed increased available water. With greater availability, users have changed their production scenarios (more land under irrigation, a new assortment of crops, better yields and a new planting schedule) which has improved their economic income. Changes in each irrigation system have been the result of farming activities by each user, based on their own aims and resources. In the case study projects researched, there has never been any institutional support for agricultural production to enable users to make better use of greater availability of water and optimise their farming strategies and yields. Even when they have increased their income, the case studies show that irrigation users still cannot afford the indispensable requirement -maintenance of the rehabilitated infrastructure. In general, their economic capacity – even under the new situation – falls short of the requirements to maintain the new infrastructure. No infrastructure will ever be sustainable if not maintained, which requires labour and money. So, irrigation infrastructure's adaptability or suitability for rural economies depends on how irrigated agriculture is addressed during irrigation projects' pre-investment, investment and post-project phases. Findings show that this situation is not being faced adequately. This will require further research, to set guidelines for irrigation investments, so they can better transform local economies and their impacts up to the national level. Infrastructure requiring less farmer investment in operation and maintenance, while making a greater impact on local livelihoods, will enable irrigation system users to meet their families' needs, while also fulfilling the economic requirements to maintain their irrigation systems. This shows the need to set institutional policies not only for irrigation project implementation, but also to help users plan their agricultural production, so the country's various eco-regions can design their own local development proposals. This will contribute, in turn, to designing regional and national proposals, and to rethinking agriculture, to be more sustainable in environmental and socio-economic terms. In conclusion, these three fundamental concepts are inter-related. It is crucial to take them into account in designing improved irrigation systems under small-farmer management, so that systems can once again be community-managed and sustainable. Finally, analysing the design process has shown how results found to facilitate or limit infrastructure's management capacity are the outgrowth of positions taken, decisions made and attitudes shown by the different stakeholders involved in the intervention process. However, these intervention behaviours have been moulded by their different socio-economic, political and cultural contexts, and their capacity to involve other players in their “own” projects. Under these conditions, stakeholders' strategies and actions have influenced the flow of different events in each case. Moreover, each project has followed its own process, shaped by the economic, social, political and cultural setting. Different processes have revealed numerous weaknesses, including insufficient knowledge of the overall design of irrigation systems, and the lack of any interactive design. Research in the context of our reality, as in this case, can provide a foundation to generate new concepts and methodologies to support these design processes, in order to break out of slavish application of pre-established recipes, protocols or patterns. We must remember that users have to manage their systems, so they must be involved in decisions regarding changes in their local economy under irrigation. Obviously, this is not such a simple change, involving large-scale institutional environments, and structural problems with professional education – which experience shows can hardly be changed at all until higher education authorities are aware, with the self-critical capacity to acknowledge the need for a change. It is definitely time to challenge the power relationships among different levels (users-agencies-funders, students-professors, designs-operators) that stand in the way of developing irrigation systems more interactively. Without this the intervention practice itself can continue to reproduce this imbalanced power relationship.Alternate abstract:In Bolivia is irrigatie van groot belang voor de landbouwproductie. Dit heeft te maken met de agro-klimatologische omstandigheden in het land. De plattelandsbevolking heeft daarom belang bij verbetering van bestaande irrigatiesystemen, of op de bouw van nieuwe systemen. Irrigatieverbeteringen en bouwprojecten staan daarom vaak boven aan op de ontwikkelingsagenda's van dorpen en (sub-)prefecturen. Het is in deze context dat de Boliviaanse overheid, gebruik makend van diverse fondsen, veel irrigatieprojecten financiert en uitvoert. Een belangrijk aspect van Boliviaanse irrigatiesystemen is dat ze beheerd worden door gebruikers. De Boliviaanse regering heeft bijna nooit geld gestoken in het beheer van water en de overheid speelt maar een relatief kleine rol in het opstellen van regels voor en reguleren van lokaal waterbeheer. Verbeteringen in het irrigatiesysteem zouden daarom het huidige systeem van gebruikersbeheer in tact moeten laten. Het is belangrijk dat de verbeteringen gebaseerd worden op het (potenti{\"{e}}le) vermogen van de gebruikers het irrigatiesysteem te beheren. Dat de meeste irrigatiesystemen in Bolivia worden beheerd door de gebruikers betekent niet dat er niet van alles mis gaat. Sommige dreigingen ontstaan zelfs door nieuwe projecten, waarvan de resultaten vaak ontmoedigend zijn. Van de ontwikkelingsprojecten werd gedacht dat ze de ge{\"{i}}rrigeerde landbouw zouden verbeteren en de betrokkenheid van de boeren zouden vergroten. De ervaring leert echter dat nieuwe stelsels soms helemaal niet in gebruik worden genomen, terwijl andere nieuwe of verbeterde stelsels in een zeer slechte staat van onderhoud verkeren. In dit boek wordt onderzocht wat er misgaat. Aan de hand van vier gedetailleerde casestudies wordt bekeken hoe, in de toekomst, de irrigatie-infrastructuur en het beheer ervan verbeterd kunnen worden. De bedoeling van dit boek is de kloof te laten zien, die ontstaan is tussen aan de ene kant de critici, met hun idee{\"{e}}n over ontwerp en beheer, en aan de andere kant de ingenieurs, die vaak hun eigen – beperkte- visie op het ontwerpen en functioneren van een infrastructuur aan anderen willen opleggen, zonder zich daarbij te bekommeren om de behoeften en voorkeuren van de gebruikers. In dit boek worden ook de voorwaarden besproken waaronder nieuwe of verbeterde irrigatiestelsels beter kunnen passen bij de bestaande waterbeheerstradities om zodoende de duurzaamheid van investeringen te vergroten. In dit onderzoek wordt in het bijzonder aandacht geschonken aan het analyseren van de verhouding van de infrastructuur tot de organisatie van het onderhoud en beheer van die infrastructuur. Toch is dit boek geen gedetailleerde technische studie naar de hydraulische kenmerken van irrigatiestelsels. Ook is het geen studie naar bestaande ontwerptradities of vooronderstellingen, noch een etnografische studie naar sociale irrigatiepraktijken en tradities. In plaats daarvan is deze studie opgezet als een beschrijving van infrastructuur, de beheersprincipes die ten grondslag liggen aan het gebruik ervan, en de benodigde ondersteunende diensten voor beiden. Ook wordt er in uitgelegd hoe boeren goed werkende en duurzame irrigatiestelsels kunnen (her)ontwerpen die aansluiten bij hun behoeften en toch nieuwe mogelijkheden bieden tot aanwending van arbeid en productieverhoging. Hoewel het grootste deel van het empirisch materiaal in dit boek zal bestaan uit de beschrijving van de infrastructuur en het ontwerp ervan, zal er steeds verwezen worden naar het productiesysteem van de boeren. Het proefschrift bestaat uit 8 hoofdstukken. In het eerste hoofdstuk worden de achtergrond van het onderzoek, het conceptuele kader en de methodologie beschreven. Ook wordt in dit hoofdstuk aandacht besteed aan een karakterisering van de agro-ecologie, agrarische en economische hervormingen, de ontwikkeling van irrigatie in Bolivia en ontwikkelingsbeleid ten aanzien van irrigatie. In hoofdstuk 2 worden de oorspronkelijke irrigatie-infrastructuur en het waterbeheer van Boliviaanse irrigatiesystemen beschreven. Deze beschrijving is bedoeld om de casestudies beter te begrijpen. De hoofdstukken 3 tot 6 bevatten de empirische gegevens van de 4 casestudies. In hoofdstuk 7 worden de bevindingen geanalyseerd, waarbij de nadruk ligt op de geschiktheid van de infrastructuur voor waterbeheer. Tenslotte worden in hoofdstuk 8 de conclusies van het onderzoek gepresenteerd. In het eerste hoofdstuk worden verschillende conceptuele benaderingen besproken, die gebruikt zijn om het ontwerpen van irrigatiestelsels te begrijpen. Het conceptuele kader van dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de overtuiging dat irrigatietechnologie zowel een sociale als een technische aangelegenheid is, en dat irrigatie sociale voorschriften voor gebruik in zich draagt. Er wordt uitgegaan van de gedachte dat het ontwerp van irrigatiesystemen twee kanten heeft. - de inhoudelijke kant, betreffende de volgende elementen: ontwerp van de infrastructuur, ontwerp van waterbeheer in de toekomst en ontwerp van een systeem voor de landbouwproductie binnen een irrigatie-infrastructuur.- de procesmatige kant, waarin onderzocht wordt hoe beslissingen genomen worden. Er wordt aandacht geschonken aan de partijen die bij het proces betrokken zijn: wat is hun positie, welke rol spelen ze in de uitvoering van het ontwerp? Of het nou gaat over het ontwerpen en aanleggen van een geheel nieuw systeem neerzet, of om het verbeteren van een bestaand systeem, deze twee kanten zijn onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden. Om programmatische en methodologische redenen zal in dit onderzoek toch de nadruk komen te liggen op de inhoudelijke kant. Specifieker zal het gaan over het ontwerp van stelsels en over voorgestelde veranderingen zich verhouden tot de organisatie van de landbouw productie en de bredere sociale organisatie. Het onderzoek concentreert zich op de ´geschiktheid´ van de technologie. De vraag is niet alleen of een systeem geschikt is en aansluit bij de vraag van dat moment, maar ook hoe (en of) boeren zelf een systeem kunnen (her)ontwerpen, om het zelf te beheren in overeenstemming met hun lokale praktijken en tradities. Om de operationele, materi{\"{e}}le en productieve dimensies te belichten, zijn de volgende onderzoeksgebieden tussen infrastructuur en beheer te onderscheiden: 1. Operationele geschiktheid (of bedieningsgemak) van de infrastructuur voor het beheer (gerelateerd aan de werking en de bediening van een stelsel). Het gaat hier om de institutionele kenmerken van de gebruiksvoorschriften die besloten liggen in ontwerpen ter verbetering van (onderdelen van) het systeem in relatie tot het aanwezige vermogen het systeem te beheren. Hierbij ligt de nadruk op de rechten, regels en het werk dat nodig is voor de aanvoer en de verdeling van water en zelfbestuur. 2. De geschiktheid van de infrastructuur voor het beheer op het niveau van de techniek. Het betreft hier de technische kenmerken van het de vernieuwde fysieke infrastruktuur in relatie tot het beheer ervan. En dan in het bijzonder waar het de hydraulische en contructietechnische geschiktheid betreft in relatie tot de specifieke kenmerken van de omgeving waarin het stelsel gebruikt wordt en in relatie tot de onderhoudsvereisten.  3. De productie-technische geschiktheid van het stelsel in relatie tot het beheer ervan. Het gaat hier over de manier waarop verbeteringen in de gewasproductie samenhangen met verschillende beheersmogelijkheden en onderhoudsvereisten. In het tweede hoofdstuk worden twee belangrijke aspecten van het onderzoekskader besproken: de traditionele infrastructuur en de aanwezige irrigatiebeheersvormen van kleine boeren. De onderwerpen die aan bod komen zijn: de bestaande irrigatiesystemen in Bolivia in het algemeen en meer in het bijzonder de uitgebreide ervaringen uit de casestudies. De irrigatieprojecten werden in deze casestudies allemaal ontwikkeld om bestaande systemen te verbeteren. In hoofdstuk 3 t/m 6 worden de casestudies van externe pogingen irrigatiesystemen te verbeteren besproken in respectievelijk Condorchinoka, San Roque Capellan{\'{i}}a, Naranjos Margen Izquierda en Caigua. In elk afzonderlijk hoofdstuk worden de voorgestelde verbeteringen van de infrastructuur en het waterbeheer beschreven en geanalyseerd en gecontrasteerd met de bestaande praktijken en tradities van de boeren zelf en hun eigen idee{\"{e}}n met betrekking tot waterbeheer. De kenmerken van de landbouwproductie worden benoemd, waarbij de nadruk ligt op hoe verbeteringen in irrigatie het productiesysteem zullen veranderen. Vervolgens wordt het irrigatieontwerpproces geanalyseerd. De casestudies liggen ten grondslag aan een analyse waarin gekeken wordt of de betreffende infrastructuur geschikt is om in aanmerking te komen voor beheer door de gebruikers. Deze analyse geschiedt op basis van de drie eerder genoemde concepten. In hoofdstuk 7 komen de 4 casestudies samen. Er wordt hierin een analyse gemaakt, wederom op basis van de eerder genoemde concepten, van verbeterde infrastructuren in relatie tot gebruikersbeheer. Het eerste concept (de operationele geschiktheid (of het bedieningsgemak)) van de infrastructuur) bevat de volgende drie punten: a. Projectvoorstellen voor toekomstig waterbeheer en de reactie van de gebruikers daarop. b. Het aanwezige vermogen om de verbeterde infrastructuur te bedienen en onderhouden, en deze taken goed te organiseren. c. Vereisten voor het bedienen en onderhouden van het nieuwe stelsel, uitgaande van beheer door gebruikers. Het onderzoek naar de technische geschiktheid van het stelsel ten opzichte van het aanwezige beheersvermogen omvat de volgende onderdelen: a. De grootste infrastructurele problemen van het stelsel. Hierbij zal gelet worden op zowel de hydraulische geschiktheid van (de onderdelen van het) irrigatiestelsel als op de kwaliteit van de constructie met betrekking tot de geschiktheid voor gebruikersbeheer en –onderhoud. b. De grootste ontwerp- en contructie-technische belemmeringen voor wat betreft gebruikersbeheer. c. De belangrijkste technische ontwerp en constructie-technische criteria die van invloed zijn voor het beheer. Tot slot worden de gevolgen voor het beheer van de verbeterde infrastructuur met betrekking tot de gewasproductie onderzocht. De volgende aspecten komen aan bod: a. Productiescenario's met betrekking tot boeren productiestrategie{\"{e}}n.  b. De effecten van verbeterde infrastructuren op de landbouwproductie. c. Inkomensgevolgen op het niveau van het huishouden en de beschikbaarheid van arbeid. In hoofdstuk 7 wordt ook het hele ontwerpproces geanalyseerd. De volgende aspecten spelen hierbij een rol: a. Hoe ontwikkelingelingsprojecten door hun aanpak de ontwikkeling van gebruikersbeheer belemmeren. b. Het gebrek aan communicatie tussen gebruikers en ingenieurs tijdens het ontwerpproces. c. Gevolgen van het gebruik van criteria op basis waarvan projecten worden goed (of af-) gekeurd. De analyse van de operationele geschiktheid (het bedieningsgemak) van het ontwerp voor het beheer leidt tot de conclusie dat waterrechten e{\'{e}}n van de sociale kwesties is die ingenieurs wel degelijk betrekken in hun ontwerpen, zij het meestal op een vrij instrumentele manier. Ook behoort het opzetten van gebruikersorganisaties vaak tot de standaard ingredi{\"{e}}nten van het ontwerp en de uitvoering van irrigatieprojecten. Dit gebeurt echter vaak volgens standaard procedures en richtlijnen, uitgaande van een model organisatie met een voorgeschreven interne structuur. Deze nieuwe organisaties worden vaak opgezet en bestaan naast de reeds aanwezige waterbeheersorganisaties, hetgeen de reden is dat ze niet functioneren en door de gebruikers zelf genegeerd worden. Hierdoor komen ook de nieuw verordonneerde wetten en regels niet bij de gebruikers terecht. Hierbij dient vermeld dat irrigatiesystemen veelal georganiseerd worden in overeenstemming met de voorschriften voor waterverdeling en met de voorschriften voor het onderhoud van de infrastructuur. Het bedienen van het systeem is meestal vrij eenvoudig. De bijbehorende verantwoordelijkheden worden niet omschreven als ingewikkelde activiteiten, en zijn niet vastgelegd, dus hebben ze geen gevolgen voor de organisatiestructuur. De wijze van waterverdeling heeft meer invloed op de gekozen beheersvorm. Dit is de reden dat de aanwezige waterverdelingsautoriteiten doorgaans de bedieningstaken er ook bij nemen. Vaak wordt de bediening van het stelsel ook door gebruikers zelf gedaan. Een nieuw aspect dat uit het onderzoek naar voren komt is, dat de organisatie van een verbeterd irrigatiesysteem te maken krijgt met nieuwe voorschriften en eisen ten aanzien van onderhoud, waar dan weer nieuwe kennis, arbeid en kapitaal voor nodig zijn. Indien kapitaal, kennis en arbeid niet in voldoende mate voorhanden zijn, dreigt het systeem uit elkaar te vallen. Bij het opstellen van de plannen ter verbetering moet hier rekening mee gehouden worden. De organisaties, maar ook de gebruikers, moeten steeds bij het overleg betrokken worden. De bedieningsvoorschriften voor de verbeterde irrigatiesystemen in kwestie, hangen samen met de manier waarop de verdeling van het water plaatsvindt. Bij de onderzochte systemen wordt het water in het droge seizoen bij toerbeurt geleverd, waarbij de verschillende irrigeerders om de beurt gebruik maken van {\'{e}}{\'{e}}n en dezelfde waterstroom. Dit is gedaan om ten bate van de inzichtelijkheid van het systeem, maar ook omdat er maar weinig water is. Voorschriften voor de bediening betreffen dus alleen regulering en waterbeheersing. De regulering houdt het openen en sluiten van sluizen, verdeelwerken en inlaten in, op de verschillende plekken – relatief eenvoudig werk dat door bijna iedereen gedaan kan worden. De nieuwe verbeterde systemen zijn vaak ontworpen om de benodigde waterbeheersingsmaatregelen tot een minimum te bepreken. Dat de meeste gebruikers toch veel aan waterbeheersing moeten doen, heeft te maken met het feit dat ontwerp en constructie nogal eens zwakke plekken vertonen. Het gaat hier in het bijzonder om de sifons, de inlaten en het feit dat kanalen ondergedimensioneerd zijn. Alhoewel de gebruikers over voldoende kennis beschikken, betekent het wel extra werk voor hen. Een grondige analyse van alternatieve methoden voor de distributie van water, in relatie tot de irrigatie-infrastructuur, is onontbeerlijk, zo blijkt uit de bevindingen. Het is vooral van belang dat de nieuw ontworpen kunstwerken en het stelsel als geheel aansluiten bij bestaande waterver delingspraktijken. De waterverdelingsmethode (continu of niet; {\'{e}}{\'{e}}n of meerdere stromen) moet daarom duidelijk van tevoren omschreven moet zijn. De gekozen verdelingsmethode heeft weer gevolgen voor manieren van waterbeheersing en daarmee ook voor de benodigde capaciteit van de irrigatie-infrastructuur. De wijze van verdelen bepaalt ook mede de keuze voor de verdeelen meetwerken: permanent of tijdelijk, wel of in het stelsel opgenomen reservoirs, soort en hoeveelheid meetpunten{\ldots}enz. De studies laten zien dat het onderhoud van de vernieuwde stelsels het grootste knelpunt vormt voor het beheer van de stelsels. De gebruikers ontbreekt het in het algemeen aan de kennis die noodzakelijk is voor het onderhoud van de verbeterde infrastructuur. Vanzelfsprekend vraagt een verbeterd systeem om een gewijzigde aanpak van de gebruikers, om de nieuwe technologie goed te kunnen toepassen. Als de gebruikers niet in staat zijn aan de nieuwe eisen te voldoen (dit staat nog los van hun mogelijkheden, gebrek aan kennis, middelen of niet werkende apparatuur), dan vormt dat een bedreiging voor de duurzaamheid van het systeem en, daarmee samenhangend, het vermogen om de infrastructuur door de gebruikers te laten beheren. Dit roept nieuwe conceptuele en methodologische uitdagingen op, en vraagt aan om een verandering in de houding van degenen die zich beroepsmatig met boeren-irrigatie bezig houden. Wat levert een analyse op van de technische geschiktheid van de nieuwe stelsels voor beheer door gebruikers? De belangrijkste oorzaak van de beperkte hydraulische en constructie-technische geschiktheid van de nieuwe stelsels heeft te maken het feit dat de gebruikte ontwerp– en constructiecriteria niet zijn toegesneden op de specifieke kenmerken van de Andes. De redenen voor ongeschiktheid kunnen in twee groepen verdeeld worden: 1. Ontwerp- en constructiecriteria die de bediening van het stelsel belemmeren. 2. Ontwerp- en constructiecriteria die de hydraulische en constructieve geschiktheid van het stelsel beperken. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat, wat het eerste punt betreft, alle irrigatiesystemen onderdelen hebben die weliswaar vernieuwd zijn, maar die niet naar behoren functioneren. Dit leidt tot verkeerd gebruik van deze onderdelen. Bij onjuist gebruik zijn voortdurend reparaties nodig. Wanneer de vereiste kennis om een onderdeel te repareren bij de gebruikers ontbreekt, worden de betreffende delen van het systeem verlaten of vernietigd. De onderdelen werken meestal slecht door relatief simpele ontwerp en contructie fouten die voortkomen uit het feit dat ingenieurs geen rekening houden met de specifieke karakteristieken van het Andesgebied. Klaarblijkelijk zijn technische zaken die het goede functioneren kunnen belemmeren vaak niet belangrijk genoeg om te (her)overwegen of te overdenken. De werking van onderdelen van het systeem hangt ook af van de kwaliteit van de materialen die gebruikt zijn. In de meeste cases die in dit boek beschreven zijn, komen problemen met de werking van stelsels voort uit de slechte kwaliteit van de gebruikte bouwmaterialen.  De slechte werking van de apparatuur ligt soms ook aan de slecht gekozen locatie, vooral waar het betreft de inlaat. De casestudies laten zien dat ontwerpers vaak geen rekening houden met het feit dat de verschillende onderdelen van een stelsel deel uitmaken van een netwerk. Dat netwerk moet een samenhangend en soepel geheel zijn. Een van de grootste gebreken is de neiging ge{\"{i}}soleerd en tamelijk ad hoc te ontwerpen en bouwen, zonder rekening te houden met de andere onderdelen die deel uitmaken van het irrigatiesysteem in de lokale setting. Alle bovengenoemde punten zorgen ervoor dat de onderdelen minder goed werken, en dat er soms aanpassingen, veranderingen en verbouwingen nodig zijn. Het lijkt er daardoor op of er aan het huidige traject van (het bouwen van) irrigatieprojecten een fase toegevoegd zou moeten worden., die van de afstemming. Zulke ‘afstemmingsreparaties' kosten echter geld dat meestal niet voorhanden is, waardoor de gebruikers de facto worden opgezadeld met de verantwoordelijkheid het stelsel te her-ontwerpen zodat het wel functioneert. Dit is waarom het beter is de noodzaak tot afstemming na afronding van het project te voorkomen. De casestudies hebben het belang laten zien van 1. De interactie tussen gebruiker en ontwerper tijdens de ontwerpfase, ertoe leidend dat beide partijen verantwoordelijkheid dragen voor het eindresultaat. 2. Serieuze, bescheiden ontwerpen waarbij de nadruk niet alleen ligt op technische en mechanische ontwerpcriteria, maar waarbij, dan al, afstemming plaatsvindt met de gebruikers die de voorgestelde infrastructuur langdurig moeten kunnen gebruiken. 3. Het in dienst nemen van opzichters die oog hebben voor de technische specificaties en die de gebruikers helpen het constructie proces in de gaten te houden. De analyse van de sociale gebruiksvoorwaarden nodig om een stelsel op een hydraulisch en constructie-technisch geschikte manier te laten functioneren laten zien dat de grootste belemmeringen liggen op het gebied van het onderhoud, en niet op het gebied van de bediening. Het probleem is dat de ingenieurs zich tijdens het ontwerpproces nooit hebben afgevraagd of (de onderdelen van) het irrigatiesysteem onderhouden kunnen worden door de gebruikers. Als er rekening was gehouden met de gebruikers, dan zouden de ontwerpers heldere en eenvoudige criteria opgesteld hebben. Dit betekent dat het vermogen het systeem te beheren, en vooral te onderhouden, sterk be{\"{i}}nvloed wordt door zijn intrinsieke eigenschappen. Ingenieurs ontwerpen en bouwen zonder rekening te houden met de eisen die door de gebruikers gesteld worden. De lokale voorwaarden voor beheer en de specifieke eigenschappen van het gebied vragen om een nieuwe benadering. Belangrijke ingredi{\"{e}}nten van zo een nieuwe benadering zijn: onderhoudsgemak, duurzaamheid, functionaliteit, bedieningsgemak, en veiligheid. Op dit moment worden deze punten niet bij het ontwerp betrokken. Daarom zouden de benadering en het ontwerp waarmee civiele ingenieurs en agronomen werken, heroverwogen, bevraagd, en veranderd moeten worden. Ook zou de totstandkoming van irrigatieprojecten in Bolivia aan een onderzoek onderworpen moeten worden. Door de wijze waarop dat nu gebeurt zijn ingenieurs niet aansprakelijk voor de behaalde resultaten. Bovendien kunnen aannemers de technische specificaties omzeilen, worden dienstverlenende instellingen aangemoedigd om onverantwoord te werk te gaan, en worden de opzichters aangespoord tot slordigheid. Analyse van de geschiktheid van de nieuwe stelsels voor de gewasproductie in relatie tot het beheer ervan leidt tot de conclusie, dat vernieuwde irrigatiesystemen daadwerkelijk meer water opleveren. De boeren hebben hun productieplannen hierdoor kunnen aanpassen (meer ge{\"{i}}rrigeerd land, nieuwe gewassen, betere oogst) en hebben meer inkomsten. Zulke verbeteringen zijn veelal op het conto te schrijven van van de afzonderlijke gebruikers, die resultaten behaalden door de inzet van hun eigen doelen en middelen. Er is nooit enige institutionele steun geweest (uit de beschreven casestudies) ter bevordering van die de landbouwproductie, waardoor de gebruikers de grotere beschikbaarheid van water zouden kunnen benutten voor het optimaliseren van de gewasproductie strategie{\"{e}}n en het verhogen van hun oogsten. De casestudies laten zien dat zelfs als het inkomen groter is geworden, de gebruikers zich nog steeds niet de investeringen die nodig zijn voor het onderhoud van de vernieuwde stelsels kunnen veroorloven. De gebruikers komen dus, zelfs in de nieuwe situatie, nog steeds geld tekort voor het onderhoud. Geen enkele infrastructuur overleeft zonder onderhoud, en daar zijn geld en arbeid voor nodig. De geschiktheid van irrigatiestelsels op het platteland hangt af van hoe de ge{\"{i}}rrigeerde landbouw benaderd wordt tijdens de verschillende fasen van een interventie project. In het verleden is dit vaak niet adequaat omgegaan. Voor het opstellen van richtlijnen voor investering in irrigatieprojecten, is verder onderzoek noodzakelijk. Dan zouden de projecten op lokaal niveau invloed kunnen uitoefenen in de besluitvorming, en zelfs een stem kunnen krijgen in besluiten en plannen die op nationaal niveau genomen worden. Betere stelsels die dus minder geld voor onderhoud van de gebruikers zelf vragen en met meer positief effect op de lokale leefomstandigheden zullen ervoor zorgen dat de gebruikers beter in hun levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien, terwijl ook aan de onderhoudseisen voldaan wordt. Dit alles geeft de noodzaak aan tot het opstellen van institutioneel beleid, niet alleen voor de uitvoering van irrigatieprojecten, maar ook om gebruikers te helpen hun landbouwproductie te plannen, zodat de verscheidene ecologische gebieden van het land hun eigen ontwikkelingsplannen kunnen opstellen. Dat zou weer kunnen bijdragen aan regionale en nationale plannen en aan een herziening van de landbouw, zodat die ecologisch, sociaal en economisch duurzamer wordt. Bij wijze van conclusie kan gesteld worden dat de drie basisconcepten met elkaar verweven zijn. Het is van het grootste belang ze alledrie te betrekken bij het ontwerpen van verbeterde irrigatiesystemen die onder het beheer van kleine boeren vallen, waardoor ze langer meegaan. Analyse van het ontwerpproces laat zien dat het vermogen de infrastructuur te beheren, deels het resultaat zijn van ingenomen stellingen, bepaalde besluiten, en van de opstelling van de partijen betrokken bij het ontwikkelingsproces. Hoe de verschillende partijen zich opstellen en gedragen hangt weer af van hun sociaal-economische, politieke en culturele context, alsmede van hun vermogen andere spelers bij het ‘eigen project' te betrekken. In elk van de case-studies hebben de besluiten en het gedrag van de verschillende belanghebbenden de richting en aard van het ontwikkelingsproces be{\"{i}}nvloed. Bovendien heeft elk project een eigen proces gevolgd, gevormd door de economische, sociale, politieke en culturele setting. De verschillende processen laten vele zwakke plekken zien, bijvoorbeeld onvoldoende kennis van het ontwerp in zijn geheel of gebrek aan communicatie over en weer met gebruikers. Dit soort onderzoek kan een startpunt zijn voor het ontwikkelen van nieuwe concepten en methoden die een bijdrage kunnen leveren aan de ontwerpprocessen. Zo komt er een eind aan het slaafs uitvoeren van standaard protocollen en blauwdrukken.. We zouden moeten onthouden dat de gebruikers hun eigen systeem moeten kunnen beheren. Daarom moeten ze betrokken worden bij de beslissingen die van invloed zijn op hun lokale irrigatie-economie. De beoogde veranderingen zijn niet eenvodig, en behelzen niet alleen de bredere institutionele context, maar ook de structurele problemen in het irrigatie-onderwijs. De ervaring leert dat veranderingen bijna onmogelijk zijn tot op het moment dat de onderwijsautoriteiten ervan doordrongen raken, met de zelfkritiek die nodig is om in te zien dat veranderingen noodzakelijk zijn. Het wordt hoog tijd de machtsverhoudingen eens flink op te schudden (tussen ontwerpers en gebruikers, tussen studenten en docenten). Irrigatiesystemen zouden dan meer interactief tot stand komen. Als dit niet gebeurt, is er en risico dat ongelijke machtsverhoudingen door de aard het het proces van de interventie z{\'{e}}lf gereproduceerd worden.},

abstract = {This paper studies primary canals of three traditional irrigation systems in the southern plains of Nepal. It offers a scientific interpretation of the indigenous technology applied to the systems, which facilitates to use the same channel network for irrigation, drainage and flood management. The flood management technology of the farmers by diverting as much discharge as possible to the field channels results in the reduction of discharge towards the downstream part of the main channel. It is depicted in the simulation study that uses the river analysis program HEC-RAS 4.0. A cascade of weirs is found to be the most cost effective and user-friendly option to upgrade these systems preserving the existing irrigation, drainage as well as flood management functions. This study suggests that the conventional irrigation design principles should be applied very cautiously with full knowledge of the existing socio-institutional setting, hydro-ecological regime and indigenous technology for upgrading any traditional irrigation system successfully. The indigenous flood management technology strengthens the emerging concept that the floods in the Ganges plain are to be managed, not controlled.},

abstract = {The use of polluted water to irrigate is an increasing problem in the developing world. Lebanon is a case in point, with heavily polluted irrigation waters, particularly in the Litani River Basin. This study evaluated the potential health risks of irrigating vegetables (radishes, parsley, onions, and lettuce) using three water sources (groundwater, river water, and treated wastewater) and three irrigation methods (drip, sprinkler, and surface) over two growing seasons in 2019 and 2020. Water, crop, and soil samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters, pathogens, and metals (Cu, Cd, Ni, Cr, and Zn). In addition, the bioaccumulation factor, estimated dietary intakes, health risk index, and target hazard quotients were calculated to assess the health risk associated with metal contamination. The study showed that, for water with less than 2 log E. coli CFU/100 mL, no pathogens (Escherichia coli, salmonella, parasite eggs) were detected in irrigated vegetables, irrespective of the irrigation method. With over 2 log E. coli CFU/100 mL in the water, 8.33{\%} of the sprinkler-and surface-irrigated vegetables, and 2.78{\%} of the drip-irrigated root crops (radishes and onions), showed some degree of parasitic contamination. E. coli appeared only on root crops when irrigated with water having over 3 log CFU/100 mL. The concentrations of most metals were significantly lower than the safe limits of the FAO/WHO of the Food Standards Programme Codex, except for zinc and chromium. The trends in the bioaccumulation factor and the estimated dietary intakes of metals were in the order of Cu {\textless} Cd {\textless} Ni {\textless} Cr {\textless} Zn. The target hazard quotient values for all metals were lower than 1.0. Under trial conditions, the adoption of drip irrigation with water with less than 3 log E. coli CFU/100 mL proved to be safe, even for vegetables consumed raw, except for root crops such as onions and radishes that should not be irrigated with water having over 2 log E. coli CFU/100 mL. Treated wastewater had no adverse effect on vegetable quality compared to vegetables irrigated with other water sources. These results support efforts to update the Lebanese standards for water reuse in agriculture; standards proposed in 2011 by the FAO, and currently being reviewed by the Lebanese Institution of Standards. This research will inform a sustainable water management policy aimed at protecting the Litani River watershed by monitoring water quality.},

abstract = {Groundwater irrigation can dramatically affect agricultural production and productivity. Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30{\%} of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries. We find no discernible impact on household expenditure. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In olive (Olea europaea L), deficit irrigation (DI) has proven to be an effective management strategy to improve water productivity (WP, yield per unit of water used), particularly under localized irrigation. However, despite the significant research efforts made to adapt irrigation programs to each particular cropping environment, little has been done to study the response of tree root systems to DI. The present paper analyzes the effect of water stress on olive root morphology and studies olive ideotypes best suited to DI. To do so, the results of a two-year field experiment using two irrigation treatments, a well-watered control irrigation (CI) and a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), are combined with simulations using a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) model. Results of the field experiment show that olive root systems forage for water resources when RDI is imposed, i.e. they try to maximize the soil area explored. However, simulations indicate that under DI, foraging might not be the best strategy. Instead, a root system that tends to concentrate new growth inside the wet bulb will increase daily net assimilation (An) by up to 16{\%}. The present analysis shows that tree performance under DI could be optimized to trigger a new leap in WP.},

abstract = {Potential health risks associated with water used to irrigate fresh produce are increasingly recognized worldwide, leading to the implementation of water quality standards as part of many food safety programs. These standards are generally based on the presence of the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), generic Escherichia coli; however, the persistence and potential growth of this species in the environment suggests current standards may not accurately predict health risks associated with irrigation water. In this context, we evaluated enterococci as an alternate FIB for assessing agricultural water quality under baseflow conditions, which typically coincide with peak demands for supplemental irrigation in the study area. We compared culture-based concentrations of Enterococcus to E. coli over two growing seasons at four different irrigation canals in Alberta, Canada, that historically exceed the E. coli irrigation guideline on a frequent basis. We also examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water, animal feces, and human sewage. Escherichia coli and enterococci were significantly correlated at three of the four canals, although on average, more guideline exceedances and higher mean concentrations of enterococci were reported. Specific differences in FIB dynamics were observed between canals. Most notably, enterococci concentrations were significantly higher than E. coli at one canal, while E. coli concentrations were significantly higher than enterococci at a different canal. Enterococci species distributions were markedly different between irrigation water and animal feces. Enterococci species reportedly associated with plants predominated in irrigation water, whereas these species were absent or present in very low proportions in human sewage and animal feces. Results of this study suggest the limitations of using enterococci for measuring microbial quality of irrigation water are similar to E. coli, in that risk analyses with respect to food safety may be confounded by the presence of environment-associated species and/or strains.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to monitor and assess environmental impacts of reclaimed wastewater (RW), used for irrigation of vegetable crops, on soil, crop quality and irrigation equipment. During 2013, effluents of a horizontal sub-surface flow constructed treatment wetland (TW) system, used for tertiary treatment of sanitary wastewater from a small rural municipality located in Eastern Sicily (Italy), were reused by micro-irrigation techniques to irrigate vegetable crops. Monitoring programs, based on in situ and laboratory analyses were performed for assessing possible adverse effects on water-soil-plant systems caused by reclaimed wastewater reuse. In particular, experimental results evidenced that Escherichia coli content found in RW would not present a risk for rotavirus infection following WHO (2006) standards. Irrigated soil was characterized by a certain persistence of microbial contamination and among the studied vegetable crops, lettuce responds better, than zucchini and eggplants, to the irrigation with low quality water, evidencing a bettering of nutraceutical properties and production parameters.},

abstract = {In Sri Lanka, most irrigation schemes irrigate rice and are located in the dry zone. The national annual average yield of rice is around 50 {\%} of the genetic potential. In order to improve capabilities, productivity of paddy cultivation and objective data on actual field performance are needed. The improved satellite remote sensing can now provide information on a daily basis of biomass, soil moisture and ETact with spatial resolutions of 250 m to 1000 m. The main objective of this study was to develop and introduce a cost effective performance assessment program to manage irrigation systems using satellite remote sensing, and to assess whether the results are sufficiently accurate to support the managerial decisions at all levels.The study area consists of the Uda{\_}Walawe and the Liyangastota irrigation schemes located in the South-east dry zone of Sri Lanka providing irrigation facilities for about 20000 ha of paddy. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used for computing ETact over the cropped area with MODIS images. To assess operational performance, the temporal scale for each growth stage was considered for 10 day intervals. The indicators used were: relative evapotranspiration ETact /ETpot, delivery performance ratio Vc /Vc,int, depleted fraction ETact /(Vc + P) and drainage ratio Vdr /(Vc + P) (see Table 3.2).During the wet and dry seasons, ETact fluctuated around 80 {\%} of its potential value. During the wet season, the irrigation managers delivered more irrigation water than required. Due to this excess water delivery, as well as rainwater from surrounding highland areas which also flows into the drainage canal system, the drainage ratio Vdr /(Vc + P) increased. In addition, by combining two indicators, the relative evapotranspiration ETact /ETpot and the depleted fraction ETact /(Vc + P) a new water use matrix for irrigated crops was introduced in this thesis. Based on this matrix, each 10 day interval of the growth period is positioned in one of the four zones (see Fig.6.7). Thereby, the matrix describes how effectively the irrigation manager has delivered the irrigation water to reduce crop water stress.The indicators used to assess the socio-economic irrigation performance were: grain yield Yact, water productivity WPm,ET, and price ratio Rprice. The grain yield Yact calculated for all four sub schemes ranged from 4290 to 5012 kg ha-1 which was above the estimated critical value of 4000 kg ha-1. The wet season showed higher values of the grain yield than the dry season. The seasonal average of the water productivity WPm,ET ranged from 0.82 to 0.96 kg m-3 while on 10 day intervals WPm,ET ranged from 0.37 to 1.24 kg m-3. The price ratio in Sri Lanka remained rather stable around 0.78. When the country reaches near self-sufficiency in paddy production, the market price of rice will be stable against the consumer demand and in the short run, the farmer gets a stable price. However, in the long run, neither the farmer nor the consumer would benefit.Under water stressed situations, the ETact derived from the 1000 m × 1000 m MODIS data deviated 10{\%} from those derived from the 30 m × 30 m Landsat data. However, under normal situations (i.e. ETact ≈ ETpot) this deviation was reduced to only 6{\%} and below. MODIS gives information with sufficient accuracy if the irrigated area is greater than 2000 ha.Without a comprehensive performance assessment program, field officers use their own experience and skills to control water distribution. Through this practice hardly any improvement in performance can be expected. The operational performance as well as the socio-economic performance of irrigation has to be improved. In the context of the water institutions (e.g. the Irrigation Department), the recommended strategies by the author of this thesis are: 1) introduce a performance assessment program for the irrigation schemes, with a minimum number of indicators as used in this study, 2) arrange obtaining near real-time measurements of rain fall from digital weather stations, ETact from low cost satellite data and canal flows from regular field measurements, 3) carry out GIS operations and satellite remote sensing for estimating ETact through the SEBAL approach for quantifying related parameters of the selected performance indicators, and 4) select and train staff for image processing, GIS techniques, and data processing of performance evaluations i.e. to implement the proposed program.},

abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that stream reaches are not simply gaining or losing to groundwater but are best described as a mosaic of exchanges that contrast between flowpaths of varying lengths and directions which inherently influence solute residence times. These residence times directly affect chemical speciation of solutes such as salts, nitrate, selenium, and uranium and have the opportunity to undergo microbial dissimilatory reduction in the shallow riparian zone and the deeper sub-surface. To improve water quality and the overall health of these natural systems requires engineering intervention supported by reliable data and calibrated models. A three-dimensional numerical flow model (MODFLOW-UZF2) is used to simulate unsaturated and saturated groundwater flow, with linkage to a streamflow routing model (SFR2), for a 5-km reach of the Arkansas River near Rocky Ford, Colorado. The reach-scale model provides increased discretization of previous regional-scale models developed for the Arkansas River Basin, using 50 x 50 m grid cells and dividing the Quaternary alluvium that represents the unconfined aquifer into 10 layers.  This discretization facilitates an enhanced view of groundwater pathways near the river which is essential for future solute transport evaluation and for consideration of alternative best management practices.  Model calibration is performed on hydraulic conductivity (K) in the upper three layers, K in the lower seven layers, and specific yield (Sy) of the entire aquifer by applying an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) using observed groundwater hydraulic head and stream stage data. The EnKF method accounts for uncertainty derived from field measurements and spatial heterogeneity in parameters calibrated using a Monte-Carlo based process to produce 200 realizations in comparison to error-prone measurements of hydraulic groundwater hydraulic head and stream stage as calibration targets.  The calibrated transient model produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.86 and 0.99, respectively, for the calibration and evaluation periods for calibration targets using the ensemble mean of realizations.  Realizations of calibrated parameters produced by the EnKF exhibit the equally-likely spatial distributions of aquifer flow and storage characteristics possible in the area, while MODPATH simulations display the associated groundwater flowpaths possible under such conditions.  The  mean residence time of a stream-destined fluid particle within the riparian zone was estimated as 1.8 years.  Simulated flowpaths to the stream were highly variable given different geologic conditions produced by EnKF, with flowpaths to some stream reaches differing in direction as much as approximately 90° and transit times differing sometimes by decades.  The simulated average annual groundwater return flow to the stream was 70 m3 d-1.  Simulated average annual return flow was highly variable along the study reach and ranged from -250 to a little over 250 m3 d-1 with a CV of 1.4.  The mean percentage of shallow (within the top three model layers) groundwater return flow to flow in aquifer layers beneath the stream was 27{\%} with a CV of 0.58.   Simulated groundwater flowpaths were superimposed upon a map of shallow shale units residing in the study region, demonstrating how groundwater flowpaths may interact with regional seleniferous shale layers.  Results hold major implications for biogeochemical processes occurring in the sub-surface of the riparian area and the hyporheic zone that have an important influence on solute concentrations.  Results may be used to aid decision makers in the implementation of best management practices and to further understand contaminant sources and fate.},

abstract = {Groundwater emerged as a major source of irrigation in India during the mid-1970s. However, a large expansion in well irrigation due to a massive rural electrification programme, government policies of promoting private tube well construction and large subsidies on electricity for agricultural use resulted in groundwater over-abstraction in many semi-arid and arid regions of India. In addition, most of the direct and indirect measures to regulate groundwater use have met with little success and have been largely ineffective in arresting groundwater over-exploitation. This paper reviews the institutional and market-based instruments that are now being advocated by scholars and practitioners as potential instruments for sustainable groundwater use. The review mainly focuses on research that examined the viability and impacts of establishing private and tradable water rights in groundwater and pro rata pricing of electricity for irrigation use as instruments to arrest the problems of groundwater over-exploitation in India.},

abstract = {In areas with inadequate improved water supply, irrigation water serves as an alternative water source for domestic uses in addition to its prime purpose of agricultural production. This increased water availability for the household can generate positive hygiene and health impacts, but poor irrigation water quality can be a source of domestic water contamination and can be harmful to human health. Using primary household survey data from two rural districts of Ethiopia, this study seeks to disentangle these opposite effects: the results show that irrigation is associated with poor household water quality (adjusted odds ratio 1.68, 95{\%}, CI 1.07–2.66) and a lower risk of diarrheal disease (adjusted odds ratio 2.07, 95{\%}, CI 1.24–3.44). Domestic use of irrigation water, however, does not further degrade the microbial quality of household water. On the other hand, the domestic use of irrigation water reduces the burden of water collection (p {\textless} 0.01). Providing education and training programs to foster behavioral change towards sustainable improvements in water resource management, such as the safe use of irrigation water for domestic purposes through appropriate point-of-use water treatment, would be crucial to maximize the benefits of the domestic use of irrigation water and to minimize adverse environmental and health risks.},

abstract = {Water resources allocated to the agricultural sector in the Yellow River basin are being reduced due to severe water scarcity and increased demand by the non-agricultural sectors. In large-scale irrigation districts, the application of water-saving practices, e.g., improving the canal system, using water-saving irrigation technology and adjusting cropping patterns, is required for the sustainable agricultural development and the river basin environmental equilibrium. Adopting water-saving practices leads to lowering the groundwater table and to controlling salinity impacts related to excessive irrigation. However, assessing the effects of water-saving practices on the groundwater system requires further investigation. The Jiefangzha Irrigation Scheme of the Hetao Irrigation District is used as a case study for analyzing the temporal and spatial dynamics of the groundwater table. A lumped parameter groundwater balance model has been developed with this purpose and to assess impacts of various water-saving practices. The model was calibrated with monthly datasets relative to the non-frozen periods of 1997–1999 and validated with datasets from 2000 to 2002. Results indicate that canal seepage and deep percolation account for respectively 48{\%} and 44{\%} of the annual groundwater recharge. Groundwater discharge by direct evaporation and plant roots uptake represents 82{\%} of the total annual groundwater discharge. After validation, the model was applied to assess the impacts of various canal and farm irrigation water-saving practices. It was observed that improvements in the canal system (e.g., canal lining, upgrading the hydraulic regulation and control structures, improving delivery schedules) might lower the groundwater table by 0.28–0.48m, depending upon the level of implementation of these measures. Higher declines of the groundwater table are predicted when water-saving technologies are applied at both the canal and the farm systems. That decline of the water table favours salinity control and reduces capillary rise, thus reducing the groundwater evaporation and uptake by plant roots; that reduction may attain 128mm. However, predictions may change depending on the way how water-saving measures are applied, which may be different of assumptions made; therefore, there is the need to perform a follow-up of the interventions in order to update predictions. Results indicate the need for appropriate research leading to improved irrigation management when the decline of the groundwater level will reduce groundwater contribution to vegetation growth.},

The objectives of the study were to analyse the socio-economic features of the smallholder maize farmer and further to examine the performance of irrigation schemes located in the former homelands in the Eastern Cape Province. One hundred farmers comprising of thirty (30) homestead gardeners and seventy (70) smallholder irrigators were interviewed using a multistage sampling technique, structured questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic background of these farmers, data on production level, productivity in terms of costs and returns were also collected. Descriptive statistics such as means, percentages, frequency distributions and tables, as well as stochastic frontier model were used in analyzing the objectives. Results from the socio-economic features of the area were discussed with the use of descriptive statistics and were discussed. The Stochastic Frontier Model revealed the significant impact of the program on participating farmers, highlighting the significance of irrigation schemes to these smallholder farmer and other productive factors. While overall production and productivity remain low, triggering a hyperinflationary situation due to supply constraints, practical implications for agribusinesses are not uncommon.},

Representative sites with high potential for irrigation development were selected from each of the four climatic types in the country. Cropping calendars were developed based on evapotranspiration and rainfall patterns. The CROPWAT program was used to determine the net irrigation requirement, from which the irrigation diversion requirements were derived based on estimated irrigation efficiencies. Recently published climate projections using the representative concentration pathways were used as climate change scenarios. Results of this study showed that the CROPWAT estimates of evapotranspiration were satisfactorily calibrated and validated using the eddy covariance methods. Climate change could lead to a significant increase in diversion water requirement. The increase in diversion water requirement was projected to reach + 43{\%} during dry years, + 32{\%} during normal years, and + 42{\%} during wet years. A favorable reduction in diversion water requirement due to timely occurrence of rainfall was however observed at the site with distinct wet and dry season during dry years (up to − 7{\%}), normal years (up to − 11{\%}), and wet years (up to − 12{\%}). The cropping patterns varied within and across climate types. The projected estimates of diversion water requirements generated in this study could be used for irrigation system planning and development particularly for assessing water storage requirements and design irrigable areas. Results could also be used as part of planning and design criteria for dams and reservoirs and thereby contribute to climate proofing of irrigation systems. The application of methods developed in this study for estimating diversion water requirements with the incorporation of climate change may be extended to other parts of the country and in other parts of the world for a more climate-resilient water resources planning.},

@article{Giordano2006,
abstract = {Irrigation management transfer (IMT) served as the cornerstone of the research agenda of the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) and later, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) for nearly a decade. The research theme arose for IWMI in response to the growing evidence of under-performance by publicly owned irrigation schemes and widespread belief that the transfer of management responsibilities to farmer organizations could improve the management of irrigation systems and make irrigated agriculture more productive and sustainable. IIMI/IWMI contributions to the topic included literature reviews and analyses of experiences and impacts of past IMT processes, advice to policymakers in planning and implementing IMT, and the development of generic IMT guidelines and technical support for governments implementing IMT programs. The purpose of this paper is to summarize IIMI/IWMI's past research and interventions related to irrigation management transfer and to document, to the extent possible, the academic, policy, and technical outcomes of these efforts. The application of a range of direct and indirect measurement techniques suggests an overall positive contribution from IWMI to IMT theory and application. Bibliometric and webmetric analyses suggest a large and continuing demand for IWMI research products on IMT. Direct and indirect data sources also indicate that IWMI policy and operational level interventions have in general contributed positively to IMT decision-making and action, both nationally through action research projects as well as regionally and globally, through the development of generic IMT guidelines. Finally, the continued demand for IWMI involvement in IMT action research serves as an important indicator of IWMI's past contributions.},

abstract = {The systems of trickle irrigation offer the potential influential irrigation to increase crop yields and have been proven reasonable according to the engineering and agricultural opinion particularly in barren areas. Trickle irrigation systems that have been offered comparatively lately in Arab countries have demonstrated to save huge amounts of water and enhance crop yield. The computational program (Trickle Irrigation System Design, TISD) connected with the economic procedures were used to research the environmental and economic conditions of the agriculture system. The conditions of environment comprised the type of soil, the topography of land, the climate areas, the water quantum and quality, and the dimensions of land. The conditions of economic included the interest rates of nominal and real, the principal price of land, and the rates of labor and energy escalation. The research deemed the ratio of B/C indicating the effects of environmental and economic parameters applying the system of trickle irrigation. The research presented the crop rotation of tomato-sesame as a line-source, and the point-source was represented by citrus trees. The research results revealed a significant impact on the ratio of B/C for the parameters; soil type, land topography, and water quality. The other parameters evidenced a variety impacts among considerable, small, and negligible on the B/C ratio. The study represents a worthy perception for institutional considerations in agricultural economics.},

abstract = {Deterioration of groundwater quality due to anthropogenic activities is increasing at an alarming rate in most parts of the Punjab, but limited work has been carried out on groundwater quality and monitoring. This paper highlights the groundwater quality and compares its suitability for drinking and irrigation purpose in Malwa region, a southwestern part of Punjab. The Malwa region makes up the most cultivated area of Punjab with high consumption of pesticides and fertilizers. Twenty-four water samples representing groundwater sources were collected and analyzed for almost all major cations, anions and other physicochemical parameters. Analytical results of physicochemical analysis showed majority of the samples above the permissible limits of the Indian standards. The groundwater of the study area was very hard and the relative abundance of major cations and anions was Na⁺ {\textgreater} Ca²⁺ {\textgreater} Mg²⁺ {\textgreater} K⁺ and HCO(3)  {\textgreater} SO₄ ² {\textgreater} Cl. Fluoride content was higher than permissible limit in 75 {\%} of the samples. The mean concentration of arsenic in groundwater was 9.37 and 11.01µg/L during summer and winter season, respectively. The parameters like sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage (Na{\%}) revealed good quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes, whereas magnesium ratio and corrosivity ratio values showed that water is not suitable for agriculture and domestic use. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater was Ca-Mg-HCO(3) and Ca-Mg-SO₄-Cl. Chloro alkaline indices 1 and 2 indicated that reverse ion exchange is dominant in the region. The samples fall in rock dominance and evaporation dominance fields as indicated by Gibbs diagram. The saturation index shows that all the water samples were supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals. This work thus concludes that groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for domestic and agricultural uses. It is recommended to carry out a continuous water quality monitoring program and development of effective management practices for utilization of water resources.},

abstract = {Turkey is located within semi-arid climate zone and large portion of the country experience water deficits. Thus, efficient water use has become a significand issue in agricultural practices. Current global warming and climate change have aggravated such deficiencies. Konya province is located right at the center of Central Anatolia region and mostly groundwater is used in irrigations. Excessive groundwater withdrawals drop groundwaters levels and also increase energy costs. Although farmers pay quite high sums for energy, they were not using water efficiently and thus were not able to get desired benefits from the irrigations. In this study, irrigation practices of an irrigation cooperative were assessed and compared with optimum irrigation programs created through IRSIS irrigation scheduling software. It was concluded that all irrigation practices of the region were wrong and way behind the optimum ones.},

abstract = {The Kabul River basin (KRB) of Afghanistan, a lifeline of around 10 million people, has multiplicity of governance, management, and development-related challenges leading to inequity, inadequacy, and unreliability of irrigation water distribution. Prior to any uplifting intervention, there is a need to evaluate the performance of irrigation system on a long term basis to identify the existing bottlenecks. Although there are several indicators available for the performance evaluation of the irrigation schemes, we used the coefficient of variation (CV) of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in space (basin, sub-basin, and provincial level), relative evapotranspiration (RET), and temporal CV of RET, to assess the equity, adequacy, and reliability of water distribution, respectively, from 2003 to 2013. The ETa was estimated through a surface energy balance system (SEBS) algorithm and the ETa estimates were validated using the advection aridity (AA) method with a R2 value of 0.81 and 0.77 at Nawabad and Sultanpur stations, respectively. The global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used as main inputs to the SEBS. Results show that the mean seasonal sub-based RET values during summer (May–September) (0.37 ± 0.06) and winter (October–April) (0.40 ± 0.08) are below the target values (RET ≥ 0.75) during 2003–2013. The CV of the mean ETa, within sub-basins and provinces for the entire study period, has an equitable distribution of water from October–January (0.09 ± 0.04), whereas the highest inequity (0.24 ± 0.08) in water distribution is during early summer. The range of the CV of the mean ETa (0.04–0.06) on a monthly and seasonal basis shows the unreliability of water supplies in several provinces or sub-basins. The analysis of the temporal CV of mean RET highlights the unreliable water supplies across the entire basin. The maximum ETa during the study period was estimated for the Shamal sub-basin (552 ± 43 mm) while among the provinces, Kunar experienced the highest ETa (544 ± 39 mm). This study highlights the dire need for interventions to improve the irrigation performance in time and space. The proposed methodology can be used as a framework for monitoring and implementing water distribution plans in future.},

abstract = {Increasing agricultural productivity through irrigation technologies is recognized as an effective way to improve smallholders' livelihoods and food security in developing countries. However, most smallholder farmers do not have access to irrigation technologies. Using a double-bounded contingent valuation survey data from smallholders in Ethiopia and probit and bivariate probit models, this paper analyzes smallholder farmers' demand for agricultural water lifting technologies (WLTs) and the factors affecting the demand for these technologies. Assessment of farmers' preferences among three water lifting technologies available in local markets (motorized pump, rope and washer and pulley) show that farmers prefer motorized pumps to pulley or rope and washer technologies. Use of motorized pumps is more efficient and save labour than pulley or rope and washer technologies. However, results show that smallholders are constrained by inadequate access to financing options to adopt more efficient and labour-saving water lifting technology and hence operate below the production possibility frontier. Enhanced access to finance could help ease this constraint and allow smallholders to acquire more efficient irrigation technologies, enhance adoption and improve productivity. With a growing population pressure and land fragmentation in rural Ethiopia, the livelihoods of smallholders depend mainly on the meagre land endowment they possess. Increasing the productivity of land using yield enhancing technologies, particularly multiple cropping per year via small-scale irrigation is key to improve their livelihoods. Targeted interventions are thus warranted to mitigate the key adoption constraints such as improving access to credit and technical know-how of smallholders.},

Reliable assessment of waterlogged areas forms a crucial element in the irrigation command area development program. Space borne multispectral satellite data is successfully employed for assessment of spatially and temporally distributed waterlogged areas in order to evaluate the impact of canal irrigation. Hyperspectral data from the Earth Observation System (EOS) in the optical region of the spectrum and microwave data may further improve assessment of the hydrological condition of irrigated lands. The results demonstrate utility of integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques for assessment of waterlogged areas particularly in regions where waterlogging conditions occur both due to excessive irrigation and accumulation of rain and floodwaters.},

abstract = {Assessing available water resources and their potential for irrigation water use is vital for sustainable agricultural development and planning. This is particularly of interest in developing countries like Ethiopia, where a small portion of largely accessible land for surface irrigation applications has been utilized, despite the majority of the population relying on agricultural productivity. This study utilized the Dhidhessa River Basin (Ethiopia) as a case study and analyzed the main challenges to balance the sustainable water resources utilization and enhance agricultural productivity of the basin. The study mainly focused on estimating the available water resources and their potential for surface irrigation water use in the basin. This was achieved by utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tools, a hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and a Crop Water and Irrigation Requirements Program of FAO (CROPWAT) model. While the SWAT estimated the water availability in the basin, GIS-tools such as Model Builder were used to map the irrigation potential of the basin. For irrigation water potential assessment, we selected six crops (cabbage, maize, tomato, pepper, groundnut and sugarcane) and estimated their irrigation water requirements using the CROPWAT model. We developed the SWAT model for the period from 1986 to 2012 using the available hydro-meteorological and geo-spatial data. Due to many parameters used in the model, we first performed a parameter sensitivity analysis and identified the most essential/sensitivity parameters via Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-II (SUFI-2). The identified sensitive parameters were subsequently used for model calibration (1989–2000) and validation (2001–2012) procedures achieved via SUFI-2. SWAT was able to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow values with a coefficient of determination (R²) and Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSE) of 0.85 and 0.87 for the calibration period and 0.91 and 0.89 for the validation period, respectively. The findings generally indicated a “good” performance of the model in simulating the hydrology. The annual available water of the basin is 9.26 billion cubic meters (BCM) whereas the 70{\%} and 80{\%} dependable flow is 7.56 and 6.97 BCM, respectively. Based on the Model Builder of ArcGIS, the SWAT estimated available water can potentially irrigate an area of 259,028 ha for slope less than 8{\%}, 643,162 ha for slopes less than 15{\%} and 1,023,581 ha for slopes less than 30{\%}. Moreover, the irrigation water requirements were calculated by the CROPWAT model for the six selected crops indicated that although the need for irrigation water varies depending on the season, the potential irrigation area of the Dhidhessa River Basin is greater than its irrigated land. Therefore, it is concluded that the basin's surface irrigation systems need to be expanded to enhance the agricultural productivity and improve the livelihood of the basin's communities and similar basins elsewhere.},

With the current crisis in the lake, an assessment of the existing networkchr('39')s performance is essential in the Urmia Lake Rescue Program. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the transmission, distribution, and utilization efficiency and irrigation efficiency at the surface of the network. Three products were selected from the cultivar with the highest crop area (10{\%} beet, 22{\%} and 22{\%}, and 38{\%} wheat). The dominant method of irrigation was surface irrigation. At the network level, soil moisture in the field before and after irrigation, soil physical and hydraulic properties and water use volume for irrigation were measured. The results showed that the average transmission efficiency in canals with the concrete coating of the network was about 79{\%}, which was in the range of 33{\%} (in the smaller channels) to 100{\%} (in the larger channels). The water distribution efficiency in the network was, on average, 76{\%}, varying from 50{\%} to 100{\%}. Water use efficiency in the fields based on soil moisture balance analysis varied from 41{\%} in the sandy loam soils to 66{\%} for the clay texture. Based on the analysis of the data on the amount of harvest, production costs and product sales price, the water use efficiency (in kilograms of product per cubic meter of water used) varied from 0.4 for the elderly hay to 5.1 for the sugar beet. The amount of water used in this network (in Rials per cubic meter of water consumption) was between 2740 for alfalfa aged over 10 years and 6900 for wheat. It can be concluded that in the case of water constraints, wheat, sugar beet and alfalfa could be the most economic cultivar, respectively.},

abstract = {Data on medium- to large-scale canal irrigation systems in the Philippines suggest that rehabilitation projects were not sufficient to close the gap between actual area irrigated and irrigation service area. This study analysed the underlying details of various rehabilitation and improvement works in three canal irrigation systems to identify an effective approach to close this gap. The findings show that the rehabilitation works generally focused on maintaining the original canals. Canal lining was the most common improvement work. The planning and design process adopted lacked revalidation of design criteria and assumptions used in the original system design. It did not have the benefit of diagnostic assessment studies. No technical assessments of water supply adequacy for proposed projects were carried out. The findings also indicate that the potential for increasing the actual area irrigated lay in augmentation of water supply, reuse of drainage water, use of adjustable gates at major water distribution points and strategic timing of irrigation schedules between tertiary areas to adapt to prevailing hydrological regimes. Consideration of these findings and an increased attention to consistency among available water supply, irrigation demand, physical design of structures and a realistic operational plan can greatly enhance the impacts of the irrigation modernisation plan in the Philippines.Original Abstract: Resume Les donnees sur les systemes de canaux d'irrigation a moyenne et grande echelle aux Philippines indiquent que les projets de rehabilitation n'ont pas suffi a combler l'ecart entre la superficie reelle irriguee et l'aire de service de l'irrigation. Pour aider a identifier une approche efficace a combler cet ecart, cette etude a analyse la rehabilitation et differents travaux d'amelioration de trois systemes d'irrigation par canaux. Les resultats montrent qu'en general, les travaux visent a maintenir les canaux dans leur configuration d'origine. La pose d'une doublure etait la methode de rehabilitation des canaux la plus courante. Le processus de planification et de conception n'a fait attention ni a la revalidation des criteres de conception, ni aux hypotheses utilisees dans la conception du systeme d'origine. Aucune evaluation de l'adequation de l'approvisionnement en eau pour les projets proposes n'a ete realisee. La prioritisation des projets de rehabilitation au niveau regional est basee sur l'urgence de l'intervention et sur la repartition equitable des fonds entre les systemes et des temps d'irrigation. Les resultats de l'etude de cas indiquent que le potentiel d'accroissement de la superficie reelle irriguee est l'augmentation de l'approvisionnement en eau, la reutilisation des eaux de drainage, l'utilisation de vannes ajustables aux points cruciaux, et un reglage judicieux du calendrier d'irrigation parmi les tertiaires pour s'adapter aux regimes hydrologiques preexistants. Le plan futur de modernisation de l'irrigation doit s'appuyer sur une strategie de modernisation qui repose sur la coherence entre l'approvisionnement et la disponibilite en eau, la demande d'irrigation, la conception physique des ouvrages et un plan operationnel realiste.},

abstract = {The study assessed the training needs of women in irrigation schemes in the North West Province. Primarily data were collected from 83 women selected using simple random sampling. A list of 23 competencies categorised into Pre and Post Planting, Irrigation management and Marketing was prepared. Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, percentages, the mean and standard deviation was employed. Training on appropriate application of herbicides and fungicides along with selecting appropriate planting methods for various crops (81{\%}) were the most prominent and important needs under pre- and post-planting. The results revealed that 74{\%} of the respondents suggest training on recommendation suitable profile and water conservation measures for specific farmland as the most important need under irrigation management. With regard to marketing, it was revealed that training needs on knowledge of marketing contracts emerged the most important with 81{\%}. The linear multiple regression results showed that the independent variables were significantly related to the F value of 39.802, P ≤ 0.05. The study concludes that extension agencies and agents should design regular training programmes for women farmers in the area of deficiencies identified and strengthen water user associations such that their problems could be addressed.},

abstract = {Background Rectal washout can prevent local recurrence after anterior resection of rectal cancer. Few studies have focused particularly on the association between irrigation fluids volume or agents and the risk of local recurrence after anterior resection of rectal cancer. Objective To estimate the association between irrigation fluids types, volumes of rectal washout and risk of local recurrence after anterior resection for cancer. Data Sources Relevant studies were identified by a search of Medline, Embase, Wiley Online Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register, Wanfang databases and Google Website from their inception until October 18,2013. Study Selection Studies reporting the association between rectal washout types and volumes and risk of local recurrence after anterior resection for cancer were included. Interventions Eligible studies used rectal washout. Control groups were defined as no washout. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Random-effects model were used to obtain summary estimates of RR and 95{\%} CI, with Stata version 11 and RevMan 5.2.5 softwares used. The quality of report was appraised in reference to the MINORS item. Results Of the 919 rectal cancer patients in 8 included studies, a total of 61(6.64{\%}) cases of local recurrence were reported, with a pooled RR 0.51 (95{\%}CI = 0.28-0.92, P = 0.03). The RRs 0.37 and 0.39 in normal saline and washout volume ( greater than or equal to 1500 ml normal saline) subgroup, respectively, indicated that rectal washout with normal saline, or greater than or equal to 1500 ml in volume could significantly reduce local recurrence (LR) rate (95{\%} CI = 0.17-0.79, P = 0.01; 95{\%} CI = 0.18-0.87, P = 0.02) after anterior resection for cancer. Limitation The included studies were non-randomized observational studies, with diversity of study designs. Conclusion Rectal washout with normal saline alone can reduce the risk of local recurrence in patients with resectable rectal cancer, and 1.5 liters rectal washout in volume is recommended.},

Comparing households across an enforcement algorithm's cutoff using a regression discontinuity design, we find that automated irrigation violation warnings cause substantial water conservation but also shift some consumption from regulated to unregulated hours within the week. In contrast, we show using data from a randomized experiment with the same customers that normative home water reports reduce water use by a much smaller amount, but that this social pressure is effective during all hours both before and after automating irrigation policy enforcement.

abstract = {Effective agricultural water management requires accurate, continuous, and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems, especially in water-limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed. Advances in sensor technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting, analyzing and reporting real-time data to infer irrigators' practices and behaviors, crop water requirements, water applications and use. In this research, an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive years. Production scale fields (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center pivot (P), gravity (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields. On average, irrigation was initiated 40–70 days after planting (DAP) and terminated by 120–140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest (70–90 {\%}) during July and August. Mean depth of water applied across all fields was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture, and evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, for soybean. Despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40–50 {\%}, actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 {\%} of the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non-scientific and/or technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics. New advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things (IoTs) can be leveraged to effectively create databases, track and compare water usage to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions in the United States and globally.},

abstract = {This study assessed whether availability of water for domestic use had any impact on nutritional status of children in an area where people depend on irrigation water for all their domestic water needs. During May 1998-April 1999, data on the occurrence of diarrhoea among 167 children aged less than five years were collected from 10 villages in the command area of the Hakra 6R canal in southern Punjab, Pakistan. Anthropometric measurements were taken at the end of the study period. Additional surveys were conducted to collect information on the availability of water, sanitary facilities, hygiene, and socioeconomic status. Height-for-age and longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea were used as outcome measures. Quantity of water available in households was a strong predictor of height-for-age and prevalence of diarrhoea. Children from households with a large storage capacity for water in the house had a much lower prevalence of diarrhoea and stunting than children from families without this facility. Having a toilet was protective for diarrhoea and stunting. Increased quantity of water for domestic use and provision of toilet facilities were the most important interventions to reduce burden of diarrhoea and malnutrition in this area. An integrated approach to water management is needed in irrigation schemes, so that supply of domestic water is given priority when allocating water in time and space within the systems.

abstract = {Water management in delta floodplains worldwide faces many challenges due to the changing climate and increasing human intervention in the hydrological regimes of rivers. Irrigation and drainage systems are necessary components of a water management strategy that aims to support human habitation and agricultural production, but which need effective coordination in order to adapt to exogenous impacts. However, management of such systems often fails for a variety of reasons. In the floodplain of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, irrigation and drainage systems under dike protection confront ineffective implementation of water management policy, posing a challenge for adaptation to exogenous impacts on the hydrological regime. Over the past two decades, farmers have increasingly cultivated annual triple‐rice crops in high‐dike compartments, ignoring government regulations that call for flood retention. This study analyses interviews with farmers to identify their motivation for not implementing the triennial cropping off‐season advised by the local government (3–3–2 cycle). Our findings show that farmers have avoided implementing the 3–3–2 cycle because of various disadvantages that the system presents for them. Local officials, in turn, have accepted farmers' disregard of the rule. Lessons learnt from this study are considered to explore measures to effectively adapt to future hydrological changes. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The sustainability of the Hetao Irrigation System, located in the water scarce upper Yellow River basin, is a priority considering the need for water saving, increased water productivity, and higher farmers' incomes. The upgrading of basin irrigation, the main irrigation method, is essential and includes the adoption of precise land levelling, cut-off management, improved water distribution uniformity, and adequate irrigation scheduling. With this objective, the current study focuses on upgrading wheat basin irrigation through improved design using a decision support system (DSS) model, which considers land parcels characteristics, crop irrigation scheduling, soil infiltration, hydraulic simulation, and environmental and economic impacts. Its use includes outlining water saving scenarios and ranking alternative designs through multi-criteria analysis considering the priorities of stakeholders. The best alternatives concern flat level basins with a 100 and 200 m length and inflow rates between 2 and 4 L s−1 m−1. The total irrigation cost of designed projects, including the cost of the autumn irrigation, varies between 2400 and 3300 Yuan ha−1; the major cost component is land levelling, corresponding to 33-46{\%} of total irrigation costs. The economic land productivity is about 18,000 Yuan ha−1. The DSS modelling defined guidelines to be applied by an extension service aimed at implementing better performing irrigation practices, and encouraged a good interaction between farmers and the Water Users Association, thus making easier the implementation of appropriate irrigation management programs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a basin-scale approach to irrigation planning for use in areas with scarce hydrological and meteorological data. We review the past development of cascade irrigation facilities in Cambodia's Kep Province and present the results of applying a distributed water circulation model that incorporates agricultural water use in Cambodia's Pursat River Basin. Basic hydrological and meteorological data are scarce for these areas, partly as a result of the Cambodian civil war. Although 70{\%} of overall water use is for agriculture, irrigation rates in many areas of monsoonal Asia are low and farming depends mainly on rainwater, even in basins where paddy fields are dominant and water resources are abundant. Moreover, basic hydrological and meteorological data are scarce in these areas. Past irrigation planning proposals in these areas have not specified the required volumes of water or the necessary capacities of irrigation facilities. Our consideration of irrigation projects in the Pursat River Basin, based on meteorological data inputs estimated by using a general circulation and/or climate change model, showed that basin-scale irrigation planning can be applied despite the scarcity of data. Application of the results of long-term climate change modelling by Japan's Meteorological Research Institute and a distributed water circulation model developed by Institute for Rural Engineering, NARO (NIRE), show that it is possible to model and use basic data when observational data are inadequate. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Increasing productivity and resource efficiency through sustainable intensification of grazing systems impose new challenges on crops and livestock. The sustainability of world agriculture is threatened by the degradation of ecosystem services anthropogenic interventions such as reduced biological diversity, water and air pollution, and loss of soil quality. The search for technologies that increase animal productivity with economic and environmental sustainability is necessary. The aim was to determine whether productive systems based on African Bermuda grass, overseeded in rows with annual ryegrass and black oat, would present better beef cattle performance by irrigation and/or inclusion of forage legumes in the grazing systems. We used 72 steers, 24 in each of the 3 years of evaluation, distributed in 12 paddocks under rotational stocking. Each paddock had four sub-paddocks. The experiment was completely randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, using irrigation and legumes as factors. Production and chemical composition of pastures and animal performance were evaluated for 3 years in winter, spring, and summer. The irrigation provided promising results in spring, with a higher stocking rate (2194 vs 1254 kg/ha) and live weight gain per area (5.24 vs 2.81 kg/ha/day) in the second year due to water restriction. The forage legumes with irrigation provided a higher average daily gain in the summer than the non-irrigated pasture with legumes. Here we show for the first time that in long-term results (3 years), the pastures with legumes showed a high live weight gain per area (1556 vs 1452 kg/ha/year), and in the third year, the highest difference for the stocking rate in the summer (4134 vs 3311 kg/ha). Legumes or irrigation do not change the pasture's nutritional compounds. The use of forage legumes benefits the grazing system with long-term results. Irrigation, conversely, allows for positive responses during periods of water deficit.},

abstract = {A critical objective for any wastewater reuse programme is to minimise health and environmental hazard. When applying wastewater to soil-plant systems, it is to be noted that the passage of water through the soil considerably reduces the number of microorganisms carried by the reclaimed wastewater. Factors that affect survival include number and type of microorganisms, soil organic matter content, temperature, moisture, pH, rainfall, sunlight, protection provided by foliage and antagonism by soil microflora. The purpose of this work was to examine the behaviour of fecal pollution indicators in a soil irrigated with treated wastewater under onsurface and subsurface drip irrigation. The experiment was conducted in a vineyard located at a commercial farm near the City of Arad (Israel). Wastewater and soil samples were monitored during the irrigation period and examined for fecal coliforms, somatic and F+ coliphages and helminth eggs. Physico-chemical parameters were controlled in order to determine their relationship with removal of microorganisms. The results showed high reduction of the concentration of microorganisms when wastewater moves through the soil; and a good correlation between the reduction of fecal pollution indicators and moisture content, organic matter concentration and pH. The application of secondary treated domestic wastewater in this specific soil and under these irrigation systems affect the survival of microorganisms, thus reducing the health and environmental risk.},

abstract = {Drinking water monitoring data have indicated anincrease in nitrate-nitrogen (NO sub(3)-N) concentration ingroundwater in some parts of the citrus production region ofFlorida. A proactive, incentive-based program of developingcrop-specific best management practices (BMP) began with theFlorida N-BMP legislation passed in 1994. A combination ofcareful irrigation and nitrogen (N) management is needed toimprove N uptake efficiency and to minimize potential leaching ofnitrate (NO sub(3)-N) to the groundwater. An improved Nmanagement practice is considered as a BMP, only if that practiceis proved to decrease NO sub(3)-N leaching into groundwater incommercial groves without adversely impacting the economics ofproduction. Therefore, long-term evaluation of horticulturalresponses as well as monitoring of groundwater NO sub(3)-N wereconducted in five commercial groves representing different soiltypes, citrus variety and rootstock, tree age, and culturalpractices to determine the impact of changes in N managementand/or irrigation scheduling. Groundwater NO sub(3)-N, leafnutrient concentrations, fruit yield and fruit quality weremonitored for 15 months under the growers' routine managementand, subsequently for 48 months, with improved N and irrigationmanagement practices. The N management practices evaluated inthis study included broadcast application of a combination ofwater soluble and slow release granular products, fertigation,and a combination of foliar application and fertigation. Irrigation management was improved by using tensiometer set pointof 10 and 15 cbar. This article presents the fruit yield, andconcentrations of N, P, K in six-month spring flush during thestudy period. The study showed that 5 to 8 yr old Valenciatrees on Volkamar lemon rootstock produced high quality fruit inthe range of 59 to 81 Mg ha super(-1) with 168 kg N ha super(-1) asfertigation combined with improved irrigation scheduling. Fruityield of 36 yr old Valencia orange trees on Rough lemonrootstock was greater with application of 180 kg N ha super(-1) yr super(-1) as fertigation compared to that of the trees whichreceived a similar rate of N as three broadcast applications ofgranular product. Fertilizer program comprising three foliarapplications of N using low biuret urea to deliver 66 kg N ha super(-1) yr super(-1) and an additional 76 kg N ha super(-1)yr super(-1)as fertigation was the most effective for decreasing the surficialgroundwater NO sub(3)-N while maintaining optimal fruit productionand nutritional status of the leaves.

abstract = {Purpose: This study evaluated bimanual intracapsular irrigation-aspiration for ectopia lentis with use of a small incision for 4-point scleral fixation of a foldable posterior-chamber intraocular lens (IOL) and anterior vitrectomy in patients with Marfan syndrome. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 18 eyes from 10 patients with Marfan syndrome who underwent surgical intervention for ectopia lentis at our clinic between July 2012 and September 2018. In this study, intraoperative and postoperative complications, uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure, and endothelial cell density were evaluated. Results: No intraoperative complications were reported. In all cases, early postoperative evaluation revealed a clear cornea, round pupil, and well-centered IOL. Mean logMAR uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.09 preoperatively to 0.56 postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.05). Mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.45 preoperatively to 0.17 postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.05). Aside from transient ocular hypertension, no postoperative complications were reported. Conclusion: The combined surgical technique presented above yields excellent visual outcomes with an extremely low incidence of complications. This approach is simple, safe, and effective in the treatment of ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan syndrome.},

abstract = {Background  Long-term use of urethral catheters is associated with high risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and blockage. Microbial biofilms are a common cause of catheter blockage, reducing their lifetime and significantly increasing morbidity of UTIs. A 0.02{\%} polyhexanide irrigation solution developed for routine mechanical rinsing shows potential for bacterial decolonization of urethral catheters and has the potential to reduce or prevent biofilm formation. Methods Using an in vitro assay with standard market-leading types of catheters artificially contaminated with clinically relevant bacteria, assays were carried out to evaluate the biofilm reduction and prevention potential of a 0.02{\%} polyhexanide solution versus no intervention (standard approach) and irrigation with saline solution (NaCl 0.9{\%}). The efficiency of decolonization was measured through microbial plate count and membrane filtration. Results Irrigation using a 0.02{\%} polyhexanide solution is suitable for the decolonization of a variety of transurethral catheters. The effect observed is significant compared to irrigation with 0.9{\%} saline solution (p = 0.002) or no treatment (p = 0.011). No significant difference was found between irrigation with 0.9{\%} saline solution and no treatment (p = 0.74). Conclusions A 0.02{\%} polyhexanide solution is able to reduce bacterial biofilm from catheters artificially contaminated with clinically relevant bacteria in vitro. The data shows a reduction of the viability of thick bacterial biofilms in a variety of commercially available urinary catheters made from silicone, latex-free silicone, hydrogel-coated silicone and PVC. Further research is required to evaluate the long-term tolerability and efficacy of polyhexanide in clinical practice.},

farmers practice in three plots with different level. This research
observes the farmer practice of SRI and Non-SRI during the uncertainty
of irrigation water supply and its effects on paddy biomass development
during growth stages and final stage of crop. A farmer group that
already understand the principle of SRI, applied this method into
several plots of their rented paddy field. Researcher interventions were
eliminated from their action, so it is purely on farmers decision on
managing their SRI plots. Three plots from both SRI and Non-SRI were
chosen based on the position of the plot related their access to water.
First plots had direct access to water from tertiary irrigation channel
(on farm). Second plots were received water from previous upper plots
and drainage water into other plots. Third plots were in the bottom
position, where they received water from upper plot, and drainage water
into farm drainage channel Result shows there are similar patterns of
root, straw, and leaves of biomass during crop growth. On the other
hand, during generative phase, grain development shows different pattern
and resulting different biomass in harvest time. Second plot, (of SRI)
that has water from first plot has the average of biomass grain per
plant of 54.4, higher than first plot and third plot, which are 33.8 g
and 38.4. Average biomass in second plot is 74.6 g, higher than first
and third plot, which are 49.9 g and 52.3 g.},

abstract = {In this study, the effectiveness of a bivariate analysis of agricultural drought characteristics for irrigation planning was evaluated. The case study was conducted in locations in central Italy and was based on olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes. For each locality, the available time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were used to simulate the daily soil water dynamics (SWt) for olive crops. The simulation was performed assuming 10 irrigation strategies, different for both the volume and date of the interventions. By applying the Theory of Runs to SWt, with a threshold corresponding to the readily available water, the agricultural drought events in the time series were identified and characterised by their duration D (days) and severity S (i.e. the cumulative evapotranspiration deficit in mm) for each locality and strategy. A 2-parameter Gamma distribution was fitted to both D and S, whilst their dependence structure was modelled by a Gumbel copula. The evaluation of the best irrigation strategy in each locality was obtained by comparing the contour lines of the pairs (d,s) having a 10-year return period for the condition D ≥ d AND S ≥ s. Results showed a great influence of both climate and irrigation strategy on the joint distribution of D and S. Some strategies, despite a very similar behaviour in the severity, differed a lot in terms of the associated values of duration, thus denoting different dynamics of water stress (more or less intense). Among the single-irrigation strategies, the optimal one was usually represented by an application at the end of June. Among the double-irrigation strategies, the optimal one involved two interventions, one at the end of June and one at the end of July. These results were also discussed taking into account the corresponding probability of consecutive severe drought events.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of social capital with bonding and bridging distinction in promoting higher participation in collective action in participatory irrigation management. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 304 farmers was surveyed using a structured questionnaire. A focus group discussion was also carried out with randomly selected water users, leaders and irrigation officers. A confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the hypothesised relationship of bonding and bridging social capital towards collective action. Findings: The findings show that social capital has a significant direct effect on collective action and an indirect effect on joint irrigation management's perceived performance through collective action (mediator). It implies the need to complement the participatory irrigation management programme with an understanding of the social aspects for a higher farmer's participation over the shared resource. Originality/value: The paper emphasises social capital's role in facilitating a real participatory engagement in shared resource management. Also, it is the first scholarly work linking social capital with bonding and bridging distinction towards collective action in a joint resource management context. {\textcopyright} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Jordan has scarce and declining forest resources. Its low and variable rainfall has dictated the use of drought-tolerant species such as Pinus halepensis Mill. (Pinaceae) in rainfed forestation programs. We hypothesized that treated wastewater can be used to improve survival and growth of forest seedlings, and to diversify forestations. A split-plot experimental design was utilized to examine the effect of water regime (rainfed, municipal-treated wastewater, and freshwater) on seedlings' survival and growth of eight forest species for 2 years. Irrigation improved survival rate of all evaluated species compared to rainfed conditions. Although irrigation was stopped during the second year, a lingering effect of irrigation treatment was observed. Moreover, wastewater irrigation resulted in comparable survival rates to those of freshwater, suggesting that wastewater can be used to improve forestation success. Survival rates under wastewater irrigation were noticed to vary by species. Seedlings growth and leaf N content were significantly greater under wastewater as compared to freshwater treatment, indicating that wastewater provided water as well as nutrients. Under rainfed condition, Juniperus phoenicea had the highest survival rate as compared to all other species, which suggests that forestation projects species diversity could be improved even under rainfed conditions.},

abstract = {Irrigated agriculture enables production intensification and crop diversification to improve food security. However, increasing irrigation water stress and inadequate competence of smallholder farmers in irrigation water management have the potential to exacerbate food insecurity. Therefore, this study seeks to determine smallholder farmers' competency needs in irrigation water management practices (IWMP). A convenience sampling method was employed to obtain a sample population of n= 250. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe smallholder farmers' demographic characteristics. Borich's Needs Assessment Model (BNAM) was utilised to analyse smallholder farmers' competency needs. Results revealed that smallholder farmers perceived weed control (M = 4.90) and understanding the consequences of over- and under-irrigation (M = 4.48) as highly important practices. Results also revealed that smallholder farmers were only highly competent in weed control (M = 4.59). Moreover, results revealed that the top two most important competency needs for smallholder farmers are knowledge of drought-tolerant cultivars (MWDS = 6.83) and irrigation scheduling (MWDS = 5.05). From the survey findings, smallholder farmers' competency in IWMP is insufficient. It is recommended that the government, policymakers, and agricultural support services embark on sustainable agricultural development planning issues and develop a relevant training programme that is informed by smallholder farmers' competency needs.},

The consequences could be useful for controlling the insect herbivores. The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a devastating invasive leaf-mining pest on tomato and other solanaceous plants, is currently threatening the tomato production worldwide. Recent knowledge of bottom-up effects on this pest has been gained, with fertilization, irrigation, plant resistance traits, as well as their interactions, being the major sources of these effects. Evidence is now emerging on how they impact on the performance of the moth from the perspective of tri-trophic interactions.

abstract = {The State government has a vital role to play in developing groundwater resources to help improve the lot of the poorest people in eastern India's rural communities. Many States have tried to achieve this over the past 50 years through centrally planned public tube-well programs. Recently published research says that most of these efforts have failed to bring irrigation or improved livelihoods to the poor.
This research shows how policy makers can have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction by removing pump subsidies and opening pump markets to international competition. Subsidies and import restrictions have kept pump prices in India artificially inflated, by more than 35-45{\%}, over those of neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh.
If a 'shock therapy' approach of removing restrictions is too drastic or politically difficult, the next best option is to use market mechanisms to manage pump subsidy and loan programs for the poor. A good example of this approach is the jointly managed subsidy programs that have helped usher in eastern India's belated Green Revolution. Here local pump dealers are active participants in the management of pump subsidy programs, alongside government and nationalized banks. The examples of eastern Uttar Pradesh and north Bihar provide working models of such approaches.},

abstract = {Background  Land use change has increasingly been expanding throughout the world in the past decades. It can have profound effects on the spatial and temporal distribution of vector borne diseases like malaria through ecological and habitat change. Understanding malaria disease occurrence and the impact of prevention interventions under this intense environmental modification is important for effective and efficient malaria control strategy. Methods A descriptive ecological study was conducted by reviewing health service records at Abobo district health office. The records were reviewed to extract data on malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevention and control methods. Moreover, Meteorological data were obtained from Gambella region Meteorology Service Center and National Meteorology Authority head office. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques were used to analyze the data. Results For the twelve-year time period, the mean annual total malaria case count in the district was 7369.58. The peak monthly malaria incidence was about 57 cases per 1000 people. Only in 2009 and 2015 that zero death due to malaria was recorded over the past 12 years. Fluctuating pattern of impatient malaria cases occurrence was seen over the past twelve years with an average number of 225.5 inpatient cases. The data showed that there is a high burden of malaria in the district. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) was a predominant parasite species in the district with the maximum percentage of about 90. There was no statistically significant association between season and total malaria case number (F3,8: 1.982, P:0.195). However, the inter-annual total case count difference was statistically significant (F11,132: 36.305, p {\textless} 0001). Total malaria case count had shown two months lagged carry on effect. Moreover, 3 months lagged humidity had significant positive effect on total malaria cases. Malaria prevention interventions and meteorological factors showed statistically significant association with total malaria cases. Conclusion Malaria was and will remain to be a major public health problem in the area. The social and economic impact of the disease on the local community is clearly pronounced as it is the leading cause of health facility visit and admission including the mortality associated with it. Scale up of effective interventions is quite important. Continuous monitoring of the performance of the vector control tools needs to be done.},

Research and Extension Center in 1994, an extensive population of this
rare, secretive marsh bird was found inhabiting palustrine emergent
persistent (PEM1) wetlands throughout the northern Sierra Nevada
foothills. We inventoried a variety of PEM1 wetlands to determine which
habitats would likely support black rails. Black rails were positively
associated with larger PEM1 wetlands that had flowing water, dense
vegetation and irrigation water as a primary source; they were
negatively associated with fringe wetlands and seasonal water regimes.
Recommendations for managing black rail habitat in the northern Sierra
foothills include prioritizing the conservation of PEM1 wetlands with
permanently or semipermanently flooded water regimes and shallow water
zones (less than 1.2 inches), especially those that are greater than
0.25 acres in size; avoiding wetland vegetation removal or overgrazing,
especially during the black rail breeding season (approximately March
through July); maintaining and improving wetland connectivity; ensuring
that impacts to black rails are considered in the environmental review
process for development projects; and integrating management guidelines
for black rails into existing wetland conservation programs.},

abstract = {Tanks are one of the main sources for the irrigation in the country. Out of average net irrigated area of 62 Mha in India during 2001–2015, 3{\%} of area is irrigated through tanks, as against 15{\%} in the 1950s. The deterioration of tanks was a matter of concern for most of the states in South India. Government of Telangana launched five-year long programme called 'Mission Kakatiya' in 2014 to harness the benefits of tank irrigation by increasing command area and water supply available for irrigation. In order to assess volume of water stored in a tank, the information on water level and corresponding water spread area is essential through elevation-area-capacity (EAC) curve. However, such information is not available for most of the irrigation tanks in the country. Generation of terrain information of tank storage area using remote sensing technology is one of the options available today. Stereo images from space borne and aerial platforms are not sufficient enough for generating terrain information for very shallow water bodies like irrigation tanks. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to use images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle platform instead of stereo images from other sources/platforms for generating EAC curve. UAV is flown when the tanks are almost dry, for generation of very high resolution digital terrain model. This can be used to establish EAC curve. This EAC curve in combination with the near real-time water spread area obtained from satellite remote sensing can be used to estimate the volume of water available in a tank. In order to assess the feasibility, a drone survey was carried out over Teegalanarayana Cheruvu, a small tank near Godumakunta village of Keesara Mandal in the outskirts of Hyderabad city, Telangana. Images collected were processed to generate digital terrain model and this was used to derive the EAC curve for the tank. Using satellite-based water spread area from LISS-IV sensor along with EAC curve, the volume of water stored was estimated as 60,812 m³, 88,830 m³ and 22,160 m³ as on November 30, 2016, November 1, 2017, and March 25, 2018, respectively. The study proves that this approach is cost-effective, feasible and less time-consuming.},

abstract = {As rainfall becomes scarcer or more erratic, we rely more on irrigation systems for agricultural and human water provision. Impacts of irrigation canals such as the barrier effect on wildlife movements are poorly documented. Although canal culverts and overpasses can be used by wildlife, little is known about their crossing behavior to guide barrier effect mitigation efforts. Over seven years, we recorded medium-sized carnivore crossings by video-surveillance through 30 culverts and 28 overpasses in a large irrigation project in south-central Portugal. We examined the influence of the structures' features and landscape context on the likelihood of canal crossing. Culvert crossings were positively influenced by the proportion of nearby montado, a high nature value farming system. Overpass crossings were more likely in areas away from paved roads and with more nearby wetlands. Overpasses increased the crossing rates by about 11{\%} relative to culverts and both were crossed more often in landscapes with evenly distributed land uses. In the project area, 20{\%} of the montado has recently transitioned to irrigated agriculture, and wetlands have increased by 43{\%}. It is therefore plausible that the increase in the crossing rate of overpasses relative to culverts will be accentuated. Our study produced the first evidence of a contrast in crossing rates among irrigation canal crossing structures. We have shown that the landscape can be a driver of animal crossings but irrigation projects can in turn be transformative of the landscape. Broadly, the fact that the deployment of irrigation canals may favor some land uses over others creates a conundrum that needs careful consideration when planning barrier effect mitigation interventions.},

abstract = {South Africa is classified as a water-scarce country, and depends on agriculture for food production. The irrigation sector is the largest consumer of water in the country, accounting for about 62{\%} of water utilisation, but also losing 30-40{\%}. Given the threat of drought and climate change, efficient irrigation systems have become a necessity, especially in the smallholder farming sector where most losses occur. Smallholder irrigation schemes (SIS) were developed to improve rural livelihoods through sustainable food production for food security and poverty alleviation, but these development objectives remain largely unfulfilled. The objectives of this review were to assess challenges facing SIS and explore opportunities for revitalising the schemes. The focus was on government policy and strategies to support smallholder farmers. A review of government policy showed that although the needs and interests of smallholder farmers are high on the national agenda, there is insufficient financial support to the sector, suggesting that smallholder agriculture is not really seen as a potential driver of the economy. The core focus of the government on repairing irrigation infrastructure while neglecting the soft components relating to capacity building has partly been blamed for the failure of SIS in South Africa. Capacity building is one of the missing links in smallholder irrigation development and many failures have been attributed to lack of adequately trained farmers and extension staff, particularly in irrigation water management. Land tenure insecurity has been singled out as a major institutional challenge leading to poor performance of irrigation schemes. The diversity of schemes means that different kinds of interventions are needed to respond to varying farmers' needs, resources and agricultural contexts. These findings point to the need to balance the soft and hard components of the irrigation schemes for sustainability. It is therefore evident that the government needs to review its priorities in revitalisation of SIS. Land tenure policies allowing increased access to arable land need to be developed urgently, together with the promotion of alternative cropping systems that are suitable for the smallholder farming sector.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the hydraulic performance of irrigation structures should be used in proper planning of water distribution and the removal of social tensions at water user level. There are several hydraulic indicators that could be interpreted based on social realities. In this study, besides determination of water distribution and conveyance indicators of the Behbahan irrigation scheme, social status was investigated in relation to them. Accordingly, adequacy, dependability and equity indicators in this scheme are poor. Meanwhile, 54{\%} of water users are not satisfied with the performance of water delivery. Based on the questionnaires, training about water distribution is the main request by water users. In this research with a different view about the evaluation of irrigation schemes, existing problems were described from the social perspective. The adequacy indicator is in good condition upstream of the network, while in downstream it is about 40{\%}. Although the knowledge and awareness of water users upstream and downstream are almost equal, only 50{\%} of downstream water users have a relative desire to participate in water services (68{\%} for upstream water users) and their satisfaction is within 20{\%} (62{\%} for upstream water users). Finally, evaluation of hydraulic indicators will be completed and will solve more problems, by considering the social roots of the results.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}L'{\'{e}}valuation des performances hydrauliques des ouvrages d'irrigation serait utilis{\'{e}}e pour planifier correctement la distribution de l'eau et {\'{e}}liminer les tensions sociales au niveau des utilisateurs de l'eau.

abstract = {The Chambal river plays an essential role in satisfying all water demands for the two million population of Kota and nearby districts of Rajasthan (India). This research aims to analyse the Chambal river water quality for irrigation in the upstream and downstream of Kota dam, Rajasthan (India), for five years, from 2017 to 2021. The irrigation water quality of the Chambal river at Kota is estimated with the help of five indices, namely, the permeability index (PI). Kelly ration (KR), magnesium hazard (MH), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), and sodium absorption ratio (SAR). Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate were analysed from 2017 to 2021 to complete irrigation water quality indices (IWQIs) for the Chambal river upstream and downstream of the Kota dam. Akalgarh is situated upstream of the Kota dam, while Rangpur, SRRT, and Keshoraipatan in the downstream. The irrigation water quality indices (IWQIs) are estimated to access river water quality for agricultural use. SAR, SAP, KR, MH, and PI had higher values in downstream sampling points than upstream during the observation period of five years. Hence, upstream river water is more suitable for use in agricultural activities. The evaluated IWQIs are the best rating tool for Chambal river water quality. Different characteristics of Chambal river water may be assessed through these IWQIs. The best management program and pollution control strategies can be determined, which ultimately helps stack holders for decision making.},

abstract = {The fiber from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) makes up approximately 90{\%} of the global cotton produced each year. Fiber quality is important to textile mills for processing and factors into bulk cotton sales. Fiber quality can be affected by many environmental factors, including water deficit, which makes identifying major fiber characteristics an important focus for breeding programs. Cotton fibers are specialized trichomes that are primarily composed of cellulose but have a cuticle composed of free waxes and cutin. Total cuticular wax of cotton fiber has been shown to act as a lubricant during textile processing, but has also been negatively correlated with important quality traits. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the cuticular wax compounds of cotton fiber under water-limited (WL) and well-watered (WW) irrigation treatments and assess their relationship with fiber quality from seven upland cotton lines. Through the most detailed characterization of cotton fiber cuticular wax to date, 41 quantifiable compounds were identified including free fatty acids, primary alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, and tentatively identified alkanediols. Of these 41 compounds and their sum (total waxes), the abundance for nine were significantly different ($\alpha$=0.05) between WL and WW conditions. Total wax and 36 compounds were highly repeatable (r≥0.60), indicating they will respond positively to selection in cotton breeding programs. Irrespective of irrigation regime, strong positive correlations (rp 0.64–0.80) were found for fiber length and uniformity with primary alcohols, fatty acids, and aldehydes. These findings suggest that the biosynthetic pathways associated with these compounds are contributing to the phenotypic variability of these two important fiber quality traits and thus the biochemical pathways associated with cuticular fiber wax are candidates for metabolic engineering via molecular breeding approaches.},

abstract = {Background  Stunting is a critical public health problem of developing countries like Ethiopia. Different interventions like irrigation activity have been carried out by the government of Ethiopia to improve the nutritional status of the community. However, there is scanty of data on childhood stunting and its associated factors between irrigation user and non-irrigation user. Objective To assess the magnitude of childhood stunting and its associated factors between irrigation and non-irrigation user in North Mecha District, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based comparative cross-sectional study design was employed from October to November 2019. A systematic sampling was used to draw mothers with children age 6–59 months (582 irrigated and 582 non- irrigated household users). Data were collected using questionnaire and anthropometric measurement tools. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of stunting. Adjusted odds ratios with 95{\%} CI were used to determine the degree of association between independent and outcome variable. A-p-value {\textless} 0.05 was used as cutoff point to declare statistically significant variables with the outcome variable. Results The prevalence of childhood stunting (6–59 months) among irrigation users [32.8{\%} at 95{\%}CI [29.1{\%}-36.7{\%}]] was slightly lower than non-users [40.2{\%} at 95{\%}CI [[36.3{\%}-44.2{\%}]]]. However, the difference did not show significant variation. The odds of childhood stunting were higher among a child from a mother had no antenatal visit, a child whose age was between 12 and 47 months, a child from a mother who did not use water and soap always for washing hands, and a child who had fever. Conclusion The prevalence of childhood stunting was high and did not show significant variation between irrigation and non-irrigation users. A child from mother had no antenatal visit, whose age was between 12 and 47 months, a mother who did not use water and soap always for washing hands, and who had fever were factors associated with higher child stunting. Thus, the identified modifiable factors should be strengthened to reduce stunting.},

Solution R (Uro-trainer), which contains 6{\%} citric acid, is a solution licensed for use in the management of struvite stone disease in the UK. We report our experience.METHODS23 kidneys in 22 patients (10 male and 12 female patients, mean age 45, range 15-60 years) underwent solution R irrigation following debulking of the stone with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (n = 20), ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy (n = 2) combined with open procedures (n = 4) between 1994 and 1998. The original stone configuration consisted of 14 staghorn, 4 partial staghorn and 5 large burden stones. Irrigation was performed through a nephrostomy tube (n = 20) or in a retrograde fashion (n = 3) using a closed infusion pump system (40 ml/h). The response to treatment was checked using a nephrostogram and/or plain X-ray.RESULTSIn 6 (26{\%}) kidneys, after an average duration of 2 (1-5) days, irrigation had to be abandoned due to loin pain, leak or sepsis. The average duration of irrigation was 6.4 (1-20) days. At the end of irrigation, a total of 4 (17.4{\%}) kidneys had complete radiographic clearance, while the stone was reduced to calyceal dust in 3 (13{\%}). Partial response was seen in 11 (47.8{\%}) and no response in 5 (21.8{\%}) kidneys. Following additional alternative intervention(s) in 6 (26{\%}) kidneys (4 with partial and 2 with no response) further clearance was achieved in 3 (13{\%}) and calyceal dust status in 3 (13{\%}). The response was better if the stone was reduced to less than 10mm prior to irrigation. At the mean follow-up of 2.44 (1-4) years, of 13 kidneys with stone clearance or calyceal dust, 9 suffered recurrence or re-growth, 5 of which required further interventions. Only 4 (17.4{\%}) of 23 kidneys remained stone free.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with complex stone disease, adjuvant solution R irrigation can reduce the stone burden. There is a considerable potential for side effects necessitating close monitoring for sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities. However, the overall success rate for solution R is limited.},

The spatial distribution of IWQI agrees with the spatial distribution of the most parameters. The results of our approach reveal that the majority of samples are suitable for irrigation uses for both aquifers except few wells in the confined aquifer.

Because of these indices like permeability index (PI), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), etc., depending on specific elements, entirely subjective, as well as the great variations in their results, particularly when classifying water quality. Thus, IWQI is created based on eight indices that are generally used to evaluate irrigation water quality, plus three physicochemical parameters have been proven an impact on water quality. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to minimize the subjectivity at assign parameter weights under multiple criteria decision analysis tools (MCDA). The spatial distribution of IWQI agrees with the spatial distribution of the most parameters. The results of our approach reveal that the majority of samples are suitable for irrigation uses for both aquifers except few wells in the confined aquifer. Also, noted that there are very variations in the irrigation indices results for classifying water quality. The comparison result showed that the new index robust, fair calculations and has best classifying of water quality.},

abstract = {Large amounts of water applied as urban irrigation can often be reduced substantially without compromising esthetics. Thus, encouraging the adoption of water-saving technologies and practices is critical to preserving water resources, yet difficult to achieve. The research problem addressed in this study is the lack of characterization of residents who use urban irrigation, which hinders the design of effective behavior change programs. This study examined audience segmentation as an approach to encouraging change using current residential landscape practices. K-means cluster analysis identified three meaningful subgroups among residential landscape irrigation users (N = 1,063): the water considerate majority (n = 479, 45 {\%}), water savvy conservationists (n = 378, 36 {\%}), and unconcerned water users (n = 201, 19 {\%}). An important finding was that normative beliefs, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control characteristics of the subgroups were significantly different with large and medium practical effect sizes. Future water conservation behaviors and perceived importance of water resources were also significantly different among subgroups. The water considerate majority demonstrated capacity to conserve, placed high value on water, and were likely to engage in behavior changes. This article contributes to the literature on individuals who use residential landscape irrigation, an important target audience with potential to conserve water through sustainable irrigation practices and technologies. Findings confirm applicability of the capacity to conserve water to audience segmentation and extend this concept by incorporating perceived value of water resources and likelihood of conservation. The results suggest practical application to promoting residential landscape water conservation behaviors based on important audience characteristics.},

abstract = {This paper utilizes a Ricardian model to test the relationship between annual net revenues and climate across Israeli farms. The study finds that it is important to include the amount of irrigation water available to each farm in order to measure the response of farms to climate. With irrigation water omitted, the model predicts climate change is strictly beneficial. However, with water included, the model predicts that only modest climate changes are beneficial while drastic climate change in the long run will be harmful. Using the AOGCM Scenarios we show that farm net revenue is expected to increase. Although Israel has a relatively warm climate a mild increase in temperature is beneficial due to the ability to supply international markets with farm product early in the season. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Two field studies were conducted to compare the effects of preplant nitrogen (N) rates and irrigation programs on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) growth and yields. Irrigation programs were seepage (subsurface) irrigation alone at a water volume of 28 acre-inches/acre per season and seepage plus drip irrigation at a volume of 28 and 14 acre-inches/acre per season, respectively. Preplant N fertilization rates were 200, 250, and 300 lb/acre, using ammonium nitrate as the N source. There were significant irrigation program by N rate interactions for nitrate (NO3-) petiole concentrations at 8 weeks after transplanting (WAT), and yield of extra-large fruit and total marketable fruit, but not for plant height at 5 and 7 WAT. The highest NO3-N petiole concentrations were found in plots treated with 200, 250, and 300 lb/acre for N and seepage plus drip irrigation, and with 300 lb/acre N under seepage irrigation alone. For the total marketable fruit weight, there were no differences among N rates in those plots irrigated with the seepage plus drip combination, ranging between 23.8 and 25.9 tons/acre. However, there was a significant N effect in plots receiving only seepage irrigation with marketable fruit weight almost doubling from 12.0 to 22.7 tons/acre when applying 200 and 300 lb/acre N, respectively. Both irrigation programs had equivalent performance when 300 lb/acre N were applied.},

abstract = {In Tunisia, the expansion of irrigated area and the semiarid climate make it compulsory to adopt strategies of water management to increase water use efficiency. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), providing the application of high frequency small irrigation volumes below the soil 1surface have been increasingly used to enhance irrigation efficiency. Deficit irrigation has shown successful results with a large number of crops in various countries. Objective of this paper was to assess the effects of deficit irrigation on gross margin and water use efficiency of potatoes crop, irrigated with subsurface drip irrigation, in a semiarid area of central Tunisia. After assessing the validity of FAO-56 spreadsheet program to well simulate soil water status in the root zone, water use efficiency (WUE) was evaluated based on crop yield and simulated actual evapotranspiration. At the same time, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was determined as the ration between crop yield and the amount of water supply to the crop (irrigation). Field experiments, were carried out in Central Tunisia (10 ? 33' 47.0" E, 35 ? 58' 8.1 ? N, 19 m a.s.l) on a potatoes crop planted in a sandy loam soil, during the growing season 2014, from 15 January to 6 May. Soil water status was monitored in two plots (T1 and T2) maintained under the same management, except for irrigation volumes, provided by a SDI system. More particular, irrigation was scheduled according to the average water content measured in the root zone, with a total of 8 watering, with timing ranging between one and three hours in T1, and between about half-anhour and one-hour and a-half, in T2. FAO-56 was validated according the average soil water content in all tubes and all observation depths with RMSE values, equal to 0.012 cm3cm-3 and 0.028 cm3cm-3, respectively for T1 and T2. Simulated actual evapotranspiration in T1 was equal to the potential evapotranspiration. However, it resulted lower than potential evapotranspiration. WUE resulted equal to 32 Kg/m3 and 16 Kg/m3, whereas IWUE was equal to 31.7 Kg/m3 and 45.70 Kg/m3 for treatments T1 and T2. In terms of gross margin, T1 were more efficient than T2. This finding is directly related to sheep price of water, although its scarcity. The experimental results and model simulations provided useful guidelines for a more sustainable use of irrigation water.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this study was to assess ex vivo the erosive effects of passive ultrasonic irrigation versus irrigation with reciprocating activation on the dentinal surface of the root canal at 3 predetermined levels using environmental scanning electron microscopy.METHODSTen roots of mandibular premolars were prepared using the ProTaper Universal system (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The specimens were embedded in flasks cleaved longitudinally, and indentations were made 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 mm from the apex. The specimens in the control group (n = 10) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing 2.5{\%} sodium hypochlorite and 17{\%} EDTA and then dried. Then, environmental scanning electron microscopic images were obtained at magnification × 800. The specimens were then reassembled in their flasks, and the NaOCl and EDTA solutions were activated according to the conditions established for the experimental groups (ie, the passive ultrasonic irrigation group [n = 5] and the EasyClean (Easy Equipamentos Odontol{\'{o}}gicos, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil) group, irrigation with reciprocating activation with the EasyClean instrument [n = 5]). The specimens of both experimental groups were analyzed in the same manner as in the control group. Analysis of the dentinal surface topography was conducted using the 3D Roughness Reconstruction program (Phenom-World BV, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) as a means for assessing erosion. The data were evaluated by means of the Kruskal-Wallis, Student-Newman-Keuls, and Mann-Whitney tests.RESULTSIn the EasyClean group, the degree of dentinal erosion at 3.0 mm was significantly higher than at 9.0 mm. In the other comparisons, there was no statistically significant difference (P {\textless} .05).CONCLUSIONSThe final irrigation techniques tested were equivalent in relation to the degree of erosion caused to the dentinal surface.},

abstract = {This paper argues about some performance criteria in irrigation schemes according to the situation of before and after irrigation management transfer in Turkey. Irrigation management transfer is defined as the transfer of authority and responsibility to manage irrigation systems from government agencies to water users organizations. Irrigation management transfer is a reform which has been strongly supported by Turkey's government as they realize greater participation of farmers in the management of irrigation systems. This is a monitoring and evaluation study which are the methods for assessing the performance of interventions, in this case the transfer of irrigation management from government to users. Many positive effects have been realized by the transfer process of irrigation management in Turkey. Initial results of the transfer included a doubling of irrigation fee collection rates and a shifting of operation and maintenance expenditures from the public to the users, an accumulation of reserves in some irrigation associations for future capital purchases, a reduced wage for operation and maintenance personnel, and indications of expansions of irrigated area in some transferred schemes.},

abstract = {Programs targeting conversion to irrigation techniques promoted as water-efficient, such as drip irrigation, are multiplying worldwide with the claimed objective to secure food production while alleviating the pressure on water resources. However, there is a persisting and widespread questioning about the actual impact when implementing the techniques in the real-world context, particularly in smallholder farms. We propose a framework to support an integrated assessment of the impact on farm holding performance resulting from the conversion towards a new irrigation technique. It is implemented for a 4030 ha agricultural district in the Triffa plain of NE Morocco where increasing number of farms are changing surface to drip irrigation. The indicators within the framework are calculated using survey data from a sample of 25 farm holdings collected in 2012 and 2013. The survey data are enriched with institutional data and data estimated from hydrologic modeling. The results indicate that, in the study area, farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors, while most environmental and economic indicators are signaling a neutral or undesirable effect resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation. These results question the relevance of the water use reduction objective underlying the ongoing national plan “Plan Maroc Vert” (PMV) that aims converting up to 50{\%} of irrigated agricultural land in drip irrigation, and call for a stronger appropriation of this water-saving objective by the farm holders. However, limited data availability and quality did not allow to firmly demonstrate the robustness of the findings. This severe data constraint revealed the difficulty to assess the socio-eco and environmental impact of such irrigation plan in the study area, and highlights the need for a data collection, centralization, and sharing effort. Conditioned to a strong reduction in data uncertainty, the framework methodology proposed in this study can serve as a practical reference for other studies seeking for an integrated assessment of irrigation management changes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDAdult malaria vector sampling is the most important parameter for setting up an intervention and understanding disease dynamics in malaria endemic areas. The intervention will ideally be species-specific according to sampling output. It was the objective of this study to evaluate four sampling techniques, namely human landing catch, pit shelter, indoor resting collection and odour-baited entry trap.METHODOLOGYThese four sampling methods were evaluated simultaneously for thirty days during October 2008, a season of low mosquitoes density and malaria transmission. These trapping methods were performed in one village for maximizing homogeneity in mosquito density. The cattle and man used in odour-baited entry trap were rotated between the chambers to avoid bias.RESULTSA total of 3,074 mosquitoes were collected. Among these 1,780 (57.9{\%}) were Anopheles arabiensis and 1,294 (42.1{\%}) were Culex quinquefasciatus. Each trap sampled different number of mosquitoes, Indoor resting collection collected 335 (10.9{\%}), Odour-baited entry trap-cow 1,404 (45.7{\%}), Odour-baited entry trap-human 378 (12.3{\%}), Pit shelter 562 (18.3{\%}) and HLC 395 (12.8{\%}). General linear model univariate analysis method was used, position of the trapping method had no effect on mosquito density catch (DF = 4, F = 35.596, P = 0.78). Days variation had no effect on the collected density too (DF = 29, F = 4.789, P = 0.09). The sampling techniques had significant impact on the caught mosquito densities (DF = 4, F = 34.636, P {\textless} 0.0001). The Wilcoxon pair-wise comparison between mosquitoes collected in human landing catch and pit shelter was significant (Z = -3.849, P {\textless} 0.0001), human landing catch versus Indoor resting collection was not significant (Z = -0.502, P = 0.615), human landing catch versus odour-baited entry trap-man was significant (Z = -2.687, P = 0.007), human landing catch versus odour-baited entry trap-cow was significant (Z = -3.127, P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONOdour-baited traps with different baits and pit shelter have shown high productivity in collecting higher densities of mosquitoes than human landing catch. These abilities are the possibilities of replacing the human landing catch practices for sampling malaria vectors in areas with An. arabiensis as malaria vectors. Further evaluations of these sampling methods need to be investigated is other areas with different species.},

abstract = {Participatory irrigation management is gradually being introduced in the canal irrigation system in Pakistan. In this study, performance of a participatory irrigation management system is compared with that of a conventional centrally controlled irrigation system. The study is carried out for canal irrigation systems of Lower Chenab and Jhelum, both located in Punjab, Pakistan. The performance indicators used included: establishment cost, operation and maintenance cost, water fees (abiana) collected and equity of water distribution. The data for performance assessment were collected from various sources, including field measurements, interviews with farmers, interviews with officers of the irrigation department, previous studies, and data from the Punjab Irrigation Department and the Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority. The analysis indicates that establishment costs of both public-private partnership management and a centrally controlled irrigation system are more than operational and maintenance costs. The water supply in the main canal is satisfactory in both systems. Water fees (abiana) collected are declining in the case of the participatory management system. Structural change in the participatory management system and extensive work on capacity building are required in order to obtain the benefits of transferring management to farmers' organizations in Pakistan.

abstract = {Drought stress reduces late-maturing soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields in the Mid-southern USA. Irrigated, early-maturing soybean cultivars have similar yields to late-maturing soybean cultivars, but they require less irrigation when grown in narrow rows and at high populations. However, there is little information on how early-maturing cultivars respond to drought compared with late-maturing cultivars. We hypothesized that yields of early-maturing soybean would be decreased more than late-maturing soybean when drought occurred. The objectives of this study were to (i) compare responses of early-maturing and late-maturing soybean to drought, and (ii) assess methods for scheduling irrigation of early-maturing and late-maturing soybean. Field studies were conducted in AR in 2007 (one location) and 2008 (two locations). Two cultivars from each of the maturity groups (MG) I, II, Ill, IV, and V were used. A line source sprinkler irrigation system was used to apply an irrigation gradient from full to no irrigation. At Fayetteville in 2007 and 2008, cultivars and MGs were used as covariates, and yield was regressed as a function of total seasonal water (TSW), which was defined as the amount of irrigation plus rainfall from emergence to R6 (full seed development). There was no difference between cultivars within each MG in yield response to TSW in both years. Yields of MG I, II, Ill, IV, and V all decreased linearly as TSW decreased from optimal to no irrigation. The slopes of the regression equations between yield and TSW became less steep as the MGs increased in 2007. In 2008, there was plentiful rainfall resulting in minimal drought stress, and early-maturing soybean and late-maturing soybean had similar yield responses to TSW. At Keiser in 2008, MG V cultivars produced higher yields than MG I and II in the suboptimal irrigation experiments. These results demonstrated that drought had a greater effect on early-maturing soybean than late-maturing soybean. Stomatal conductance and canopy temperature measurements indicated that crop transpiration began to decline at the beginning of R6, which would decrease irrigation requirement. The University of Arkansas' irrigation scheduling program and the Excel spreadsheet program proposed by Purcell et al. (2007) agreed well during August and September after the soybean canopy was completely closed. The Excel spreadsheet program provides an effective, alternative method for scheduling irrigation for soybean associated with narrow rows and high populations.},

abstract = {The present paper studies the effects of alternative modifications of a subsidy for electricity used to pump groundwater on the behavior of profit maximizing groundwater users. It proposes a stylized model for groundwater extraction, and then numerically derives general results by simulation. The model is applied to aquifers in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico and Kern County, California. The performance of two traditional policy intervention measures—subsidy elimination and reduction—are compared to a new, innovative modification policy, namely, decoupling the subsidy from the electricity bill; this policy is arguably more politically acceptable. The results of extensive simulations suggest that the rate of aquifer water extraction, and the consequent level of water in the aquifer, can be improved significantly by changing the subsidy structure.},

abstract = {Efficient irrigation water management has become a common goal for continued growth and sustainable development in both India and Australia. The two countries have followed definite paths for achieving the best irrigation management policy. Australia has adopted irrigation management transfer (IMT) with emphasis on privatisation, while India has focused on participatory irrigation management (PIM). Australia and India have adopted these approaches in one of their main river basins, namely the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and the Krishna Basin, respectively. Institutional reforms in irrigation management in the MDB developed independently of global progress in IMT as compared to the Krishna Basin where the reforms were imposed from the top. Further, irrigation management entities in the MDB, either under public or participatory domain, relied heavily on market-based instruments to achieve efficiency in irrigation water management. In contrast, PIM in the Krishna Basin in India appears to be an experiment with command and control in diverse legal and organisational settings across time and space. In summary, in terms of the parameters chosen in their nearest proximity to measure performance, the Australian IMT programme seems to have performed better than the Indian PIM programme.},

abstract = {Independently controlled irrigation plots were designed to test two container nursery irrigation regimes on oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia ‘Alice') in both nursery and controlled greenhouse environments. The experiments were conducted in both 3.8 and 11.4L containers. Plants were automatically irrigated by one of two soil moisture sensor-based regimes: (1) a daily water use (DWU) system that delivered the exact amount of water that had been lost in the previous 24h and (2) an on-demand (OD) irrigation system based on a specific substrate moisture content derived from the relationship between substrate moisture and photosynthetic rate. In this system, irrigation was applied when the substrate moisture level fell below 33{\%} container capacity, which corresponded to 90{\%} maximum predicted photosynthetic rate. Both treatments delivered the volume of water required to return the containers to container capacity by overhead irrigation, but the DWU system was static, irrigating once per day, whereas OD was dynamic and irrigated whenever the substrate moisture reached the 33{\%} threshold level. Gas exchange was measured at the driest point prior to the next irrigation event. Periodical growth index, water use, and final dry weight were recorded. OD used less water than DWU outdoors, reduced leaching fraction among greenhouse experiments, and had either no or a positive impact on biomass in all but one trial. For 3.8L plants, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were consistently greater when irrigated by the OD program. Both treatments used significantly less water than the industry standard of 2.5cm per day. This research demonstrated that both DWU and OD are a dramatic improvement over conventional irrigation scheduling and could be adopted as conservative irrigation systems for nursery production.},

abstract = {Farmers are increasingly selling their water rights to growing municipalities and abandoning their farms (buy and dry). A loss of food production in the midst of a growing population is a recipe for food shortages. There is a need for municipalities to meet their water demand from the water rights held by farmers while farmers continue to produce crops. One solution to prevent a ‘buy and dry' scenario is for farmers to lease a portion of their water rights to municipalities and continuing to farm under a deficit irrigation program. For this solution to work Colorado Water Law requires that return flows be maintained for down gradient water users. According to Colorado Water Law, deep percolation is any water in the unsaturated zone below the root zone (Colorado Foundation for Water Education, 2009). Deep percolation is also assumed to result in groundwater recharge.   The first objective of this study is to quantify deep percolation. The second objective is to determine an optimal deficit irrigation technique. The third objective is to evaluate the methods used to estimate deep percolation.    This study investigated three different cornfields (referred to as Blocks) in 2011 in Greeley, Colorado. Each block practices different flood irrigation techniques for the purpose of finding an optimal deficit irrigation plan. Block 2 practices traditional flood irrigation, Block 1 applies water at the same frequency as in Block 2 but uses half the volume of water, and Block 3 only irrigates twice during the growing season but applies large volumes of water per irrigation.    Three methods were used to estimate deep percolation in each block: Lysimeters, Unsaturated Zone Water Balance (UZWB), and Darcy Flux. At the same time as this study, the United States Department of Agriculture – Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) estimated deep percolation using a water balance method. The lysimeter method found an average deep percolation for Block 1 at 58mm, Block 2 at 334 mm, and Block 3 at 238 mm. The UZWB method found an average deep percolation for Block 1 at 291mm, Block 2 at 518 mm, and Block 3 at 516 mm. The Darcy flux method found an average deep percolation for Block 1 at 209 mm, Block 2 at 160 mm, and Block 3 at 1,246 mm. The USDA-ARS found an average deep percolation for Block 1 at 391 mm, Block 2 at 838 mm, and Block 3 at 635 mm. Corn was harvested by the USDA-ARS at the end of the season and yields were estimated. Block 1 produced 149 bushels/acre, Block 2 produced 196 bushels/acre, and Block 3 produced 84 bushels/acre.   All methods found the irrigation strategy applied to Block 3, in relation to the other Blocks, resulted in the greatest percentage of deep percolation compared to water applied. The lysimeter method determined that the irrigation plan used in Block 1 was the least efficient in creating deep percolation while the UZWB and Darcy Flux method found that the irrigation applied to Block 2 was the least efficient. Although Block 3 was the most effective in producing deep percolation it produced the least amount of corn.   The UZWB method was thought to be the most valuable method in this study. Installation of the neutron probe access tubes caused minimal disturbance to the soils and this method investigated the entire unsaturated zone below the zero flux plane, which accounted for most vertical heterogeneity. The lysimeter method was the most direct method, but installation caused extensive soil disturbances. However, once the soil settled over time the lysimeter method provided consistent and reliable results. In this study the Darcy Flux Method provided the greatest range in results compared to the other methods. The primary concern in using the estimates from this method was the quality of the data collected by the sensors.},

abstract = {A 'Kinnow' crop is grown in five growing regions of Punjab, Pakistan. A citrus crop management project is under way in Pakistan under the Australia aid program. As a part of the citrus Agriculture Sector Linkages Program (ASLP) project, an experiment was conducted in 2011 on a 25-year-old 'Kinnow' mandarin orchard at the Citrus Research Institute, Sargodha. The objective of the trial was to monitor the quantity of water used in furrow versus flood irrigation systems. The experiment also focused on yield and quality benefits of the furrow irrigation system. An orchard with an area of 0.41 ha (half for each system) was selected for this experiment. There were two treatments with three trees plot-1 replicated four times. Tensiometers were installed at 30, 60 and 90 cm soil depths to monitor the water levels in both furrow and flood systems. Irrigation was applied when tensiometer readings reached 40 kPa. Total quantity of irrigation water used was measured with a flume meter. The furrow irrigation system increased the yield by 18{\%} in terms of number of fruit plant-1 (864), fruit yield by 20{\%} (123 kg plant-1) and fruit size by 14{\%} (71 mm) compared with the flood irrigation system, where number of fruit plant-1, yield (kg plant-1) and fruit size (mm) were 705, 98 and 61, respectively. The furrow irrigation system proved beneficial in terms of water savings (41{\%}) as compared with flood irrigation, with the added benefit on yield and quality. This system needs to be further tested and adopted on a wider scale in commercial orchards in citrus growing regions of Punjab.},

Sensor-based irrigation scheduling methods (SBISM) measure soil moisture to allow scheduling of irrigation events based on the soil-water status. With rapid development of soil moisture sensors, more producers have become interested in SBISM, but interpretation of the sensor data is often difficult. Computer-based methods attempt to estimate soil water content and the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS) is one example of a weather-based irrigation scheduling tool that has been used in the Mid-South for many years. To aid producers and consultants interested in learning more about irrigation scheduling, field studies were conducted for two years in Mississippi and a year in Missouri to compare SBISM with the AIS. Soil moisture sensors (Decagon GS-1, Acclima TDR-315, Watermark 200SS) were installed in multiple locations of a soybean field (Mississippi) and cotton field (Missouri). Soil water contents of the fields were measured hourly at multiple depths during the growing seasons. The AIS was installed on a computer to estimate soil water content and the required data were obtained from nearby weather stations at both locations and manually entered in the program. In Mississippi, numbers and times of the irrigation events triggered by the SBISM were compared with those that would have been scheduled by the AIS. Results showed the number and time of irrigation events scheduled using the SBISM were often different from those predicted by the AIS, especially during the 2018 growing season. The highly variable soils at the Missouri site complicated the interpretation of the sensor values. While all of the sites were within the Tiptonville silt loam map unit, some of the measurements appeared to come from sandier soils. The AIS assumed more water entered the soil than the sensors indicated from both irrigations and rainfalls less than 25 mm. While the irrigation amounts were based on the pivot sprinkler chart, previous testing had confirmed the accuracy of the charts. Furthermore, the difference varied among sites, especially for rainfall large enough to cause runoff. The recommendations based on the Watermark sensors agreed fairly well with the AIS in July after the data from the sandiest site was omitted; however, the later irrigations called for by the AIS were not indicated by the sensors. Both the sensor-based irrigation scheduling method and the AIS could be used as tools for irrigation management in the Mid-South region, but with careful attention to soil texture and the effective portion of rainfall or irrigation.

abstract = {Several factors contribute to poor irrigation management. A set of natural, social, environmental, institutional and technological variables can collectively result in complex and messy problems. Traditional engineering systems are not well suited for addressing coupled and interlinked types of problem. To this end, a hybrid network model is introduced to study the cumulative impact of these variables on the performance of irrigation projects. The model is based on the theory of complex adaptive systems and agent‐based modelling. The Gezira scheme in Sudan is used as a case study in order to convert the vicious circle through adopting an improved and most viable irrigation management system. Six key variables are selected as dominant driving forces that influence the performance of the irrigation scheme. These are scheme governance, agricultural research, agricultural inputs and technologies, farmers, water user associations and the irrigation agency responsible for operation and maintenance. The scope of the analysis is to explore the dynamics of system enhancement under different scenarios of policy intervention. The results revealed the need for balanced and diversified investment in all entities to ensure sustainable growth. The findings emphasize the importance of having interventions with moderate growth patterns that seek to enhance cooperation and positive feedback among entities.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Plusieurs facteurs contribuent {\`{a}} une mauvaise gestion de l'irrigation.

We hypothesize that environmental introduction concentrations (EICs) of drugs in the Mexico City–Mezquital Valley wastewater irrigation system can be estimated using information on water consumption, sales data, and excretion rates. EICs of six acidic and five basic drugs were calculated and compared with concentrations measured in wastewater, irrigation water, soil drainage, and springs by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS/MS). EICs of trimethoprim, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in sewage equaled or exceeded the US FDA action limit of 1$\mu$g/L for detailed environmental risk assessment (ERA). Concentrations of clarithromycin, clindamycin, metoprolol, sulfasalazine, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil were smaller. Calculated EICs of all compounds except metoprolol and clarithromycin were comparable to measured concentrations if excretion rates were considered. Whereas concentrations of basic compounds with positive or neutral charges were effectively reduced during reservoir storage and soil passage, acidic, anionic compounds were hardly retained. Though realistic EICs can be predicted for most substances, large deviations between EICs and measured concentrations in the case of metoprolol illustrate that estimated concentrations cannot substitute for monitoring programs.},

Its importance is likely to grow under the influence of global climate change. The use of this resource is not, however, without health risk which is difficult to estimate using data from standard microbial and physicochemical monitoring alone. A health risk management system enables risk reduction through hazard identification, risk characterisation and analysis, strategy development and implementation, intervention assessment and risk communication. In this process data from both risk assessment and routine technological monitoring are integrated to yield synergies. In addition to meaningful information is a need for intersectoral collaboration in making the right decisions. This can be achieved through the establishment of a multidisciplinary risk management team with members drawn from communities of practice.

abstract = {Flood-based farming is among the potential options in ensuring access to water for crop and livestock production for small-scale farmers in the arid and semiarid lowlands of sub-Saharan Africa, and Ethiopia in particular. Flood-based irrigation while inexpensive is rooted in tradition in many rural communities which is in contrast to many other irrigation types which are unavailable (in terms of water source, technology or capacity) or are costly to develop. Spate irrigation has been practiced in different parts of Ethiopia for many decades, but it was only recently that it gained the government$\backslash$u2019s attention. This study was conducted through a review and informal discussion with the objectives of documenting the current status, trends and prospects of spate irrigation in the country and the associated challenges, taking cases of selected schemes in different regional states. The study revealed that spate irrigation is expanding either through improvement of traditional schemes or by developing new ones. Neither the traditional nor modern schemes are free of challenges. The traditional schemes suffer from floods that damage their diversion structures, while poor design and construction of diversion structures have led to the failure of new ones. A range of socio-technical improvements in the planning, implementation and operation of schemes is proposed, including the design of headworks and canals consistent with the size and nature of expected flows, structures to minimize sedimentation, building capacity of farmers and district officers, and monitoring and improving the management that currently adversely impacts the performance of the schemes. Consulting farmers at every stage of the development, and building the capacity of engineers to deal with the unique nature of spate flows are the most likely interventions to ensure successful agricultural production using spate irrigation.},

abstract = {The development of small-scale surface-water irrigation facilities in rainfed agricultural regions is a necessary but problematic task. Whilst some academic literature recognises that water control problems are the locally specific outcomes of social and political histories and processes, this is yet to be adequately comprehended and internalised in irrigation policy discourse and its manifestations in state and NGO intervention practices, which too often seek standardised and generally applicable solutions to such problems. This thesis, through a detailed study of smallscale surface-water irrigation systems - three recent NGO-led, state-sanctioned lift irrigation interventions and four indigenous storage works - and historical and present-day social relations amongst three adivasi (tribal) communities in south-east Jharkhand State, examines this insight and its significance for policy. Present-day international irrigation policy discourse has shifted since the 1980s and 1990s from one which recognised the necessity of group-based small-scale irrigation development and thus sought to provide support to the resource poor, towards one which promotes smaller, noncommunal technologies, expects greater financial contributions from farmers, and thus implicitly favours relatively wealthier farmers. This ideological policy shift, promoted internationally and nationally under neo-liberalism, is legitimised by the perceived poor outcomes of irrigation development investments. In Jharkhand, blame is placed upon water-users whose organisation for irrigation system management is often lacking, yet such outcomes have been aided by the state - which has in innumerable ways failed to support farmers, and by NGOs' inability to monitor and self-critically analyse their own interventions. This thesis, by conceptualising irrigation and society as mutually constitutive rather than autonomous, demonstrates the potential viability of small-scale irrigation technologies and argues for the development of irrigation centred upon improving irrigation water access and system management for the resource poor majority, not just a minority. This thesis takes an anthropological and sociological approach to the study of irrigation and society, which provides balance to the otherwise dominant technocratic engineering and common property resources and new institutional economics approaches in contemporary irrigation management thinking. Emphasis is placed on the historical processes that determine irrigation resource access and rights, and on the formal and informal rules that create and reinforce unequal access to irrigation systems. Methodologically it favours a sociological-historical method; research was conducted combining ethnographic methods with physical field measurements and archival research. The sociotechnical approach to irrigation, utilised by Boelens and Mollinga, places centrally the concepts of control and power, allowing an exploration of the political dimensions of water control - normative (discourse), technical (infrastructure), organisational (management), socio-legal and socio-economic (access), whilst allowing consideration of irrigation systems' social dimensions - as social constructions, having social requirements for use, and having social effects. Such a perspective indicates the necessity of inclusive, group-based irrigation development interventions, focussed on communities in their entirety, integrating with their socio-productive systems, and striving for equitable outcomes. In the medium and long term this may aid system sustainability thus increasing total food production.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTIONRadiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis is a serious side effect of radiation therapy. Anemia requiring transfusion can ensue. Treatment methods include bladder irrigation, fulguration, and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy. Failure of treatment leads to cystectomy associated with a high risk of severe complications (42{\%}) and mortality (16{\%}). Continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) is often required to prevent further clot formation. HBO2 supports the healing process of radiation cystitis. In patients requiring CBI, the time in HBO2 can help cause clot accumulation and obstruction. We describe a method of providing CBI in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber.MATERIALS AND METHODSAn IV to catheter adapter is used, allowing an IV pump to control CBI flow into the chamber. Drainage is collected in an extra-large (2- to 5-liter) bag. The rate is set so the volume does not exceed the bag's capacity. The bag is placed in a manner that precludes spilling and allows monitoring of outflow.RESULTSCBI was successfully maintained. Brief cases are presented and issues discussed.SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONSCBI is easily maintained in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber, with readily available equipment allowing for uninterrupted CBI of hemorrhagic cystitis. HBO2 helps mitigate the potential side effects of other interventions in a previously irradiated area.},

The ensuing rural transformation reminds one of earlier periods in the development of the irrigation system: the central control over production, and the very high level of agricultural inputs and mechanisation, remind one of the state socialist period, while the removal of smallholders from their land and its concentration in the hands of a few bears a strong resemblance to the scheme's establishment under colonial rule.},

abstract = {The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features – indicative of reduction-oxidation processes – were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers {\~{}}0.4 to {\~{}}4dSm−1) and drier (water level{\textgreater}−1.5m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers {\~{}}2 to {\~{}}9dSm−1 and water level between −1m depth and +0.2m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh{\textgreater}+500mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic ({\~{}}+100mV{\textless}Eh{\textless}{\~{}}+350mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh{\textless}{\~{}}+100mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem.},

abstract = {Foodborne outbreaks have been associated with the use of irrigation water contaminated with human and animal wastes. The use of subsurface drip irrigation may reduce the contamination of leafy green produce. The goal of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of a subsurface irrigation system on the contamination of romaine lettuce contaminated with a fecal bacterium and a virus. Plants were transplanted and grown in bottom watering pots. They were irrigated with contaminated water containing Escherichia coli and MS2 bacterial virus. The HYDRUS 2D/3D program was used to model the water movement in the soil to ensure that the soil surface did not become wet and consequently contaminated. Neither E. coli nor MS2 were detected on the surface or internally on/in romaine lettuce. The results demonstrated that subsurface irrigation may successfully reduce the risk of contamination by bacterial and viral pathogens so long as the contaminated irrigation water does not reach the soil surface and thereby come in direct contact with the aboveground portions of the plant.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new explicit stochastic hydro‐economic optimization model for reservoir‐irrigation district systems design affected by multiple interdependent sources of uncertainties. The model solution determines both optimal design and long‐term operation policies of the systems while accounting for uncertainties of reservoir inflow, rainfall, crop yield, crop price, and production costs. The problem is formulated as a chance‐constrained program in which the dependence structure of discrete and continuous random coefficients is accounted for using copula. In addition to design variables such as the sizing of reservoir capacity and the irrigable area, optimal reservoir operation policies and irrigation management strategies are determined. The model performance and significance is tested in the case study of Chamshir hydrosystem in Iran, consisting of Chamshir Dam and downstream irrigation districts. Various scenarios assessing baseline conditions, risk attitude, and the impacts of change in climatic inputs and upstream conditions are also evaluated. The model results are used to quantify the interrelationships and trade‐offs among optimal values of design parameters, optimal irrigation policy, decision‐makers' risk‐attitude, uncertainty levels of agro‐economic factors, and target reliability levels of meeting crop yield and water requirement. The results demonstrate that smaller sizes of the reservoir and the irrigation district and stress‐avoidance irrigation policies, rather than deficit‐irrigation policies, are preferred when the decision maker is risk‐averse and uncertainties in agro‐economic factors and reliability levels are large. Additionally, we show how the optimal cropping pattern and irrigation strategies are affected by climate change‐induced rainfall variations and the alteration of conditions upstream of the project.},

abstract = {This study presents an explicit stochastic optimization-simulation model of short-term deficit irrigation management for large-scale irrigation districts. The model which is a nonlinear nonconvex program with an economic objective function is built on an agrohydrological simulation component. The simulation component integrates (1) an explicit stochastic model of soil moisture dynamics of the crop-root zone considering interaction of stochastic rainfall and irrigation with shallow water table effects, (2) a conceptual root zone salt balance model, and 3) the FAO crop yield model. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, linked to the simulation component, solves the resulting nonconvex program with a significantly better computational performance compared to a Monte Carlo-based implicit stochastic optimization model. The model has been tested first by applying it in single-crop irrigation problems through which the effects of the severity of water deficit on the objective function (net benefit), root-zone water balance, and irrigation water needs have been assessed. Then, the model has been applied in Dasht-e-Abbas and Ein-khosh Fakkeh Irrigation Districts (DAID and EFID) of the Karkheh Basin in southwest of Iran. While the maximum net benefit has been obtained for a stress-avoidance (SA) irrigation policy, the highest water profitability has been resulted when only about 60{\%} of the water used in the SA policy is applied. The DAID with respectively 33{\%} of total cultivated area and 37{\%} of total applied water has produced only 14{\%} of the total net benefit due to low-valued crops and adverse soil and shallow water table conditions. Key Points * An explicit stochastic model of deficit irrigation is developed. * The stochastic deficit irrigation model is coupled with an optimization model. * A multi-crop irrigation scheduling optimization model is developed.},

abstract = {The availability of a process-based coupled surface-subsurface model can lead to improved surface irrigation/fertigation management practices. In this study, a one-dimensional zero-inertia model is coupled with a one-dimensional unsaturated zone water-flow model: HYDRUS-1D. A driver program is used to effect internal iterative coupling of the surface and subsurface flow models. Flow depths calculated using the surface-flow model are used as Dirichlet boundary conditions for the subsurface-flow model, and infiltration amounts calculated by the subsurface model are in turn used in surface-flow mass balance calculations. The model was tested by using field data collected at the University of Arizona, Yuma Mesa, research farm. The maximum mean absolute difference between field-observed and model-predicted advance is 2 min. Applications of the coupled model in improved irrigation management are highlighted. In addition, the significance of the effects of soil moisture redistribution on irrigation water availability to crops and the capability of the coupled model in tracking those changes in soil water status over time are discussed using examples.},

abstract = {Surface fertigation is widely practiced in irrigated crop production systems. Lack of design and management tools limits the effectiveness of surface fertigation practices. The availability of a process-based coupled surface-subsurface hydraulic and solute transport model can lead to improved surface fertigation management. This paper presents the development of a coupled surface-subsurface solute transport model. A hydraulic model described in a previous paper by the writers provided the hydrodynamic basis for the solute transport model presented here. A numerical solution of the area averaged advection-dispersion equation, based on the split-operator approach, forms the surface solute transport component of the coupled model. The subsurface transport process is simulated using HYDRUS-1D, which also solves the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. A driver program is used for the internal coupling of the surface and subsurface transport models. Solute fluxes calculated using the surface transport model are used as upper boundary conditions for the subsurface model. Evaluation of the model is presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the possibility of a crop water stress index (CWSI) to schedule irrigation for broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) grown with drip irrigation during the spring and autumn cultivation periods of 2007. The effects of five irrigation levels which were applied based on a ratio of Class A pan evaporation (kcp=0, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25) with 7 days interval on broccoli yields and resulting CWSl were investigated. The highest yield and water use was obtained in the treatment of applied 50{\%} of the evaporation measured in Class A pan for two seasons, while the effects of irrigation programs on yield was not statistically significant. The seasonal evapotranspiration in the treatments varied from 187 to 326mm during the spring period and from 242 to 346mm during the autumn period. The CWSI was calculated using the empirical approach from measurements of infrared canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values for five irrigation levels. An average threshold CWSI value of about 0.51 before irrigation produced the maximum yield. The yield was directly correlated with mean CWSI values and the linear equation “Y=−36.51(CWSI)2+32.958(CWSI)+0.772” with a determination coefficient R2=0.99 and standard deviation Syx=1.38Mgha−1 can be used for yield prediction. The soil water content, soil matric potential, above ground biomass and leaf area index values were also found to correlate better with CWSI as a key function for modeling the crop growth model. The CWSI value was useful for evaluating crop water stress in broccoli and should be useful for timing irrigation and predicting yield.},

The main aims were to characterise crop productivity and develop the drought response factor Ky and the crop yield production functions in relation to rainfall and irrigation (P+I) and to total water-use (ETc), that could be used to assess the benefits of irrigation and fertilisation practices in the region. ETc was monitored by intensive field measurement of soil water content using a neutron probe device. Single values of total water applied (P+I) ranged from 148 to 387mm in 1988 and from 295 to 724mm in 1989. By contrast, single values of ETc (including the contribution from soil water storage), ranged from 230 to 504mm in 1988 and from 330 to 802mm in 1989. Full irrigation increased mean yields of fresh tubers from 11.8 to 24.7t/ha in 1988 and from 13.6 to 49.8t/ha in 1989. Total fresh tuber yield from droughted crops tended to decline with increasing N fertiliser up to 80kg/ha. Yield responses to P+I (52–91kg/(hamm)) and to ETc (62–105kg/(hamm)) varied with fertiliser application. In both years, the relative values of Ky were similar for all three fertilised crops (N1, N2 and N3) regardless of nitrogen dosage. The mean Ky value in 1988 was 0.71 and 1.12 in 1989.},

abstract = {Background   Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in Kenya as well as in many other tropical countries and is considered one of the most prevalent diseases in the rural population. Between 2004 and 2009, primary school children in Mwea irrigation scheme were treated for Schistosoma mansoni. In the four year control programme, there was occurrence of light re-infection with S. mansoni. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the current prevalence of S. mansoni, infection two years after the withdrawal of mass drug administration (MDA) programme.   Methods   We carried out a cross-sectional study on a population of 387 children attending 3 primary schools located in Mwea irrigation scheme. Children, aged 8-16 years were interviewed and screened for S. mansoni using duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears. Comparisons of prevalence by age group and gender were tested for significance on the basis of the Wald test. Best prediction factors for infection with S. mansoni were selected using forward - stepwise variable selection method.   Results   The overall prevalence of S. mansoni was 53.7 {\%}, (95{\%}CI: 49.0-59.0, p-value = 0.000). Male children had higher prevalence of infection, 66.1 {\%} (95{\%}CI: 59.8-73.2, p-value = 0.000) compared to females. The gender (sex) of a child was the only factor reported to be significantly associated with S. mansoni infection, (OR = 1.9, p-value = 0.015, 95{\%}CI: 1.13-3.21).   Conclusions   There was high prevalence of S. mansoni infections in the study area, two years after the withdrawal of MDA programme. We suggest that treatment should be continued in the school children at regular intervals, monitoring and surveillance intensified to ensure interruption of transmission areas.},

abstract = {Water management is becoming commonplace in discussions of high-yield farming and modern agricultural best practices. A field experiment undertaken in the Northern region of Egypt, Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, with four cut-off furrow irrigation treatments (100{\%}, full irrigation – considered as a control; 90{\%}, 80{\%} and 70{\%} of strip length) was used to compare the effects of reduced water supply on onion (Allium cepa, L.) production via assessing three different cultivars (e.g., Giza red, Giza 20 and Behairy red). A strip-plot design with three replicates was employed in this regard during two successive seasons (2014–2015/2015–2016). Regardless of onion type, water supply at 80{\%} level resulted in higher marketable and total bulb yield (t/ha) with improved quality traits and storability compared to other irrigation treatments. There have been few significant interspecies differences. The most notable significant differences were recorded in Giza red and Behairy red for all studied characteristics. The highest results were reached with Giza red under the use of 80{\%} irrigation level. In addition to the excellence in improving the overall quality and harvestable yield, this treatment (80{\%} watering) has produced relatively good results with respect to the consumptive water-use efficiency, water productivity and showed significant benefits in terms of saving irrigation water. Maximum water saving was obtained under the use of 70{\%} irrigation treatment, but in the absence of a good and economically unacceptable yield. The traditional technique (100{\%} water supply) consumed much water, surpassing the most effective treatment (80{\%}) by 1195.77 cubic meter per hectare (i.e., 11.96 cm in depth/height). In conclusion, cut-off irrigation technique is considered an efficient and effective intervention approach for onion yield increases while maintaining post-harvesting quality and water savings. However, extending the study beyond onion is critical to increase the range of benefit with regard to other crops, as well for adequate management of water under deficit irrigation conditions.},

abstract = {Essay 1: Cover crop and no-till adoption: What affects willingness to accept of cover crop and no-till contracts?Carbon markets offer supplemental income to producers for implementing no-till and cover crop practices that sequester carbon in the soil. Using choice experiments, we find that 37{\%} and 43{\%} of our sample would not accept a hypothetical contract to enroll cover crop and no-till respectively, indicating that producers are unwilling to enroll in carbon contract offerings current payment rates. We estimate the marginal willingness to accept (MWTA) of producers for current contract attributes including contract length and portion of cropland enrolled for both cover crop and no-till. Using random parameters logit models, we find that MWTA of a cover crop contract for enrolling 33{\%} of cropland acreage for a 5- and 10-year contract is {\$}54.44/acre and {\$}75.85/acre, or two to three times current program payments. We find comparable results with lower prices for no-till contracts. In addition to indications that current payments are too low to incentivize widespread adoption, we find that MWTA of contracts increases with contract length because contractual agreements constrain producer decision making. We also find indications that arid regions may not receive enough precipitation for cover crop implementation which causes higher MWTA of cover crop contracts. Results indicate that conservation practices and payments under existing carbon contracts will limit enrollment in Kansas and other semi-arid regions of the High Plains.Essay 2: Producer response to groundwater quality concerns: Are concerned producers watering less? Increases in irrigation intensity across the High Plains Aquifer have led to declining water levels and deterioration of water quality due to runoff and salts accumulation. In this paper, we combine a survey of producer groundwater perceptions with data on groundwater use to determine how ground water quantity and quality concerns affect irrigation water use. We find that as well yield (i.e., water quantity) concern increases, producers typically irrigate a smaller number of acres at each well which results in less total water use. However, we find that major concern over water quality corresponds with an increase of water use which is driven by producers watering more acres on the extensive margin. Our results indicate that water quality concerns mitigate the declines in irrigation water use caused by well yield concerns. When major water quality concern is present, producers apply 11.45 more acre-feet of water per well. We do not find significant changes in water use on the intensive margin due to well yield or water quality concerns. In looking at the effects of water quality concern on crop choice, we find that the planting decisions of producers with water quality concerns are not statistically different from producers without concern, which indicates producers are not changing their crop choice on average due to concern over water quality.},

abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) is an agronomic management system based on zero tillage and residue retention. Due to its potential for climate change adaptation through the reduction of soil erosion and improved water availability, CA is becoming more important in many regions of the world. However, increased bulk density and large amounts of crop residues may be a constraint for early plant establishment. This holds especially true under irrigated production areas with high yield potential. Genotype × tillage effects on yield are not well understood and it is unclear whether tillage should be an evaluation factor in breeding programs. Fourteen CIMMYT bread (Triticum aestivum) and thirteen durum (Triticum turgidum) wheat genotypes, created between 1964 and 2011, were tested for yield and agronomic performance at CIMMYT's experimental station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during nine seasons. The genotypes were subjected to different tillage and irrigation treatments which consisted of conventional and permanent raised beds with full and reduced irrigation. The dataset includes traits collected during the growing period (days to emergence, days to flowering, maturity, plant height, NDVI, days from flowering to maturity, grain production rate) and at harvest (yield, harvest index, thousand grain weight, spikes/m², grains/m², test weight) and weather data (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall). Six years of data of 26 genotypes were published along with the Honsdorf et al. (2018) paper in Field Crops Research (DOI: s10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.011). This updated dataset includes three additional seasons of data (harvest years 2016 to 2018) and an additional bread wheat genotype (Borlaug100).},

abstract = {This dissertation contains two collections of analyses, both broadly focused on energy system planning, but motivated by different research objectives in distinct geographic settings. Part I – Chapters I-III – evaluates decarbonization strategies in New York. These studies are characteristic of the primary energy-related challenge faced by the Global North: How can states cost-effectively meet time-bound emissions reduction targets? A series of linear programs are developed to answer this question, culminating in the System Electrification and Capacity TRansition (SECTR) model, a high-fidelity representation of the New York State energy system that characterizes statewide emissions and allows for comparative study of various decarbonization pathways. SECTR simulations indicate that prioritizing heating and vehicle electrification alongside an expansion of instate wind and solar generation capacity allows New York to meet recently legislated climate goals more affordably than through approaches that mandate substantial low-carbon electricity targets. Additional work also explores the optimal distribution of energy infrastructure within New York to meet specified decarbonization targets, along with the value of supply-side, demand-side, and bidirectional methods of system flexibility.Part II of this dissertation – Chapters IV-VII – is concerned with the energy system challenges faced by the lowest income countries. Set in the Ethiopian Highlands, this work first aims to locate smallholder irrigated areas, as irrigation has attendant energy requirements that are larger and more likely to generate supplementary sources of revenue compared to residential demands. Here, a novel classification methodology is developed to collect labeled data, train a machine learning-based irrigation detection model, and understand the spatial extent of model applicability. Across isolated plots of land as small as 30m by 30m, the resulting model achieves {\textgreater}95{\%} prediction accuracy. Further studies then explore the system planning implications of simulated electricity demands associated with these irrigated areas.},

@phdthesis{AraralJr2006,
abstract = {In the 1970's, the Philippines embarked on a program to decentralize the management of public irrigation. Early studies have shown that these reforms led to consistently positive results and earned widespread international documentation and recognition as a role model. Twenty years later, however, an examination of the program now indicates problems of poor performance. How could poor performance occur in a system known worldwide for its major decentralization efforts? How are the incentives faced by key irrigation players linked to performance? What factors may have influenced these incentives? These questions build on the literature of decentralization, collective action, bureaucracies, foreign aid, common pool resources and irrigation institutions in developing countries. To explain this puzzle, I hypothesize that, first, irrigation performance is linked to inherent incentive problems faced by public agencies. Second, these incentive problems can be aggravated by the incentives embedded in foreign aid particularly by the moral hazard problem. Third, I argue that performance is also a function of the incentives faced by farmers as shaped by their physical, social and institutional context. I examine the hypothesis on bureaucratic and foreign aid incentives using panel data describing the performance of the irrigation agency. To test my hypotheses about farmer's incentives, I examined a cross section data on 2,056 irrigation associations. I examined archives, conducted field work from 2003-2005 and employed key informant interviews, focus group discussions, photo-documentation, participant- observation and focused on conceptual and measurement reliability issues. My findings confirm my hypotheses. I find that irrigation performance in the Philippines is characterized by a cycle of chronic underinvestment in maintenance, deterioration of facilities, poor water service, low productivity and poor farm incomes. Bureaucratic self interest drives the problem of underinvestment in maintenance and can be aggravated by incentives embedded in foreign aid. Underinvestment is also driven by farmer's incentives to free ride which differs between labor and monetary contribution. Finally, I find how different configurations of physical, social and institutional factors have different effects on farmer incentives. The study has implications for 25 developing countries undertaking irrigation reforms and faced with the same issues of poor performance and incentive problems.},

abstract = {In the 1970's, the Philippines embarked on a program to decentralize the management of public irrigation. Early studies have shown that these reforms led to consistently positive results and earned widespread international documentation and recognition as a role model. Twenty years later, however, an examination of the program now indicates problems of poor performance.    How could poor performance occur in a system known worldwide for its major decentralization efforts? How are the incentives faced by key irrigation players linked to performance? What factors may have influenced these incentives? These questions build on the literature of decentralization, collective action, bureaucracies, foreign aid, common pool resources and irrigation institutions in developing countries.    To explain this puzzle, I hypothesize that, first, irrigation performance is linked to inherent incentive problems faced by public agencies. Second, these incentive problems can be aggravated by the incentives embedded in foreign aid particularly by the moral hazard problem. Third, I argue that performance is also a function of the incentives faced by farmers as shaped by their physical, social and institutional context.    I examine the hypothesis on bureaucratic and foreign aid incentives using panel data describing the performance of the irrigation agency. To test my hypotheses about farmer's incentives, I examined a cross section data on 2,056 irrigation associations. I examined archives, conducted field work from 2003–2005 and employed key informant interviews, focus group discussions, photo-documentation, participant-observation and focused on conceptual and measurement reliability issues.    My findings confirm my hypotheses. I find that irrigation performance in the Philippines is characterized by a cycle of chronic underinvestment in maintenance, deterioration of facilities, poor water service, low productivity and poor farm incomes. Bureaucratic self interest drives the problem of underinvestment in maintenance and can be aggravated by incentives embedded in foreign aid. Underinvestment is also driven by farmer's incentives to free ride which differs between labor and monetary contribution. Finally, I find how different configurations of physical, social and institutional factors have different effects on farmer incentives.    The study has implications for 25 developing countries undertaking irrigation reforms and faced with the same issues of poor performance and incentive problems.},

abstract = {The stiff competition for water between agriculture and non-agricultural production sectors makes it necessary to have effective management of irrigation networks in farms. However, the process of selecting flow control structures in irrigation networks is highly complex and involves different levels of decision makers. In this paper, we apply multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodology to develop a decision analysis (DA) framework for evaluating, ranking and selecting check and intake structures for irrigation canals. The DA framework consists of identifying relevant attributes for canal structures, developing a robust scoring system for alternatives, identifying a procedure for data quality control, and identifying a MADM model for the decision analysis. An application is illustrated through an analysis for automation purposes of the Qazvin irrigation network, one of the oldest and most complex irrigation networks in Iran. A survey questionnaire designed based on the decision framework was distributed to experts, managers, and operators of the Qazvin network and to experts from the Ministry of Power in Iran. Five check structures and four intake structures were evaluated. A decision matrix was generated from the average scores collected from the survey, and was subsequently solved using TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. To identify the most critical structure attributes for the selection process, optimal attribute weights were calculated using Entropy method. For check structures, results show that the duckbill weir is the preferred structure while the pivot weir is the least preferred. Use of the duckbill weir can potentially address the problem with existing Amil gates where manual intervention is required to regulate water levels during periods of flow extremes. For intake structures, the Neyrpic{\textregistered} gate and constant head orifice are the most and least preferred alternatives, respectively. Some advantages of the Neyrpic{\textregistered} gate are ease of operation and capacity to measure discharge flows. Overall, the application to the Qazvin irrigation network demonstrates the utility of the proposed DA framework in selecting appropriate structures for regulating water flows in irrigation canals. This framework systematically aids the decision process by capturing decisions made at various levels (individual farmers to high-level management). It can be applied to other cases where a new irrigation network is being designed, or where changes in irrigation structures need to be identified to improve flow control in existing networks.},

abstract = {Background  Long-term use of indwelling urethral catheters is associated with high risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and blockage, which may in turn cause significant morbidity and reduce the life of the catheter. A 0.02{\%} polyhexanide irrigation solution has been developed for routine mechanical rinsing together with bacterial decolonization of suprapubic and indwelling urethral catheters. Methods Using a practice-like in vitro assay and standard silicon catheters, artificially contaminated with clinically relevant bacteria, experiments were carried out to evaluate the bacterial decolonization potential of polyhexanide vs. 1) no intervention (standard approach) and 2) irrigation with a saline (NaCl 0.9{\%}) solution. Swabbing and irrigation was used to extract the bacteria. Results Irrigation with polyhexanide reduced the microbial population vs. the control catheters by a factor of 1.64 log10 (swab extraction) and by a factor of 2.56 log10 (membrane filtration). The difference in mean microbial counts between the two groups (0.90) was statistically significant in favor of polyhexanide when the liquid extraction method was used (p = 0.034). The difference between the two groups using the swab extraction method did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions The saline and polyhexanide solutions are able to reduce bacterial load of catheters, which shows a combined mechanical and antimicrobial effect. Further research is required to evaluate the long-term tolerability and efficacy of polyhexanide in clinical practice.},

abstract = {The olive tree is a traditionally nonirrigated crop that occupies quite
an extensive agricultural area in Mediterranean-type agroecosystems.
Improvements in water-use efficiency of crops are essential under the
scenarios of water scarcity predicted by global change models for the
Mediterranean region. Recently, irrigation has been introduced to
increase the low land productivity, but there is little information on
ecophysiological aspects and quality features intended for a sagacious
use of water, while being of major importance for the achievement of
high-quality products as olive oil. Therefore, deficit irrigation
programmes were developed to improve water-use efficiency, crop
productivity and quality in a subhumid zone of Southern Italy with good
winter-spring precipitation. The response of mature olive trees to
deficit irrigation in deep soils was studied on cultivars Frantoio and
Leccino by examining atmospheric environment and soil moisture, gas
exchange and plant water status, as well as oil yield and chemical
analysis. Trees were not irrigated (rainfed) or subjected to irrigation
at 66{\%} and 100{\%} of crop evapotranspiration (ETC), starting from pit
hardening to early fruit veraison. Improvements in the photosynthetic
capacity induced by increasing soil water availability were only of
minor importance. However, plant water status was positively influenced
by deficit irrigation, with 66{\%} and 100{\%} of ETC treatments hardly
differing from one another though consistently diverging from rainfed
plants. The effect of water stress on photosynthesis was mainly
dependent on diffusion resistances in response to soil moisture. Leccino
showed higher instantaneous water-use efficiency than Frantoio. Crop
yield increased proportionally to the amount of seasonal water volume,
confirming differences between cultivars in water-use efficiency. The
unsaturated/saturated and the monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acid
ratios of the oil also differed between cultivars, while the watering
regime had minor effects. Although irrigation can modify the fatty acid
profile, polyphenol contents were scarcely affected by the water supply.
Irrigation to 100{\%} of ETC in the period August-September might be
advisable to achieve high-quality yields, while saving consistent
amounts of water.},

abstract = {Water resources are increasingly limited and less available, so improving water use efficiency is particularly pressing in the agricultural sector, where inefficient irrigation systems are often in operation. Drip irrigation is one of the most water-saving systems that can optimize distribution according to the actual needs of the crop. In the present study, an engineered drip irrigation system was applied to a poplar crop dedicated to the production of biomass for energy use. The aim was to evaluate the influence of the supply of different volumes of irrigation water on crop growth. Four levels of water supply were tested (theses T1, T2, T3, and T4), each determined by different intervention thresholds established by using four soil moisture sensors, one for each thesis (PLOT) (20, 30, 40, and 50 percent, respectively). In the third growing season, the effect of the different amounts of irrigation water supplied on plant growth was particularly evident between control T1 (104 m3 ha−1) compared with T2 (540 m3 ha−1), T3 (1924 m3 ha−1) and T4 (4549 m3 ha−1). Regarding biomass production, no statistical differences were found between T2 (8.97 Mg DM ha−1 year−1), T3 (9.99 Mg DM ha−1 year−1) and T4 (10.02 Mg DM ha−1 year−1), but they were all different from T1 (7.09 Mg DM ha−1 year−1. This leads to the conclusion, at least up to the third growing season, that with equal satisfactory levels of biomass production, water and energy savings can be achieved by choosing intermediate levels of water supply (e.g., with the sensor at 30{\%}) as compared to the maximum value tested.},

abstract = {Oilseed brassicas are extensively grown in the water‐stressed ecologies of India. Sufficient irrigation, deficit irrigation scheduling (DIS) with limited irrigation water and rainfed (no irrigation) conditions were assessed with and without the use of superabsorbent polymer‐hydrogel (SAP‐hydrogel) under a micro‐sprinkler irrigation system (MIS) for Indian mustard. Irrigation scheduling at an irrigation water/cumulative pan evaporation ratio (IW/CPE) of 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4, along with use of SAP‐hydrogel, produced almost equal dry matter per plant (113, 115 and 109 g plant−1), which was, however, significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) over rainfed (86 g plant−1). The seed yield under DIS (0.6 IW/CPE) increased by 39.3{\%} over rainfed + hydrogel (HG). Also, the seed yield obtained under irrigation scheduling at a ratio of 0.4 IW/CPE was found to be similar to that obtained in rainfed + HG treatment. A similar water productivity (WP) of 10 kg ha−1 mm−1 was obtained with DIS at 0.4 IW/CPE + HG and at 0.8 IW/CPE‐HG; however, a higher total water productivity (WPt) was recorded under DIS at 0.6 and 0.4 IW/CPE + HG (23 and 29 kg ha−1 mm−1, respectively) over the same irrigation schedules excluding HG. The economics of HG application under DIS was better due to higher net returns, although the highest B : C ratio (1.92) was recorded in DIS (0.4 IW/CPE), trailed by irrigation scheduling at IW/CPE 0.8 and 0.6. Overall, it could be concluded that DIS through micro‐sprinkler and use of HG enhanced seed, oil, water productivity and energy dynamics under water‐constrained conditions in semi‐arid ecologies. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Les graines ol{\'{e}}agineuses brassicac{\'{e}}es sont largement cultiv{\'{e}}es dans les {\'{e}}cologies indiennes soumises {\`{a}} un stress hydrique.

abstract = {When looking at the domestic wastewater streams, from freshwater source to destination in an agricultural field, we are confronted with a complexity of issues that need careful attention. Social and economic realities arise, along with technical, biological and institutional issues. Local realities are linked to the geophysical environment, economic development and cultural context and may have an overriding impact on the necessity, enthusiasm and willingness to adopt a policy to place wastewater irrigation on the agenda as an option to save water, to fight environmental pollution and to support agricultural production. It is, therefore, not realistic to propose a design for wastewater use in irrigation that is globally applicable. Yet, considering the issues raised, it is increasingly feasible and informative to present a conceptual framework that should help to structure information and design options. Such a framework guides the designer as well as the researcher and acts as an instrument to keep an overview on alternative options, while local realities will be a reason for different design decisions.Original Abstract: Lorsque l'on observe les courants d'eaux residuaires domestiques, provenant des sources d'eaux potables a destination d'un champ agricole, nous nous retrouvons face a un ensemble de questions qui necessitent une attention toute particuliere. Des realites sociales et economiques apparaissent, liees a des problemes techniques, biologiques et institutionnels. Les realites locales sont liees a l'environnement geophysique, au developpement economique et au contexte culturel et peut avoir un impact primordial sur la necessite, l'enthousiasme et la volonte d'adopter une politique ayant pour objectif de mettre l'irrigation des eaux residuaires a l'ordre du jour en tant qu'alternative a la preservation de l'eau, afin de combattre la pollution environnementale et de soutenir la production agricole. C'est pour cette raison qu'il n'apparait pas comme realiste de proposer un programme pour l'utilisation des eaux residuaires dans l'irrigation qui pourrait s'appliquer au niveau mondial. Neanmoins, au regard des problemes abordes, il est de plus en plus realisable et instructif de presenter un cadre conceptuel qui devrait aider a structurer l'information et a planifier les options. Un tel cadre permet d'orienter le programmeur ainsi que le chercheur et agit comme un outil permettant de garder un vue d'ensemble sur les options alternatives, alors que les realites locales presenteront une raison pour les decisions des differents concepts.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are increasingly deemed to be important given their potential control of water availability across seasons - from wet to dry seasons, especially given the concerns on the effect of climate change. In this paper, we focus on the collective action aspect of investing in irrigation reservoirs and on the potential scope for policy intervention. We formulate a model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir. We conceptualized the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in dry season, thus improving water safety for the whole society. We determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the potential policy measures to correct it, focusing on two different club access rules (open vs closed membership). Results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership, and minimum participation rules are required.

abstract = {The paper investigates how political processes shape the institutional arrangements and then affect performance of Indigenous irrigation systems. External interventions in the form of coercive authority and new rules resulted in a shift of resource governance from farmers to state officials in state-administered areas of Pakistani Punjab during British rule. The primary farm-level data were collected from 280 spate irrigation farmers from four systems. The analysis of systems-level agricultural production and institutional performance indicators of irrigation systems in identical environments is conducted. We examined Elinor Ostrom's Design Principles that characterise long-enduring, self-governing resource systems to compare robustness of tribal and state-administered area spate irrigation institutions. The state intervention in Indigenous irrigation systems weakened collective action and distorted equity in access to customary irrigation rights in state-administered areas. The study concludes that tribal areas systems working without state intervention have evolved effective local irrigation management institutions based on social and ecological values to ensure sustainable self-governing resource regimes.},

abstract = {Insufficient rainfall in the dry season and scarcity of surface water has resulted in firms' reliance on groundwater for agriculture in the northern part of Bangladesh. Most irrigation systems in the country are diesel or electric, which raises the cost and demand for energy and pollutes the environment. Utilizing the abundant sunshine and disseminating solar-based irrigation systems is expected to be a fittingly rewarding experience for irrigation purposes. Therefore, this study identifies the factors influencing the adoption of solar irrigation facilities (SIFs) and the impacts of their adoption on irrigation cost, return on investment (ROI), and production costs, using survey data collected from 405 rice farmers of Dinajpur district. The study employed three treatment effect estimators, namely inverse probability weighting (IPW), regression adjustment (RA), and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA), to address the potential selection bias issue. The results revealed that farming experience, knowledge, environmental awareness, soil fertility, and irrigation machinery ownership significantly influenced adoption decisions. The treatment effect model result indicated that farmers who adopted this method could minimize irrigation costs by 1.88 to 2.22{\%}, obtain 4.48 to 8.16{\%} higher ROI, and reduce total production cost by 0.06 to 0.98{\%} compared to non-adopters. Our findings suggested that policy interventions targeting scaling up SIFs should consider focusing on government and stakeholders' greater attention on designing more appropriate schemes through experimentation and multiple iterations.},

abstract = {The reuse of treated wastewater in countries such as Iran that suffers from drought is considered an important challenge in water management programs. The application of modern wastewater treatment systems particularly attached growth systems, owing to the short time required for start-up, low land requirements, and the absence of problems associated with sludge handling may be a resolution. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of the Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) in treating synthetic municipal wastewater and selecting an appropriate model. In this way, a bench-scale reactor possessing an effective volume of 15 liters, and synthetic wastewater with influent COD of 500 mg/l (similar to typical municipal wastewater) has been used and the experiments with media filling percentages of 30{\%}, 50{\%}, and 70{\%} and hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 4, 8, and 12 hours have been carried out. The observed data show that the optimum bulk density and hydraulic retention time are 50{\%} and 4 hours, respectively. Also, the kinetic study of reactor performance indicates that Grau second-order model has better conformation with Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor results. In addition, a regression model for predicting effluent COD based on the filling percentage and retention time is presented.},

abstract = {Location-specific fertilization rate recommendations are important for precision agriculture. This study aims to validate chili pepper fertilization recommendations in the field based on Ferads, a computer application program that is used to determine fertilizer recommendations for vegetable crops based on soil analysis. Two chili pepper varieties (Imola and Ori) were grown in Inceptisol soil with available content of 4.8 ppm P (very low), 44.2 ppm K (moderate), 1.53{\%} organic C, and pH 6.46. Experiments were conducted at Cikarawang Field Station, IPB (250 m asl), from July to December 2021, set up in RCBD with four replicates and five fertilization rates. Nutrigads automatic fertigation machine was used for delivering fertilization treatment. The Imola variety obtained a quadratic response on marketable and total fruit weight per ha, with the line of equation Y = -1460.1x2 +2316.3x+5951.3, R²=0.3168, and Y=-3025.6x2 + 4272.2x + 12032; R² = 0.4237, with the optimum rate of x = 0.7931, and x= 0.7060, respectively. The prediction for the Imola variety was higher than the on field conditions, hence the Ferads fertilization recommendations are to be multiplied by 70{\%}-79{\%} for optimal implementation on farmers' land. The Ferads rate had no effect on Ori variety, therefore, recommended rate is 100{\%}.},

abstract = {Two studies were conducted to determine fertilization and irrigation programs for turfgrass on home lawn. The objective of the first study was to determine the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer applications on Kentucky bluegrass sod planted on a high clay, low P subsoil representative of newly constructed residential developments. P rate treatments did not affect turfgrass color and quality from 2004 through 2006 even though the soil P test results would have recommended annual P applications of 98 kg P2O5 ha-1. For turfgrass established from sod grown on a soil with a sufficient soil P level, our research concludes that even when transplanting the sod to a low P soil, additional P applications are unnecessary. The objective of the second study was to determine the effect of three irrigation program and nutrient for two turfgrass species and a common lawn mixture. If water resource is limited, and turfgrass quality for low maintenance from July to September are not important, precipitation only treatment would be accepted under the weather condition of the research area. If maintaining turfgrass quality in summer months are important for the turfgrass manager, then either the every other day or the weekly irrigation treatment would be acceptable.},

abstract = {A three-year (2017–2019) irrigation research trial was conducted to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to a wide range of irrigation scenarios and assess the efficacy of Weathermatic Evapotranspiration-based (ET-based) smart controller for autonomous landscape irrigation management during dry seasons in inland southern California. The irrigation levels applied throughout the experiment ranged between 39{\%} and 103{\%} reference ET (ETo) and the irrigation frequency restrictions imposed were 3, 5 and 7 d/wk. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were continuously collected to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass [‘Tifgreen' Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt‐Davy] to irrigation treatments. Plots were also visually assessed and scaled from 1 (dead plot) to 9 (ideal turfgrass) following the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP) standards. Turfgrass water response function (TWRF) was introduced as a statistical regression model to estimate hybrid bermudagrass quality response (NDVI values) to irrigation levels over time. In the years 2018 (p {\textless} 0.01) and 2019 (p {\textless} 0.001), the irrigation levels showed a significant effect on NDVI values. The irrigation frequency restrictions showed no significant impact on NDVI in any of the years. We observed a high correlation (r = 0.84) between visual rating (VR) and NDVI data. The TWRF shows a high accuracy (RMSE = 0.047, no units), and estimated NDVI values were highly correlated (r = 0.89) with measured NDVI values. A comparison between the California irrigation management information system (CIMIS) reference evapotranspiration (ETo) versus temperature-based ETo estimations by the controller revealed the smart controller on average over-irrigated by 12{\%}, 2{\%} and 3{\%} throughout the experimental periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. A long term (34 years) analysis using CIMIS ETo data and TWRF model revealed 75{\%} ETo as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern California semiarid climate for months with high irrigation demand (i.e., May to November). The results also showed that hybrid bermudagrass could withstand more severe deficit irrigation treatments for shorter periods depending on ETo demand.},

abstract = {The paper examines the Bakolori Irrigation Project in Sokoto State, Nigeria and its impact on the intended beneficiaries of the project. The paper reviewed existing irrigation types in Nigeria and implications for sustainable food security in target communities. Also, it provides an insight into the catalogue of consequences that followed the project. Some of these include farmers' dispossessed of their productive farmlands, fraudulent reallocation processes, inadequate compensation and destruction of economic trees and crops as a result of the irrigation site. Evidences from the project shows that the project brought about certain positive developments in the lives of the target population. However, it was not devoid of undesirable challenges that require considerable attention in development project planning and implementation. These and many other issues surrounding the Bakolori irrigation project raises question on whether the project was a development or a catastrophe? Consequently, suggestions are made on how to design and implement development programmes with an overall view to improving the existing circumstances of the intended beneficiaries.

abstract = {Better irrigation practices, through increased water use efficiency, can
deliver economic, environmental and social benefits to agro-ecological
systems. Increasingly, farmers world-wide are turning to automated
irrigation systems to save them a significant amount of time by remotely
turning on and off pumps and valves. Unfortunately, automated irrigation
systems on their own do not provide insight on (i) the amount and timing
of irrigation required by the crop or, (ii) how irrigation schedules
should change with soil type, farm management and climate. To unravel
these complex interactions, an irrigation decision support tool is
needed. However, due to the high frequency of irrigations across dozens
of irrigation blocks, and the need to irrigate almost all year-round,
irrigation decision support tools can be very tedious and time-consuming
for farmers to use daily. For these reasons, many farmers will not adopt
these tools, and in doing so, fail to optimise irrigation use efficiency
due to the multi-factorial nature of the farming system. This paper
describes a cybernetic closed-loop solution that was piloted on a
sugarcane farm in north-eastern Australia. The solution seeks to improve
irrigation management by seamlessly integrating the WiSA automated
irrigation system with the IrrigWeb irrigation decision support tool.
Specifically, an Uplink program and a Downlink program were implemented
in the pilot study. The Uplink program saved the farmer a significant
amount of time. Instead of the farmer manually entering in records,
Uplink uploaded irrigation and rainfall data directly to the irrigation
decision support tool. The Downlink program calculated and applied
irrigation schedules automatically using IrrigWeb, but also incorporated
practical constraints, such as energy, pumping capability, irrigation
priorities and farmer irrigation preference. The simulation results
demonstrated that the developed closed-loop solution could effectively
manage irrigation scheduling by incorporating irrigation decision
support tools with practical constraints. Systems that increase water
use efficiency can deliver practical, profitable and environmental
benefits to irrigated agricultural systems worldwide.},

abstract = {The water use sector in South Africa is currently implementing the National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998), which requires, amongst other things, improved planning of expected water demands. A need was identified for the development of a computer model that can assist Water User Associations (WUAs) to easily and effectively capture data for management and planning purposes. The existing Water Administration System (WAS) computer program was used and a new module developed to capture data and perform calculations so that irrigation demand can be determined for different time periods (daily, seasonally, annually, etc.) and management levels (field, farm, and scheme). The crop yield (ton/ha) can also be captured at the end of a growing season and used to calculate the total yield (ton) and the yield per unit of water (g/m3). A summary of water demand for a specified period can easily be generated per crop type, and all the crop water demand information can easily be linked to a geographic information system (GIS). The module was implemented at the Orange-Riet WUA where it is used to model irrigation demand for 16700 ha of mixed crops irrigated from river and canal distribution systems.},

In this study, a graphical user interface for irrigation management has been developed with the support of a geographical information system (GIS) customization using Visual Basic for Application (VBA). Inverse distance weighted (IDW) method is employed to interpolate spatial inputs through an embedded environment provided by the GIS for customization with VBA technique. The developed Interface was used to analyze, simulate, handle, and integrate the irrigation management's spatial data. It can be used effectively from a farm-scale to a regional level and temporal data with interpolation techniques to generate thematic maps of rainfall, effective rainfall, reference evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using weather, crop, and soil data. The tool allows visualization of the spatial distribution of water requirements in the specified region and facilitates the localization of any discrepancies in water management, indicating whether interventions are required. Finally, interface was applied to estimate spatial irrigation water requirement to provide output, i.e., spatial maps of rainfall, effective rainfall, daily ETo, daily ETc, and net irrigation requirement (NIR). ETo was higher at Bhopal, Tikamgarh and Jhansi and lowered at Raisen and Sagar. The generated NIR map shows that the area nearby Khurai station has a higher irrigation requirement. On the other hand, the area covered by Begumganj, Sironj, Tikamgarh, and Banda has lower irrigation requirements. This information may help irrigation management's decision-making from a farm-scale to a regional level in the Betwa River Basin, India.},

abstract = {Waterlogging is one of the most important agricultural disasters affecting rice. In this study, we developed a waterlogging analysis system for paddy fields in irrigation districts with 7 modules, including pretreatment, hydrological computations and waterlogging computations. The newly developed system can consider the effects of both landform features and human interventions in irrigation districts. Observational data from the Gaoyou Irrigation District during 2014 and 2015 were applied to calibrate and validate a waterlogging analysis system, respectively. The results indicated that the waterlogging analysis system could accurately predict the water levels in both the calibration (R2 {\textgreater} 0.97) and validation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.92) periods. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the yield reduction rate indicated that saturated soil moisture and shape parameters ($\alpha$ and n) were the dominant soil hydrodynamic parameters affecting the simulated yield reduction rates. The weighted mean yield reduction rate of field areas decreased with increasing shape parameters and increased with increasing soil moisture saturation. However, further analysis showed that the maximum yield reduction rate exhibited a trend similar to that of saturated soil moisture, which indicated that the backwater effects of the river and ditch water level changes had a greater influence than the soil hydrodynamic parameters on the yield reduction rate, especially in low-elevation fields. In addition, the relationship between the yield reduction rate and field elevation could be fitted by an exponential function (R2 = 0.83), and the field pond depth decreased linearly with a reduction in field elevation in both 2014 (R2 = 0.36, p {\textless} 0.01) and 2015 (R2 = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.01). The proposed waterlogging analysis system could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of waterlogging on rice production in the studied irrigation district or in other regions with similar climatic conditions.},

In this work, a Programmable Logic Control, PLC, was used to develop an adaptive cablegation system capable of establishing the infiltration equation in real time and then adjusting the irrigation times to the infiltration rate and field geometry. A controlling program was developed for the on-field determination of the infiltration equation, simulation of advance in each furrow, and the optimization and management of the irrigation event. The equipment was tested in three experimental stations, including a Luvissol field organized in contour terraces with furrows of various lengths. The results demonstrate the capability of the system to adapt the application times to the different furrow lengths and the gradual decrease in the soil infiltration and to recommend an application depth that optimizes the Application Efficiency. Various improvements were made to this solar-powered cablegation, resulting in a reliable surface irrigation system capable of unsupervised operation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {In sprinkler irrigation the water distribution uniformity in field
conditions is not always a known factor, mainly due to the many
variables involved, especially the wind. The main objective of this
study was to design, install and test an automatic sprinkler bench to
measure the irrigation uniformity of solid set systems for multiple wind
conditions in real time. The system developed measures the different
wind speeds and directions while simultaneously recording the rainfall
distribution automatically. Consequently, the system requires little
manual intervention, thus reducing the operating costs. All the
information generated is stored in a database, obtaining multiple
results of irrigation uniformity for each stable wind regime. As a
second step, uniformities in different situations (layouts and wind
directions) were studied. In addition, this study shows the potential
for assessing the influence of different variables on irrigation
uniformity for several sets of sprinklers. As an example of possible
applications, 12,150 results of uniformity coefficients for conventional
impact rotary head sprinklers with hexagonal nozzles in windy conditions
were generated. These data were used to establish comparisons between
different sprinklers. To do this, a multiple linear regression
methodology was applied in order to analyse the influence of the
different contour variables on the irrigation uniformity. The test bench
presented along with the methodology to simulate and generate multiple
scenarios constitutes a powerful tool for designers, farmers and
technicians both for the improvement of existing installations and for
future designs. The generation of a large amount of irrigation
uniformity results for sprinkler irrigation in different wind conditions
will lead to a large database with the potential to be able to determine
the irrigation uniformity in all common scenarios.},

abstract = {In this study, we assessed the efficiency of a deficit irrigation program (DIP) on groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yield and economic profits. The DIP was designed to combine frequency and volume of irrigation to develop an appropriate irrigation water management (IWM) strategy for groundnut. Two field experiments were conducted at the Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, with a bunch variety of groundnut, VRI 2, under a randomized block design (RBD) with three replications. The treatments included DIP in combination with a foliar application of pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria (PPFM). The irrigation frequencies adopted for the first set of treatments were high frequency (5/5), medium frequency (7/5), and lower frequency (7/7) starting from 14 days after sowing (DAS). The effects of early water stress on groundnut pod yield and water use efficiency were investigated in a second experiment by starting irrigation at 21 DAS. The number of irrigation frequencies and irrigation volume was fixed to develop an easily readable irrigation chart for end-users. The number of irrigation frequencies was fixed as three, and the volume of irrigation was fixed as a depth of 3 cm. In the first experiment, a mini mobile pumping unit was used for scheduling irrigation frequencies; in the second experiment, the surface drip method was used. In both experiments, we also assessed the effects of foliar application of PPFM, widely used as a growth stimulant for several crops, especially under drought conditions. Overall, we observed that DIP led to up to 25.6{\%} water saving compared to surface irrigation. Use of the DIP at the medium frequency with PPFM spray had a significantly positive influence on water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) compared to conventional drip irrigation (CDI). Compared to surface irrigation (SI), DIP had a positive impact on growth parameters, yield attributes, and economic profitability with a higher benefit-cost ratio. Additionally, there were only minor differences between deficit irrigation (DI) results starting from 21 DAS and 14 DAS. Irrespective of the irrigation techniques, PPFM application had a positive effect on the yield attributes and WUE. Our results indicated that DI at a medium frequency (7/5) with PPFM spray, starting from 21 DAS under drip fertigation, is the best irrigation management innovation (IMI) strategy for optimum utilization of irrigation water without significant reduction in pod yield. This management had a positive influence on WUE and IWUE of summer groundnut in sandy clay loam soil. However, the exact scheduling of the irrigation may differ in different environments as well as soil types. Nevertheless, we propose that the application and further optimization of the DIP devised in this study would help the farmers attain a similar yield using a lower amount of irrigation water and lead to significant economic profits for the farmers.},

abstract = {Effective management of water resources and their efficient use in drought conditions are very important in the agricultural sector. Deficit irrigation is an optimal solution to produce crops under these conditions. It requires integrated, accurate and efficient management which is quite different from classic irrigation management. An irrigation manager must determine what rate of deficit irrigation is to be applied at each stage of growth; in the other words, deficit irrigation scheduling (DIS) should provide the water requirements of plants during the growing season based on water resources in a way which leads to maximum efficiency. In this study, a DIS heuristic algorithm called HADIS is developed, which is able to estimate the time, frequency and depth of irrigation events according to the crop water production function (CWPF) and FAO 56, leading to maximum yield and water productivity. HADIS is written using the C{\#} language in Visual Studio 2010. In addition, in order to optimize CWPF, GAMS 24.1 software along with Lindo Global Solver is used and SQL Server 2008 is employed as the database. The results of implementing different water, soil and crop scenarios proved the capability of HADIS to achievE maximum crop productivity.

abstract = {Level and graded-basins are widely used to irrigate citrus (Citrus sp.) and alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) crops grown on sandy soils of the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Draniange Districts (YMIDDs) of southwestern Arizona. Historically, irrigation application efficiencies in the YMIDDs have been low (generally {\textless}40{\%}). Owing to rising demands for water from urban and industrial interests and heightened water quality concerns, raising irrigation efficiencies have become a high priority in the Lower Colorado River Region. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a management package (management tools and guidelines) for increased irrigation performance of basins in the YMIDDs. The study consists of field experimentation, modeling (model calibration, model verification, and the development of management tools by simulation), and outreach-educational components. Results show higher application efficiencies (E a ) and distribution uniformities (DU) can be obtained in level and graded-basins through the proper selection of unit inlet flow rate (q o ) and cutoff length ( L co ) or cutoff time ( t co ). In addition, for the relatively small net irrigation requirements and long basisn of the YMIDDs, higher application efficiencies are obtained with level basins compared to graded-basins. Since implementation of the proposed management tools does not require reconfiguration of the physical infrastructure, it has the potential to be smoothly adopted by growers. Finally, some aspects of an on-going outreach program are highlighted.},

abstract = {This study aims to develop an economical tool for pipe size (diameter) design, i.e. a model, by using optimization techniques for agricultural irrigation systems. The developed model is validated through applications to an actual target region (Saemangeum reclamation area, zone 6). A newly developed metaheuristic optimization algorithm, termed a proportional genetic harmony search algorithm (PGHSA), is proposed in this study. To evaluate the optimization results of pipe diameters for the target region, the cost and hydraulic results of the initial and optimal designs are investigated by means of a comparison. Spatial equalization of nodal pressure and the economic velocity of each pipe are used as indicators for evaluating the hydraulic stability of the irrigation system. The results indicate that the proposed optimal design model can save construction cost considerably, by 1-11{\%}, in comparison to the original plans.Original Abstract: Resume La presente etude vise a developper un outil economique pour le dimensionnement (calcul du diametre) des tuyaux des systemes d'irrigation agricole, en utilisant des techniques d'optimisation.

abstract = {Chemical products, mainly chlorine, are often used to control or eradicate the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena Polymorpha, in pressurised irrigation pipes, although other disinfectants have been used, such as hydrogen peroxide. An optimum application of these substances is essential to achieve maximum effectiveness at minimum cost, without harmful effects on crops or the environment. This work defines tools and techniques for satisfactory process design, taking into account the specifics of operation and flow structure in irrigation system networks (very different from those of domestic water supply), the species to be combated and the high concentration of organic material in irrigation water. New specific functions have been implemented and applied in GESTAR 2010 (www.gestarcad.com), the software application for designing and managing pressurised irrigation networks, facilitating the use of the urban network water quality simulation module from the EPANET2 programme, adapting it for these purposes and obtaining predictions for the evolution of the concentration of the additive used over time at all points in the network, considering the reaction in the raw untreated water supply and the reaction with the wall, due to the effect of interaction with the invasive mollusc species (not necessarily zebra mussel).},

abstract = {Winter wheat production has been constrained by groundwater shortage in North China Plain. Adoption of a suitable saline water irrigation program and fertilizer management can save water and improve yield. A three-year field experiment was conducted in Bohai lowland plain to identify the effects of fertilizer application, saline water irrigation quantity and irrigation water salinity on wheat yield, water productivity and soil properties. Manure and chemical fertilizer were used as basal fertilizer. Saline water irrigation quantities were 80 mm (irrigation at jointing stage) and 160 mm (irrigation at jointing and grain-filling stages, 80 mm per irrigation). Irrigation water salinity levels were 2.0, 6.0 and 8.8 dS m⁻¹. Results showed that greater irrigation quantities improved grain yield by 15.1{\%} regardless of irrigation water salinity with chemical fertilizer in dry year, as shown by the increase in 1000-kernel weight. Manure increased grain yield compared with chemical fertilizer by 15.3{\%}, 37.5{\%} and 12.3{\%} in three seasons 2017–2020 mainly by increasing spike number, regardless of saline water irrigation quantity or irrigation water salinity. Increases in grain yield and aboveground biomass led to higher water productivity. Saline water irrigation threshold increased from 6.0 to 8.8 dS m⁻¹ with deficit irrigation and manure fertilizer due to the stable high yield. Irrigation water salinity of 6.0 and 8.8 dS m⁻¹ decreased organic matter (0–20 cm) by 19.4{\%} and 13.1{\%} compared with salinity of 2.0 dS m⁻¹. Manure increased soil organic matter (0–20 cm) by 20.5{\%} and soil water depletion (0–160 cm) by 68.6{\%} compared with chemical fertilizer, and reduced soil EC by 18.3{\%} and NO₃-N by 62.2{\%} at 0–160 cm soil depth. Heatmaps and entropy-TOPSIS analysis showed that the optimum field management for high-yield and water-saving was obtained with the combination of manure fertilizer and saline water irrigation quantity of 80 mm with salinity 8.8 dS m⁻¹.},

This paper analyses socio‐political issues and effects of environmental flows integration on water availability under the context of increased agricultural intensification in an effort to tackle food insecurity. Lack of appropriate framework comprising the procedural requirements and strategic directions as well as prevalence of politically motivated ad hoc development programmes are among major challenges identified. Introducing environmental flows to a perceived satisfactory level would result in a significant increase of unmet irrigation water demand, yet, “productivity first” norm overtakes. This is presumed to be due to skewed focus on irrigation expansion and low awareness on the possible consequences. The particular challenges highlighted generally unveil the inherent contradictions in the IWRM concept putting its claim that the set of principles and entire course stand universally accepted as a means to balance socio‐economic and environmental outcomes under question.},

abstract = {This paper is a part of the multi-country study carried out by the author at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with national partners in six Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) during 2001-2002. Based mainly on primary data collected from 5400 households in 26 irrigation systems, the study examines in detail the benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation. The results indicate that irrigation benefits vary widely across systems, and depend on a range of factors including local conditions, system management, irrigation policy, and broader economic and political factors. The study suggests that indirect irrigation benefits could be larger than direct benefits through the multiplier effect. The distribution of irrigation benefits also varies widely by type of the benefit and the socio-economic status of the beneficiaries. The direct benefits generally accrue to landholders while a significant part of the indirect benefits accrue to the landless and small farmers, positively contributing to their livelihoods. Further, the overall benefits of irrigation are large when irrigation- improving interventions, investments in infrastructure, improvements in system management and service delivery to farmers, are implemented in an integrated manner. On the other hand, the paper also suggests that irrigation can also lead to some negative or adverse social, health and environmental impacts. Such potential disbenefits of irrigation include displacement of people as a result of new irrigation development, public health risks from water-related diseases, irrigation-induced land and water degradation, loss of biodiversity and river health risks from increased river water withdrawals for irrigation. Often, negative social and environmental consequences adversely affect the poor more than the non-poor people. Most potential adverse impacts of irrigation are not due to irrigation water per se, but due to inadequacies and ineffectiveness of institutions and management to address them. Moreover, many of the potential adverse impacts can be avoided or minimized with effective planning, design and management of the projects. This paper develops and offers a generic typology of direct and indirect benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation that can be used to identify and influence different types of irrigation benefits and disbenefits for enhancing net benefits to the poor.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted during 2001 and 2002 at one location in North Carolina to compare development of early leaf spot (Cercospora arachidicola Hori), pod yield, and market grade characteristics when peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) was grown under overhead sprinkler irrigation (OSI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and fungicides were not applied or applied biweekly or based on weather advisories. Incidence of early leaf spot was lower when peanut was grown under SDI compared with OSI when fungicides were not applied. Fewer fungicide applications were needed when applications were based on weather advisories rather than when applied biweekly. There was no difference in early leaf spot control or leaf defoliation resulting from disease when fungicides were applied regardless of irrigation system or fungicide application approach. Pod yield was higher in 2001 under SDI compared with OSI when fungicides were not applied; yield was similar in 2002. Disease severity was much higher in 2001 than in 2002 and most likely explains differences in pod yield between years. No difference in yield was noted when fungicides were applied, regardless of irrigation system. The percentage of extra large kernels ({\%}ELK) was lower in 1 of 2 yr under SDI compared with OSI. There were no differences in percentages of fancy pods ({\%}FP), sound splits ({\%}SS), and other kernels ({\%}OK) among irrigation systems and fungicide programs. In a separate experiment where fungicides were applied biweekly, pod yield, {\%}FP, and {\%}ELK were similar under SDI and OSI but greater than nonirrigated peanut. The {\%}OK was lower when peanut was irrigated.},

abstract = {Category:  Other  Introduction/Purpose:  Orthopedic device-related infections can be difficult to treat and decrease the success of surgical interventions. The implant provides a surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation, which decreases antimicrobial efficacy. This study was conducted to assess the ability of the Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) Antimicrobial Irrigation System to disrupt biofilms from titanium coupons using an adapted ASTM E2871-19 method, 'Standard Test Method for Determining Disinfectant Efficacy Against Biofilm Grown in the CDC Biofilm Reactor Using the Single Tube Method.'  Methods:  CDC Biofilm Reactor was inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990TM), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300TM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442TM), or Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922TM). The reactors were run in a batch phase for 24 h, followed by continuous flow phase for an additional 24 h to produce single-species biofilms on titanium coupons. After coupons were washed with PBS to remove planktonic bacteria, growth control coupons were placed into standard sampling solution with 1{\%} Tamol (SST) (neutralizer) or treated with CHG Antimicrobial Irrigation System according to Instructions for Use (IFU) followed by a 60 sec dwell or no dwell. Coupons were rinsed with normal saline following treatment and placed in SST. Then coupons were sonicated and vortexed to release bacteria and plated for enumeration. A coupon from each group was fixed for SEM imaging.  Results:  The CHG Antimicrobial Irrigation System disrupted biofilms of all organisms from titanium coupons with the greatest log reduction per coupon in the 60 sec dwell treatment group (log10 reduction 2.02 to 4.56 CFU/coupon from controls) (Table). Overall, S. epidermidis and E. coli biofilms had the greatest reductions in bacterial densities. SEM images confirmed biofilm disruption from the titanium surface.  Conclusion:  his study determined that the CHG Antimicrobial Irrigation System disrupted biofilms from titanium coupons when used according to the instructions for use.},

abstract = {Surface water is used for irrigation of food plants all over the World. Such water can be of variable hygienic quality, and can be contaminated from many different sources. The association of contaminated irrigation water with contamination of fresh produce is well established, and many outbreaks of foodborne disease associated with fresh produce consumption have been reported. The objective of the present study was to summarize the data on fecal indicators and selected bacterial pathogens to assess the level of fecal contamination of a Norwegian river used for irrigation in an area which has a high production level of various types of food commodities. Sources for fecal pollution of the river were identified. Measures implemented to reduce discharges from the wastewater sector and agriculture, and potential measures identified for future implementation are presented and discussed in relation to potential benefits and costs. It is important that the users of the water, independent of intended use, are aware of the hygienic quality and the potential interventions that may be applied. Our results suggest that contamination of surface water is a complex web of many factors and that several measures and interventions on different levels are needed to achieve a sound river and safe irrigation.},

abstract = {Migration in ungulates is thought to have evolved as a strategy to increase seasonal access to high-quality forage and to decrease predation risk. Where migratory and nonmigratory ungulates coexist, migrants can outnumber nonmigrants by an order of magnitude. However, migratory ungulates are now in decline worldwide due to anthropogenic factors. Middlcton et al. (2013; hereafter referred to Middleton et al.) suggest that the productivity of migratory elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA, is declining because of increased predation pressure and a contraction of the growing season in their high-altitude summer range. As an alternative hypothesis, we propose that irrigation and predator control at low elevations have increased the benefits of a nonmigratory strategy. We show that while migratory elk calf: cow ratios decline in drought years, resident elk calf: cow ratios do not respond to drought. This is likely because resident elk increase forage utilization on irrigated landscapes during drought years. Low-altitude nonmigratory elk now outnumber the migratory segment of the population. We hypothesize that the resulting increase in competition for winter range is responsible for the decline in the productivity of the migratory elk herd. Our hypothesis is equally plausible to Middleton et al. 's and is supported by data. We suggest that this debate is best resolved using experimental or meta-analytical approaches where multiple hypotheses are tested against one another. Wildlife managers should consider the potential impacts on migratory elk of predator control and elk irrigation programs.},

abstract = {Smallholder irrigation schemes potentially improve the livelihoods of rural communities in developing countries. However, they face challenges such as infrastructural decline, lack of funding, lack of markets, shortage of water, underutilization of land, and inefficient irrigation systems. In Zimbabwe, the government carried out rehabilitation programs to address these problems but the performance of smallholder irrigation schemes remained poor. These chronic challenges triggered experts to adopt a market systems approach (MSA) to revitalize failing irrigation schemes. Using primary and secondary data sources collected in 2015, this study used a “before” and “after” descriptive assessment approach to determine the effectiveness of the MSA at revitalizing smallholder irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe. We used Mutema Irrigation Scheme as a case study. Results suggest that the MSA leads to improved efficiency of irrigation infrastructure, farm gross margins, willingness to pay irrigation fees and farmers' standard of living. While this research does not econometrically establish causation of relations between variables involved, our results provide a foundation for future research on the application of the MSA to revitalize underperforming smallholder irrigation schemes in developing countries.},

abstract = {The study examined the extent and nature of market oriented production in irrigated compared to rainfed systems in Ethiopia. By doing so the paper identifies the role of irrigation in market-oriented production, while at the same time highlighting the main constraints to market oriented development. Our results indicate that irrigation contributes significantly to increases in market participation, volume of marketed produce and, hence, income, by inducing shifts in farmers' cropping mix. The impact of commercialization of production on household food security is not direct and immediate mainly because of failures in the food market. While irrigation enhances market production, there are series of factors that pose serious constraints to market production. Land size, oxen holding, access to market and means of transport were found to be important determinants of market oriented production calling for policy interventions in land markets, access to productive assets and infrastructure development and policy measures to improve the performance of agricultural markets. The study also found education has market promoting effect in terms of increasing the probability of participation and volume of sale. Increased support to education can, thus, help in the long-term to transform traditional subsistence agriculture into more market-oriented agriculture. Finally there are unobserved site specific effects, related to location and other covariates, which influence market participation and volume decisions.},

abstract = {Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Ethiopian economy, as it is a key contributor to the country's GDP and food security. However, the sector is affected by climate change induced extreme weather events. The Ethiopian government has been making interventions through the development of irrigation schemes to augment otherwise low production and productivity. Koga irrigation development project (KIDP) is one of such initiatives developed to reduce food insecurity. However, due to political unrest, poor water management practice, limited market linkages and other institutional challenges, the project has not reached its desired goals. The purpose of this study is thus to evaluate the extent to which KIDP has impacted on household food security. Data were collected from 395 farm households and two FGDs drawn using random sampling technique. Multidimensional household food security index and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to measure food security and estimate the impact of irrigation on food security, respectively. The descriptive analysis shows that majorities of the sample households were mildly food insecure in the study area.

abstract = {Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Ethiopian economy, as it is a key contributor to the country's GDP and food security. However, the sector is affected by climate change induced extreme weather events. The Ethiopian government has been making interventions through the development ofirrigation schemes to augment otherwise lowproduction and productivity. Koga irrigation development project (KIDP) is one of such initiatives developed to reduce food insecurity. However, due to political unrest, poor watermanagement practice, limited market linkages and other institutional challenges, the project has not reached its desired goals. The purpose of this study is thus to evaluate the extent to which KIDP has impacted on household food security. Data were collected from 395 farm households and two FGDs drawn using random sampling technique. Multidimensional household food security index and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to measure food security and estimate the impact ofirrigation on food security, respectively. The descriptive analysis shows thatmajorities ofthe sample households were mildly food insecure in the study area. The PSM estimated that irrigation has positive and statistically significant impact on household annual income. However, the impact of irrigation on household food security found statistically insignificant. The FGD analysis confirmed that both groups of households had closely similar food security status. Accordingly, the study concluded that increasingly generated income in irrigation agriculture might not necessarily guarantee multidimensional household food security. Therefore, the growing interest of policymakers in promoting irrigation should integrally plan mechanisms of converting income into food security.},

abstract = {This paper addresses four key questions. What are the irrigation-poverty inequality linkages? Does access to irrigation water matter for rural poverty alleviation? Under what conditions does irrigation have the greatest impact on poverty? What are the pro-poor interventions that can enhance the antipoverty impact of irrigation? Findings from IWMI-led studies and other empirical studies show that: (1) irrigation enables households to improve crop productivity, grow high-valued crops, generate higher incomes and employment, earn a higher implicit wage rate for family labor and, more importantly, benefits the poor and landless through the enhanced availability of food, lower food prices, higher employment and income and other indirect effects; (2) access to irrigation water reduces the incidence and severity of poverty; (3) irrigation's impact on poverty is highest where landholdings are equitably distributed; (4) effective rural poverty alleviation requires that irrigation development be targeted to poor communities; and (5) unequal land distribution is associated with inequitable distribution of agricultural water benefits. We argue that the antipoverty impact of irrigation water can, therefore, be intensified through triggering a set of board and targeted interventions, simultaneously.},

@article{Anane2014b,
abstract = {In Tunisia, reclaimed water is increasingly used for irrigation in order to mitigate water shortage. However, few studies have addressed the effect of such practice on the environment. Thus, we attempted in this paper to assess the impact of irrigation with reclaimed water on the nitrate content and salinity in the Nabeul shallow aquifer on the basis of satellite images and data from 53 sampled wells. Ordinary and indicator kriging were used to map the spatial variability of these groundwater chemical parameters and to locate the areas where water is suitable for drinking and irrigation. The results of this study have shown that reclaimed water is not an influential factor on groundwater contamination by nitrate and salinity. Cropping density is the main factor contributing to nitrate groundwater pollution, whereas salinity pollution is affected by a conjunction of factors such as seawater interaction and lithology. The predictive maps show that nitrate content in the groundwater ranges from 9.2 to 206 mg/L while the electric conductivity ranges from 2.2 to 8.5 dS/m. The high-nitrate concentration areas underlie sites with high annual crop density, whereas salinity decreases gradually moving away from the coastline. The probability maps reveal that almost the entire study area is unsuitable for drinking with regard to nitrate and salinity levels. Appropriate measures, such as the elaboration of codes of good agricultural practices and action programs, should be undertaken in order to prevent and/or remediate the contamination of the Nabeul shallow aquifer.},

abstract = {In Niger, an important objective of the agricultural policy consists in promoting the development of small irrigation infrastructures in order to diversify agricultural production, extend the cropping season, raise land productivity and secure farmers' revenue. Small irrigation infrastructures are regarded as a possible alternative to large irrigation infrastructure since they are cheaper to implement and maintain and easier to manage. This paper attempts to explore the impacts of a program of small irrigation development in Niger on land allocation, agricultural production and income generation using the farm-level model FSSIM-Dev (Farm System Simulator for Developing Economies) and data from a nationally representative sample of farm households. FSSIM-Dev, a static positive programming model, was applied to every individual farm household included in sample to capture the full heterogeneity of impacts across farm households. Results show the large potential impact of small irrigation on agriculture production and income generation, especially during the dry season and in regions of Niger with high potential irrigable land. Farm income would increase by around 7 {\%} at country level if small irrigation was made available to all farmers. Small irrigation infrastructure would also contribute the reduction of income inequality.

abstract = {Drip irrigation is fundamental in water-saving agricultural greenhouses, especially in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) greenhouses. However, a long-term drip irrigation has been observed to be associated with soil degradation, concerning both soil aggregate structure and soil microbial community. To evaluate how drip irrigation scheduling influences the soil structure and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a long-term irrigation experiment was carried out in a tomato greenhouse in 2011, using an irrigation program with dripping water starting when the soil reached a suction of 20 kPa (D20), 30 kPa (D30) and 40 kPa (D40). In 2017, we tested the AMF community and soil aggregate composition by soil wet sieving. Aggregates of 0.25–1 mm represented the main class of aggregates (32.4{\%}–43.1{\%}) in this experiment. At D30, we measured the highest mean weight diameter (MWD) and soil organic carbon (SOC) and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels. Thus, D30 promoted soil aggregate stability in the greenhouse. According to the high-throughput sequencing results of AMF, Glomus at D30 was the main factor leading to a high soil aggregate stability, because its OTU relative abundance was significantly higher than those of Ambispora and Paraglomus. Through redundancy analysis, the GRSP concentration was positively correlated with the SOC and total N (TN) levels and with the presence of the genera Ambispora, Glomus and Paraglomus. This evidenced that AMF and SOC helped to increase GRSP concentration and aggregate stability. Therefore, initiating irrigation when the soil reaches a water suction of 30 kPa could promote soil aggregate stability by favoring AMF abundance.},

@phdthesis{Pitts2015,
abstract = {The three chapters of this dissertation investigate two policy issues faced by water utilities:  infrastructure investment and water budget programs.  Water utilities have infrastructure that is deteriorating at an increasing rate, necessitating higher rates of investment from ratepayers.  At the same time utilities must improve their management of existing water supplies in order to postpone the need to procure water supplies with a higher marginal cost.  Water budgets are a way to manage scarce water resources more efficiently.       The first chapter focuses on customer preferences for infrastructure investments.  Individuals are willing-to-pay to have fewer outages at home, shorter average outage lengths, greater advance notification, more urban greenspace irrigated with reuse water, and greater use of renewable energy.  The correlated attributes model indicates evidence of adaptive behavior towards longer outages and that individuals who prefer high levels of reuse infrastructure investment also prefer high levels of investment in renewable energy.  These results are useful to policymakers who need to raise rates to fund the infrastructure investment gap.     The second chapter studies the impact of model assumptions about the marginal utility of income (MUI) by comparing MWTP distributions from preference-space and WTP-space mixed logit models.  In preference-space models, the MUI, whether heterogeneous or fixed, is the denominator of the MWTP ratio.  WTP-space models estimate the MUI separately from the attribute coefficients that represent the MWTP.  The resulting MWTP distribution using WTP-space estimates has a tighter distribution and no extreme outliers.  From a behavioral standpoint, the distribution closely resembles a preference-space fixed cost model.    The third chapter examines the water budget program for irrigation-only customers.  Water budgets are a new conservation tool that combine aspects of quantity restrictions with increasing price blocks to encourage efficient water consumption.  Excess consumption receives a per-unit surcharge.  Private and public sector accounts have significantly different consumption behavior.  Price elasticity of demand is estimated as {\$}-0.845{\$}.  Accounts in the 85th and 95th percentiles of water budget use, parks, and multi-family accounts are among the most inelastic.  Commercial and home owner associations are the most price responsive.  Policy recommendations include focusing on accounts in the middle use tier between 100 and 150$\backslash${\%} of water budget use and raising the highest surcharge rate.     These papers contribute to the literature by examining new infrastructure investments to increase the use of reuse water irrigating greenspace and renewable energy use.  The studies also examine the differences between correlated and uncorrelated attributes models.  The final paper contributes by focusing on non-residential water consumption and estimates elasticity of demand for a customer class that only has outdoor water use.},

abstract = {This article examines the economics of groundwater irrigation and shallow tubewell (STW) ownership decision making, using farm-level data collected from 324 households in Nepal. STW irrigation generated a significant positive effect on rice yield and farmers' incomes. Based on a probit model, the farm size, land fragmentation, access to electricity, and access to credit were found to significantly influence farmers' decisions to own STWs. Although the water market benefited poor farmers, it is too small and monopolistic. Policy reforms needed to make groundwater accessible to the poor majority include effective credit programs, investments in rural electrification, and public sector support for promoting suitable pumping technologies},

abstract = {OBJECTIVEAcute traumatic wounds are contaminated with bacteria and therefore an infection risk. Antiseptic wound irrigation before surgical intervention is routinely performed for contaminated wounds. However, a broad variety of different irrigation solutions are in use. The aim of this retrospective, non-randomised, controlled longitudinal cohort study was to assess the preventive effect of four different irrigation solutions before surgical treatment, on wound infection in traumatic soft tissue wounds.METHODOver a period of three decades, the prophylactic application of wound irrigation was studied in patients with contaminated traumatic wounds requiring surgical treatment, with or without primary wound closure. The main outcome measure was development of wound infection. From 1974-1983, either 0.04 {\%} polihexanide (PHMB), 1 {\%} povidone-iodine (PVP-I), 4 {\%} hydrogen peroxide, or undiluted Ringer's solution were concurrently in use. From 1984-1996, only 0.04 {\%} PHMB or 1 {\%} PVP-I were applied. From 1997, 0.04 {\%} PHMB was used until the end of the study period in 2005.RESULTSThe combined rate for superficial and deep wound infection was 1.7 {\%} in the 0.04 {\%} PHMB group (n=3264), 4.8 {\%} in the 1 {\%} PVP-I group (n=2552), 5.9 {\%} in the Ringer's group (n=645), and 11.7 {\%} in the 4 {\%} hydrogen peroxide group (n=643). Compared with all other treatment arms, PHMB showed the highest efficacy in preventing infection in traumatic soft tissue wounds (p{\textless}0.001). However, compared with PVP-I, the difference was only significant for superficial infections.CONCLUSIONThe large patient numbers in this study demonstrated a robust superiority of 0.04 {\%} PHMB to prevent infection in traumatic soft tissue wounds. These retrospective results may further provide important information as the basis for power calculations for the urgently needed prospective clinical trials in the evolving field of wound antisepsis.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of topical irrigation with a solution of ozone (O3) water on soft tissue healing after dental implantation. Recruited patients underwent similar oral surgeries (dental implantation) on both sides of their upper jaws. One randomly selected site was irrigated with 10 ml of O3 water solution immediately following surgery and after 3 days. The other side was irrigated with normal saline. Wound healing was assessed 24 hours and 5 days following the surgery. Early healing scores (EHSs) were registered. Post-operative instructions were provided to all patients. Of them, 12 were male and 16 were female. Tissues at the sites of surgery were thin in 13 patients and thick in 15 patients. The proportions of sites irrigated with ozonated water that had merged incision margins, no fibrin at the incision margins, and no signs of inflammation were higher than those of sites irrigated with saline on days 1 and 5 following the surgery. On day 1, the median total EHSs for re-epithelization, hemostasis, and inflammation were significantly higher for intervention sites than those for control sites. However, no significant differences were observed in the studied parameters between the intervention and control sites on day 5. O3 treatment enhances soft tissue healing in the immediate postoperative period. The assessment of long-term clinical outcomes of O3 treatment should be investigated further.},

abstract = {Importance Recent studies suggest that budesonide added to saline nasal lavage can be an effective treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Objective To evaluate the incremental effect of adding budesonide to large-volume, low-pressure saline sinus irrigation. Design, Setting, and Participants This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at a quaternary care academic medical center between January 1, 2016, and February 16, 2017. A total of 80 adult patients with CRS were enrolled; 74 completed baseline assessments; and 61 remained in the trial to complete all analyses. Data analysis was conducted from March 2017 to August 2017. Interventions All study participants were provided with a sinus rinse kit including saline and identical-appearing capsules that contained either budesonide (treatment group) or lactose (control group). Patients were instructed to dissolve the capsules in the saline and use the resulting solution to irrigate both nasal cavities, using half the solution for each cavity, once daily for 30 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was the change in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores, pretreatment to posttreatment, in the budesonide group compared with the control group. Secondary outcome measures included patient-reported response to treatment, as measured with a modification of the Clinical Global Impressions scale, and endoscopic examination scored by the Lund-Kennedy grading system. Results Of the 74 participants who completed baseline assessments (37 in each study arm), mean (SD) age, 51 (14.7) years, 50 (68{\%}) were women. Of the 61 who remained in the trial to complete all analyses, 29 were randomized to budesonide treatment, and 32 to saline alone. The average change in SNOT-22 scores was 20.7 points for those in the budesonide group and 13.6 points for those in the control group, for a mean difference of 7 points in favor of the budesonide group (95{\%} CI, −2 to 16). A total of 23 participants (79{\%}) in the budesonide group experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in their SNOT-22 scores compared with 19 (59{\%}) in the control group, for a difference of 20{\%} (95{\%} CI, −2.5{\%} to 42.5{\%}). The average change in endoscopic scores was 3.4 points for the budesonide group and 2.7 points for the control group. There were no related adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance This study shows that budesonide in saline nasal lavage results in clinically meaningful benefits beyond the benefits of saline alone for patients with CRS. Given the imprecision in the treatment effect, further research is warranted to define the true effect of budesonide in saline nasal lavage.},

@article{CARLI201490,
abstract = {In the lowlands of Central Asia, summer grown potato is increasingly affected by soil moisture deficit due to inadequate irrigation and high evaporative demand. Many farmers cannot apply irrigation schedules that fully respond to the water demand because of reduced water availability throughout the Aral Sea basin, caused by global warming, and the competing use of irrigation by the cotton crop. The effects of different irrigation regimes were evaluated on ten potato clones in the lowlands of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, during the summer cropping season (July–October) of three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010). The applicability of a growth model to predict yield under the different water regimes was tested. Significant treatment and genotype effects on yield and yield components were observed. The significant correlation for tuber yield among treatments suggested that yield under water limitation was driven more by potential yield than water restriction tolerance. Tuber yield was more associated to tuber weight than to tuber number, a component already largely determined when the different water treatments were initiated. The reduction of water supply after tuberization had a limited effect on yield and consequently drastically enhanced water use efficiency. It increased starch and dry matter content, but decreased vitamin C content. Some clones maintained high yield across years and treatments and appeared as good candidates for being recommended to farmers. Others showed interesting quality traits and are proposed for use as progenitors in breeding programs targeting at the improvement of the nutritional value of potato. A good prediction of yield was obtained using the growth model except for year 2009 when trials were heavily affected by weed infestation. The present study contributes to the improvement of water management and the identification of clones with high tuber yield and quality for the lowlands of Tashkent. Additional experiments are required to address the constraints to potato cultivation in other agro-climatic zones of Central Asia.},

abstract = {Water research studies in Saudi Arabia clearly showed sever depletion of groundwater. Therefore, the scientifically applied research program related to water saving and conservation in agriculture is essential, where agricultural activities account for more than 85{\%} of the total water consumed. This study aims to investigate the effect of four irrigation levels, two irrigation methods and three clay deposits on water-use efficiency (WUE) of squash and the distributions of salts and roots in sandy calcareous soils. A field experiment was conducted at the college experimental station in 2002 and 2003. It consists of three clay deposits, three rates (CO=0, C2=1.0 and C3=2.0{\%}), four irrigation levels (T1=60, T2=80, T3=100 and T4=120{\%} of Eto) using surface (IM1) and subsurface (IM2) drip irrigation. Results indicated that squash fruit yield was significantly increased with the increase in irrigation water level for each season. Generally, WUE values were increased as linearly with applied irrigation water and decreased at the highest irrigation level. Types of clay deposits significantly affected fruit yields compared with the control. The yield increase was 12.8, 8.35 and 6.4{\%} for Khulays, Dhruma and Rawdat clay deposits, respectively. The differences between surface and subsurface drip on fruit yields and WUE were also significant. Results indicated that moisture content of subsurface-treated layer increased dramatically, while salts were accumulated at the surface and away from the emitters in subsurface drip irrigation. Intensive root proliferation is observed in the clay-amended subsurface layer compared with non-amended soil. The advantages of subsurface drip irrigation were related to the relative decrease in salt accumulation in the root zone area where the plant roots were active and water content was relatively higher.},

First root canal samples were collected before treatment (S1). After chemo-mechanical preparation, final irrigation was performed with the selected irrigant (NaOCl 2{\textordmasculine}C, NaOCl 25{\textordmasculine}C and NaOCl 45{\textordmasculine}C) and second samples were collected (S2). Samples were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the levels of total bacteria. The root canal treatments were completed and the participants were given instructions to record postoperative pain levels at 24, 48 and 72 hours, 5 days and 1 week after treatment using a visual analog scale (VAS).RESULTSThe reduction in the number of total bacterial cell equivalents from S1 to S2 was statistically significant in all groups (p{\textless}0.001). The NaOCl 2˚C group reported significantly less postoperative pain than the NaOCl 45˚C group (p{\textless}0.05). Postoperative analgesic intake was significantly higher in the NaOCl 45˚C group than in the NaOCl 2˚C group (p{\textless}0.05).CONCLUSIONWe conclude that final irrigation with NaOCl at different temperatures results in similar antibacterial effectiveness. Final irrigation with cold NaOCl (2˚C) is better than NaOCl 45˚C when comparing postoperative pain levels.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe current experiment was done during the 2018 and 2019 seasons on ‘Ewais' mango trees (Mangifera indica) grown in Research Station, El-Nubaria district, Egypt, to study the impact of spraying ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and irrigation time on vegetative growth, yield and fruit quality. All experimental plants have been received the same care, i.e. control of pests {\&} weeds, fertilization, and irrigation until the 1st week of October. The irrigation was adapted to apply 5m3/feddan (4200 m2)/week to control leaves damage due to low temperature after this period and the treatments included: (T1) Water spraying at 1st week of November + start normal irrigation program at the same time after four weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan (4200 m2)/week (Control). (T2) Spraying with NH4NO3 2{\%} at 1st week of November + start normal irrigation program at the same time after four weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan /week. (T3) Spraying NH4NO3 2{\%} at 1st week of November + start normal irrigation program at 1st week of December after eight weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan/week. (T4) Spraying NH4NO3 2{\%} at 1st week of November + start normal irrigation program at 1st week of January after twelve weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan/week. All treatments received the same quantity of irrigation water, approximately 4000 m3/feddan/year.ResultsAll treatments (T2, T3 {\&} T4) had a significant influence on vegetative growth, fruiting behavior (fruit set {\%} {\&} the yield), and the fruit quality compared with the control (T1). The significant was not only the fruit physical characteristics (weight, dimensions, volume, and specific gravity) but also the fruit chemical characteristics (total soluble solids {\%} (T.S.S.), acidity {\%}, T.S.S / acid ratio and vitamin C (L- ascorbic acid)).ConclusionSpraying NH4NO3 2{\%} at 1st week of November plus start normal irrigation program at 1st week of November or December or January after 4 or 8 or 12 weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan (4200 m2)/week (T2, T3, and T4) increased the vegetative growth, i.e. length of terminal shoots, No. leaves / terminal shoots {\&} leaf area as well as the fruiting behavior such as fruit set percentage, No. fruits per tree {\&} the tree production (kg/tree) and improved the fruit characteristics not only the fruit physical parameters but also the chemical properties in comparing with the untreated trees. During the two seasons, spraying NH4NO3 2{\%} at 1st week of November plus start normal irrigation program at 1st week of January after 12 weeks of adapted irrigation as 5m3/feddan/week (T4) is recommended since; it is the only treatment with the superiority effect on studied parameters.},

@article{Mwangi2020,
abstract = {While high urban vegetable demand has driven unprecedented intensification of small private irrigation in peri-urban Kenya, absence of appropriate local governance mechanisms has necessitated interventions by concerned state agencies. Based on Ostrom's design principles for sustainable commons, this paper evaluates the robustness of the irrigation management regime emanating from involuntary self-governance among peri-urban farmers. Findings show that since conflicts were fueled by water scarcity peaks corresponding with market price peaks, the interventions overemphasized facilitating water sharing among users. With conflicting users viewed as the problem by the agency, their experiences with the resource system, existing social structures, and resource use dynamics causing conflicts were largely ignored in the change process. Consequently, narrowly focused use rules that failed to properly define important resource parameters resulted. Further, user drawing rights have no significant input requirement, monitoring of water resource condition and sanctioning of deviant behavior are overlooked due to a lack of sufficient social capital and commitment to the collective establishment. Although inherent conflicts signify high economic valuation of water access by users, the lack of local ownership of the transition process made the policy interventions fail to produce rules that can guarantee sustainable irrigation development in an environment characterized by intensive irrigation and agrochemicals application, and growing domestic and industrial water demand. Therefore, recognizing water as a commercial input, recognizing conflicting users and their experiences as an essential solution, and integrating them in a participatory manner in subsequent institutional change is deemed necessary for effective governance in the post-conflict setup.},

abstract = {In Belgium the necessity of an irrigation system for pear trees under the temperate zone climatological conditions is often discussed, especially for pear orchards on loamy soils. With an annual rainfall of about 760 mm per year, it is not always evident to judge about the investment in an irrigation system in a pear orchard. But with the expected global changes in climate in the near future, more extreme situations of drought with more irregular rainfall periods during the summer are expected. Therefore an increased interest in irrigation systems under pear trees is expected. Another important factor for the pear cultivar 'Conference' is the price difference between a fruit of 55 mm and 65 mm where the larger fruit can bring double the price. Also some cultural interventions in the orchards like root pruning for vegetative growth control can increase the drought susceptibility of pear trees. The effects of root pruning on the mineral composition of leaves and fruit and on the fruit quality at harvest and during storage will be discussed. In these trials, soil water content was measured with gravimetric moisture measurements and compared with watermark measurements at different depths in the soil profile. Supplementary applications of potassium and nitrogen were given through the irrigation system during summer with the aim of improving the final fruit quality of the pears. The effect of this supplementary fertigation with nitrogen on fruit quality was more prominent than the effect of a supplementary potassium application.},

abstract = {CORE IDEAS: Arsenic content in rice was reduced by not flooding fields. Silicon fertilizer did not affect arsenic content in rice. Cultivar and hybrid selection did not affect rice arsenic content. Field tests were conducted at three locations for 2 yr with rice grown with different irrigation systems and rates of calcium silicate fertilizer to determine the effects on brown rice arsenic (As) levels and rice yields. Irrigation systems were sprinkler irrigated using a center‐pivot system, intermittent flooding, and continuous flooding beginning at the first‐tiller rice growth stage. Pelletized calcium silicate fertilizer, a byproduct from steel mills, was applied at 0, 121, and 242 kg Si ha⁻¹ in subplots to bare soil and incorporated. After harvest, rice was de‐hulled to make brown rice grain and tested for total As content. Silicon (Si) fertilizer and cultivar/hybrid selection did not impact rice grain As levels in any of the irrigation programs. Weed control was more difficult to maintain without flooding, which reduced yields. Rice yields grown in aerobic soil conditions with sprinkler irrigation were increased significantly with 60 kg Si ha⁻¹. The high to low order of total As content in rice grain from plots was continuous‐flood {\textgreater} intermittent flood {\textgreater} sprinkler irrigated. The test site with sprinkler irrigation was on a different soil than intermittent and continuous flood systems. Flooded rice on Overcup silt loam soil averaged 210 µg As kg⁻¹ total As. On Sharkey clay soil, rice with intermittent‐flood irrigation contained 27 µg As kg⁻¹ total As in grain compared with 77 µg As kg⁻¹ in continuous flood, but yield was not significantly different from continuous‐flooded rice. Sprinkler‐irrigated rice on Tiptonville silt loam soil averaged 13 µg As kg⁻¹.},

abstract = {Importance The effect of a physical property of irrigation fluid (at body vs room temperature) on recurrence rate in the evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) needs further study. Objective To explore whether irrigation fluid temperature has an influence on cSDH recurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a multicenter randomized clinical trial performed between March 16, 2016, and May 30, 2020. The follow-up period was 6 months. The study was conducted at 3 neurosurgical departments in Sweden. All patients older than 18 years undergoing cSDH evacuation during the study period were screened for eligibility in the study. Interventions The study participants were randomly assigned by 1:1 block randomization to the cSDH evacuation procedure with irrigation fluid at room temperature (RT group) or at body temperature (BT group). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was recurrence requiring reoperation within 6 months. Secondary end points were mortality, health-related quality of life, and complication frequency. Results At 6 months after surgery, 541 patients (mean [SD] age, 75.8 [9.8] years; 395 men [73{\%}]) had a complete follow-up according to protocol. There were 39 of 277 recurrences (14{\%}) requiring reoperation in the RT group, compared with 16 of 264 recurrences (6{\%}) in the BT group (odds ratio, 2.56; 95{\%} CI, 1.38-4.66; P {\textless} .001). There were no significant differences in mortality, health-related quality of life, or complication frequency. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, irrigation at body temperature was superior to irrigation at room temperature in terms of fewer recurrences. This is a simple, safe, and readily available technique to optimize outcome in patients with cSDH. When irrigation is used in cSDH surgery, irrigation fluid at body temperature should be considered standard of care.},

Under drought conditions, to which they are normally subjected under semiarid conditions, their numbers rapidly decline.

abstract = {In Jordan, water rather than land is the determining factor for increasing the size and the productivity of the irrigated areas. Traditional surface irrigation is the general practice and the farmers themselves have been managing their water in terms of distribution and scheduling. The major developments in irrigation started in the 1950s, aiming at integrated rural development of the Jordan Valley, which would utilize Jordan's share of the water resources of the Jordan River System. Currently, irrigation is practiced in two main areas: the Jordan rift valley (JRV) and the Upland. The soil characteristics are subject to continuous changes based on a number of environmental factors. Many types of soil play a large part in classifying the plants into environmental groups. The macronutrients (N, P, K) and some of the heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) have been investigated in soil profiles irrigated by different water qualities. Two agricultural areas were selected for this purpose; one irrigated with fresh water from the Yarmouk River and the other irrigated with treated wastewater from King Talal Dam. In all farms, three trenches (inlet, middle and outlet of the row) were dug in the irrigated area, while in the non-irrigated area one trench was dug as a control. Each trench was 60cm wide and 60cm deep. Nine samples from each trench were collected at 20cm intervals horizontally and vertically, making a total of 486 samples from all farms and control points. The results showed that the concentrations of the heavy metals in the soils from the selected farms lie within the accepted values. The results indicate that there are no adverse impacts of irrigation water for agricultural practices. It was also found that there was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen, potassium and phosphate in most of the selected farms, which reflects the extensive use of fertilizers. An awareness program is highly recommended in order to draw the attention of farmers to this serious problem.},

abstract = {There are large areas of moderately Cd-contaminated rice paddies (Cd content was less than risk intervention value) in southwest China, under natural conditions, the effect of irrigation water system's distribution on the Cd contamination in soil and rice is still less accurate. In this study, a survey of paired soil-rice (n = 1520) samples was conducted in a large paddy of about 7000 ha in southwest China that originated from the same parent material and grew with the same rice varieties. Specially, three representative characteristic regions (area A, B, C) were selected from north to south to thoroughly investigate the reasons for pollution characteristics. Background soil, irrigation water and sediment, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer were sampled to study the causes of pollution. Results showed the biological accumulation factor (BAF = C (rice Cd)/C (soil Cd)) of area C in the south reached 1.34, which was about 8 times higher than that of area A in the north. The uneven distribution of irrigation water due to geographical reasons was the most important factor leading to this pollution characteristics. The Cd content in soil of north was much higher than that in the south due to the history of Cd-contaminated irrigation and background content of Cd. During farmland formation, river impinges resulted in a gradual decrease in both Cd content and pH in the background soil from north to south. Both of historical polluters and major irrigation systems were distributed in area A. However, when sewage irrigation stopped about 30 years ago, long-term weakly alkaline irrigation increased the pH of the soil from acidic to neutral in area A. Meanwhile, flooding irrigation in area A reduced the absorption of Cd by roots compared area C where was rarely flooded during the rice planting process due to the lack of irrigation water.},

abstract = {In recent years, climate change has greatly affected rainfall and air temperature levels leading to a reduction in water resources in Southern Europe. This fact has emphasized the need to focus on the use of non-conventional water resources for agricultural irrigation. The reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) can represent a sustainable solution, reducing the consumption of freshwater (FW) and the need for mineral fertilisers. The main aim of this study was to assess, in a three-year period, the effects of TWW irrigation compared to FW on the biomass production of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] plants and soil characteristics and to estimate the nutritional input provided by TWW irrigation. TWW was obtained by a constructed wetland system (CWs) which was used to treat urban wastewater. The system had a total surface area of 100 m2. An experimental field of bermudagrass was set up close to the system in a Sicilian location (Italy), using a split-plot design for a two-factor experiment with three replications. Results highlighted a high organic pollutant removal [five days biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): 61{\%}, chemical oxygen demand (COD): 65{\%}] and a good efficiency in nutrients [total nitrogen (TN): 50{\%}, total phosphorus (TP): 42{\%}] of the CWs. Plants irrigated with TWW showed higher dry aboveground dry-weight (1259.3 kg ha-1) than those irrigated with FW (942.2 kg ha-1), on average. TWW irrigation approximately allowed a saving of 50.0 kg TN ha-1 year-1, 24.0 kg TP ha-1 year-1 and 29.0 kg K ha-1 year-1 on average with respect to commonly used N-P-K fertilisation programme for bermudagrass in the Mediterranean region. Soil salinity increased significantly (p ≤ 0.01) over the years and was detected to be higher in TWW-irrigated plots (+6.34{\%}) in comparison with FW-irrigated plots. Our findings demonstrate that medium-term TWW irrigation increases the biomass production of bermudagrass turf and contributes to save significant amounts of nutrients, providing a series of agronomic and environmental benefits.},

'Mountain Spring' were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. Under greenhouse conditions, inoculation of seedlings with Bacillus strains GBO3+IN937 resulted in a significant increase in plant height and fresh and dry weight. Rhizosphere Bacillus spp. population densities ranged from 4.6-5.9 log cfu plant super(-1). Under field conditions, plant height was significantly affected by both mulch and Bacillus spp. Plant residue mulch decreased plant height the first year under dry growing conditions and increased plant height the second year under wet conditions. Plants inoculated with MBI600 were taller than the non-inoculated control plants both years, while GBO3+IN937-inoculated plants were taller than the control in the first year only. In both years, neither irrigation nor fungicide affected plant height. Plant residue mulch and fungicides decreased the severity of foliar diseases (early blight, septoria leaf spot and bacterial spot). No differences in disease severity were found among Bacillus spp. treated plants in the first year. During the second season GBO3+IN937-inoculated plants showed the highest level of disease severity.},

abstract = {In the era of climate change, decreased precipitation and increased evapo-transpiration hampers the yield of several cereal crops along with the soil salinity and poor ground water resource. Wheat being the moderately tolerant crop face many challenges in the arid and semi-arid regions under irrigated agriculture. In view of this, the study was planned to explore the potential of durum wheat genotypes under salinity on the basis of physiological traits. Experiment was designed as RBD in three replications to evaluate 15 wheat genotypes with moderate saline irrigation (ECiw – 6 dS m−1) and extreme saline irrigation (ECiw – 10 dS m−1) along with one set of control (Best available water). Different physiological traits such as water potential ($\psi$p), osmotic potential ($\psi$s), relative water content (RWC), Na+ and K+ content were recorded in roots as well as shoots at the reproductive stage whereas photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were measured in the flag leaves. A significant variability (p {\textless} 0.001) was noted among the genotypes under different stress environments and it was observed that durum genotype HI 8728 and HI 8737 showed less reduction in plant water traits (RWC, $\psi$p and $\psi$s) than the salinity tolerant checks of bread wheat KRL 99 and KRL 3–4. HD 4728 and HI 8708 maintained higher photosynthetic rate as well as higher chlorophyll content under the extreme salinity level of ECiw – 10 dSm−1. No significant differences were found in root Na+ in genotypes KRL 99 (3.17g), KRL 3–4 (3.34g) and HI 8737 (3.41g) while in shoots, lowest accumulation was seen in KRL 99, MACS 3949 and KRL 3–4 at ECiw – 10 dSm−1. The mean range of K+ content was 7.60–9.74{\%} in roots and 4.21–6.61{\%} in shoots under control environment which decreased to 50.77{\%} in roots and 46.05{\%} in shoots under extreme salinity condition of ECiw – 10 dSm−1. At ECiw – 10 dSm−1, KRL 99 maintained highest K+/Na+ in both root and shoot followed by KRL 3–4, HI 8737, MACS 3949, HD 4728 in roots and MACS 3949, KRL 3–4, MACS 4020, HD 4758, MACS 3972 and HI 8713 in shoots. The differential response of durum wheat genotypes under salinity particularly for physiological traits, confer their adaptability towards stress environments and exhibit their potential as genetic sources in breeding programs for improving salt stress tolerance.},

abstract = {Objectives              Ventriculitis is an uncommon condition with a poor prognosis, especially when complicated by brain abscess. We compared the therapeutic efficacy of neuroendoscopic ventricular irrigation with those of conventional treatments such as ventricular drainage and continuous irrigation via a ventricular drain.              Patients and methods              We retrospectively analyzed 14 consecutive patients treated for ventriculitis at our institution between 2001 and 2015. Included were the six patients treated with neuroendoscopic (NE) irrigation (NE group), which we adopted in 2011, and the eight patients treated before 2011 with conventional treatments (non-NE group). We compared mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 6 months postoperatively, and duration of ventricular/spinal drainage-catheter placement between groups.              Results              Mean age at onset was 49.3 years (range, 32-68 years) in the NE group and 50.3 years (range, 8-78 years) in the non-NE group. At 6-month follow-up, good clinical outcome (mRS{\textless}=3) was observed in 66.7{\%} of the NE group, whereas it was observed in 25.0{\%} of the non-NE group. There were three deaths (37.5{\%}) in the non-NE group but none in the NE group. Duration of drainage-catheter placement was significantly shorter in the NE group than in the non-NE group (19.8days vs. 70.9days,p{\textless}0.001). Among patients in the NE group, only those who underwent irrigation on the day of diagnosis maintained a low mRS score.              Conclusion              Neuroendoscopic ventricular irrigation was safe and effective in the treatment of ventriculitis. Immediate intervention after diagnosis may lead to an improved prognosis.},

abstract = {Background: Establishing good hygiene habits are valuable for present and future oral health. Below 6 years, tooth brushing should be performed by parents, as increasing dexterity and cognition may permit supervised brushing until the child is capable of independent brushing. Aim and Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of modified oral irrigation device in children in terms of plaque control and to compare the effectiveness of plaque control with manual brushing with the modified oral irrigation device in children. Materials and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed on 12 subjects who were allocated to the two study groups. After obtaining the consent, the control group was instructed tooth brushing with regular pediatric commercially available toothbrush and the intervention group with modified oral irrigation device. Plaque scores in both groups were assessed pre- and post-brushing using modified navy plaque index. Results: The data were subjected to Descriptive statistics and Paired t-test using SPSS version 22. Intragroup comparison of mean difference of plaque score in control group and intervention group pre- and post-brushing was statistically significant. Intergroup comparison of manual brushing group with modified oral irrigation group shows P {\textless}  0.05 was statistically significant. Conclusion: Within the limitation of the present study, it has been found novel pediatric oral hygiene need Station is more effective than manual brushing since it combined the effect of brushing, flossing (water floss), and rinsing in children simultaneously and at the same time did not demand any special motor skill.},

abstract = {Results: Of the 961 patients who consented, 871 returned baseline questionnaires (210 usual care, 219 nasal irrigation, 232 steam inhalation and 210 combined treatment). A total of 671 (77.0{\%}) of the 871 participants reported RSDI scores at 3 months. Patients' RSDI scores improved more with nasal irrigation than without nasal irrigation by 3 months (crude change -7.42 v. -5.23; estimated adjusted mean difference between groups -2.51, 95{\%} confidence interval -4.65 to -0.37). By 6 months, significantly more patients maintained a 10-point clinically important improvement in the RSDI score with nasal irrigation (44.1{\%} v. 36.6{\%}); fewer used over-the-counter medications (59.4{\%} v. 68.0{\%}) or intended to consult a doctor in future episodes. Steam inhalation reduced headache but had no significant effect on other outcomes. The proportion of participants who had adverse effects was the same in both intervention groups.              Rhinosinusitis probably affects more than 25 million Americans and 2.5 million Canadians.1 Quality of life of patients with chronic or recurrent sinusitis has been reported to be similar to congestive heart disease and chronic pulmonary disease.2 Antibiotics are prescribed for nearly all patients with sinusitis,3 but the evidence is modest4 and an international priority is to contain antibiotic resistance.5 Steam inhalation is widely advocated in rhinosinusitis, but a Cochrane review of steam for the "common cold" found equivocal evidence,6 and a recent primary care trial found no benefit and some harm (mild thermal injury) for pragmatic advice to inhale steam twice daily for a range of respiratory tract infections.7 The Cochrane review of nasal saline irrigation reported benefit.8 However, most of the trials were small, mainly from secondary care settings, and the review documented symptom data from only 129 participants, with high heterogeneity. Two small randomized controlled trials included some participants from primary care settings.9,10 One of the studies compared a gravity-based nasal irrigation device with routine care among 76 participants mainly from primary care settings; it found that symptoms im10.1503/cmaj.160362 proved very little in the control group (by 1 point on the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index [RSDI] converted to a 100-point scale), as compared with a 14-point improvement in the irrigation group.9 The other (published since the Cochrane review) compared a positive-pressure squeeze bottle with saline nasal spray among 121 volunteers from various sources and found an 8.5-point improvement in the control group, as compared with a 15-point improvement in the irrigation group.10              The RSDI scores improved with nasal irrigation, but the control group's scores also improved. The 2- to 3-point difference between the irrigation and control groups, and a number needed to treat of about 13, was smaller than in 2 prior US trials (by [David Rabago MD] and colleagues9 and Pynnonen and colleages10), which enrolled volunteer patients from primary care, secondary care and community settings. In the US studies, participants in the nasal irrigation groups reported changes on 100-point scales of 14 and 15 points,9,10 as compared with 1 and 8.5 points reported by the control groups.9,10 Several factors may have contributed to the differences: Rabago and colleagues allowed participants to know their previous ratings, which may have anchored the control group responses, and provided individualized training (including video, live demonstration and coached practice to ensure proficiency), which was valued.18 Pynnonen and colleagues also allowed coached practice, and both studies had more follow-up contacts and diary monitoring. These more intensive approaches may have increased treatment effect through adherence. However, participants in our study used irrigation on most days, and the impact was the same among participants who irrigated more often. Although the number of irrigations may not explain the discrepancies, the quality and duration of irrigation may still be relevant. Rabago and colleagues9 assessed a more severely affected sample; however, we found no evidence of greater effectiveness among participants in our study who had higher RSDI scores at baseline. Participants in the 2 US studies were younger (10 and 6 years younger on average than our study population, respectively) and had a much shorter history of sinus complaints; therefore, symptoms may have been more amenable to change. Culturally, nasal irrigation is popular in the US, and expectations about benefit may be higher.},

abstract = {Deficit irrigation can play an important role in increasing water use efficiency (WUE) and reduced amount of irrigation. Deficit irrigation generally refers to fully irrigated crops where water is reduced or withheld during certain growth stages. In this study, a series of greenhouse and open field experiments were conducted using a deficit irrigation program on cucumber crops under drip irrigation during 2007–2010 growing seasons. The layout of the experiment was a completely randomized design with four replicates. Irrigation treatments consisted of five levels of ETc (30, 40, 60, 80, and 100{\%} of ETc) in addition to traditional practice by farmers. At 60 and 80{\%} treatments, deficit irrigation tested at different growth stages (development, med, and late stages of the growth) for a total of 14 treatments at each experiment. The maximum amount of water applied to the crop was 332 mm for the 100{\%}ETc treatment while the minimum water applied was 100 mm for 30{\%}Etc treatment, and 600 mm for traditional practice by the farmers in the region. The calculated ETc ranged from between 95 and 316 mm for the different treatments. The objective of the study was to determine the crop water requirements in both the open field and greenhouse and calculate crop response factor (ky) and WUE of cucumber crop using a deficit irrigation program at different stages of growth. Results indicated that a cucumber could stand the shortage of water during the growth and crop response (Ky) values ranging between 0.7 and 0.98. However, the amount of water used was much lower than that of the traditional method used by farmers in the region. Water use efficiency (WUE) and water productivity (WP) values increased when water amounts decreased with the exception of the traditional irrigation; these values decreased to 45.6 and 24 kg/m3, respectively. The highest values at much stressed treatment 30{\%} ETc.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of different drip irrigation programs on boll number, shedding percentage, and yield of cotton. The amount of water used was based on free surface evaporation from a screened class-A pan. Irrigation treatments consisted of two different irrigation intervals (I1: 5 days; I2: 10 days), three plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.75; Kcp2: 0.90; Kcp3: 1.05) and two different wetting factors (P1: 0.70 (constant) and P2: based on cover percentage of the crop). The first irrigation was carried out when the available water in the 120cm of the soil profile was at the 40{\%} level. The results revealed significant linear relationships between cotton yield-irrigation water and boll number-shedding percentage. On the other hand, the shedding was decreased by increasing the amount of applied irrigation and irrigation interval. Therefore, the yield increased by increasing the boll number. Furthermore, it was found that there was a significant (P0.01) inverse linear relationship between the shedding rate and boll number.},

abstract = {Sustainability of plant production activities and improvement of irrigated lands in arid and semi-arid regions totally depend on efficient use of available water resources. Such an efficient use of water resources can be provided through assessment of water–yield relationships and identification of proper irrigation programs, schedules, and operational principles. There are no studies carried out to determine water–yield relations of oleic-type sunflower plants grown over large areas in Konya plain. In this study, different irrigation intervals (S) and crop-pan coefficients (Kcp) were used in drip irrigation of sunflower plants in Konya which is located at the Middle Anatolia in Turkey. The primary objective was to determine the effects of irrigation levels and intervals on yield and quality parameters of sunflower plants. Experiments were conducted in 2013–2014 growing seasons in 3 × 5 factorial design with 4 replications. Three different irrigation intervals (S5:5, S10:10, and S15:15-day) and five different crop-pan coefficients (Kcp1.25:125{\%} of pan evaporation, Kcp1.00:100{\%} of pan evaporation, Kcp0.75:75{\%} of pan evaporation, Kcp0.50:50{\%} of pan evaporation, and Kcp0.00:rain-fed without irrigation) were used in this study. In an average of 2 years, the greatest seed yield (5481 kg/ha) was obtained from S10Kcp1.25 with the greatest water consumption (748.7 mm). As compared with S10Kcp1.25 treatment, about 25{\%} decrease was observed in yield of Kcp0.75 treatments irrigated at 5- and 10-day intervals. Such a decrease was identified as 15{\%} in Kcp1.00 treatments irrigated at 15-day intervals. Therefore, for optimum seed yields from sunflower plants grown in Konya plain, irrigation intervals should not exceed 10 days. Also, crop-pan coefficient should be taken as 1.00 for high seed yields. Again, in an average of 2 years, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of the treatments varied between 0.70 and 3.70 kg/m3 and water use efficiency (WUE) values varied between 0.53 and 0.75 kg/m3. The average yield response factor (ky) was identified as 1.14. Since the value is greater than 1, it was concluded that sunflower plants were sensitive to water deficits under Konya conditions.},

abstract = {The aim of present study was to investigate effects of different irrigation intervals and fertilizers on total lipid, fatty acid and sugar accumulation of Braeburn apple cultivar under Mediterranean climatic conditions. Irrigation program was performed for two consecutive years with three different intervals (1, 3 and 7 days). In fertilization, 40 g N, 32 g P2O5 and 80 g K sub(2)O per tree (with four replications) applied in the same doses for both years, except for the increased N (50 g per tree) for second year, considering the vegetative growth of the trees. The fruits were commercially harvested in 2006 season. The lipid content ranged from 0.22{\%} (daily irrigation without fertilizer) to 0.70{\%} (irrigation in 7 days intervals with fertilizer). The highest fatty acid was obtained from treatment 3 (irrigation in 3 days intervals without fertilizer) (83.95{\%}), while the treatment 6 provided the least value with 64.08{\%} (irrigation in 7 days intervals with fertilizer). Although certain changes on fructose, glucose, sucrose and total sugars content were detected, the differences were not statistically significantly among the treatments.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the effect of different irrigation
programs and nitrogen (N) levels on N concentration, uptake and
utilisation by the processing tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum). The
amount of water used was determined based on a screened class-A pan.
Irrigation treatments consisted of 2 different irrigation intervals
(I-5, 5 days; I-10, 10 days) and 3 plant-pan coefficients (K(cp)0.50,
0.50; K(cp)0.75, 0.75; K(cp)1.00, 1.00). Nitrogen treatments consisted
of 3 N levels (N-0, 0 kg/ha; N-80, 80 kg/ha; N-160, 160 kg/ha). The
irrigation interval, plant- pan coefficient and N fertiliser rate
affected all parameters examined; however, theNfertiliser rate had the
greatest impact. Nitrogen applications increased N concentrations in the
leaf, tomato and vegetative biomass. Plant total N uptake and benefit
rate from fertiliser was highest with the N-160, I-10 and K(cp)0.75 and
K(cp)1.00 treatments. Results show that the N-160, I-10 and K(cp)0.75
treatments can be used for increasing plant N uptake and the benefit
rate from fertiliser.},

abstract = {This research was conducted in a polyethylene greenhouse during spring season of 2010 to determine the effects of different irrigation programs on biomass, yield-and water use efficiency of cucumber plants grafted on different commercial rootstocks. Four interspecific hybrids of Cucurbita maxima Duch. × C. moschata Duch. (RS841, Nunhems 9075, Maximus and TZ148) and one Lageneria siceraria (Macis) were used and compared with a self-grafted treatment ('Gordion') which was evaluated as control. Three irrigation programs were applied based on indoor integrated solar radiation levels of 1, 2 and 4 MJ m-2. The volume of applied nutrient solution was adjusted according to the rate of drained solution to applied solution. The experimental design was two factorial randomized blocks with 3 replicates. Plant growth, yield and water use efficiency showed differences according to the used rootstocks under different irrigation programs. The highest yield was in RS841 (22.55 kg m-2), followed by TZ148 and Maximus in the 2 MJ m-2 irrigation program. The yield of Macis was the lowest and was followed by the self grafted treatment. There were no significant differences among the rootstocks in the 4 MJ m-2 irrigation program. It was concluded that the rootstocks RS841, TZ148 and Maximus could be used successfully in greenhouse cucumber growing with the irrigation program based on indoor integrated solar radiation level of 2 MJ m-2.},

abstract = {Irrigation is of great importance to sesame production in Mediterranean-type environments due to positive effect on flower and capsule numbers. Water stress limits sesame growth and development. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different irrigation programs on flower and capsule numbers, shedding percentage, and yield of sesame. The amount of water used was based on free surface evaporation from a screened class-A pan. Irrigation treatments consisted of three different irrigation intervals (I1: 7-day; I2: 14-day; I3: 21-day), four plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.60; Kcp2: 0.80; Kcp3: 1.00 and Kcp4: 1.20). The first irrigation was carried out when the available water was at 40{\%} level in the 90cm of the soil profile. The results revealed significant linear relationships among the irrigation water, water consumption and total number of flower per plant. On the other hand, the highest total number of flower per plant and the highest shedding percentage were obtained from 7-day intervals. Irrigation interval–irrigation amount interaction was significant for the number of sound capsule per plant. The highest number of sound capsule was obtained from Kcp3 treatment at I1 irrigation interval. Therefore, sesame yield increased by increasing the capsule number.},

abstract = {This study was carried out to determine the effects of different irrigation programs on yield and quality parameters of eggplant under greenhouse conditions, using Class A pan evaporation calculations and different plant-pan coefficients. Irrigation water was applied through drip irrigation method twice a week during the growing period. Irrigation treatments consisted of five plant-pan coefficients (S1: k sub(cp) = non-irrigation, S2: k sub(cp) = 0.50, S3: k sub(cp) = 0.75, S4: k sub(cp) = 1.00 and S5: k sub(cp) = 1.25). The amount of irrigation water ranged between 95.2 and 238.7 mm among the treatments. Evapotranspiration (ET) values varied from 93.1 to 466.3 mm for the treatments. The highest yield was obtained from the S3 and S4 treatments. A significant polynomial correlation was obtained between the yield and irrigation water, and between the yield and ET (P {\textless} 0.01). This indicated that when irrigation water and ET increased, yield also increased to a certain point. However, when the amount of irrigation water exceeded the plant water requirement, eggplant yield decreased. Yield response factor (K sub(y)) was determined as 0.81. Since K sub(y) {\textless} 1, eggplants were not sensitive to water deficiency. In addition, the highest water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) values were calculated in the S3 (12.9 kgm super(-3)) and S2 (44.2 kgm super(-3)) treatments, while the lowest WUE and IWUE values were calculated in the S5 (7.9 and 15.5 kgm super(-3)) treatment to which the highest irrigation water was applied. This finding indicated that WUE and IWUE values decreased with the increasing irrigation water and ET. These results suggested that S3 (k sub(cp) = 0.75) treatment can be the most appropriate irrigation program for eggplant with higher yield and WUE under greenhouse conditions.},

abstract = {A soil physics theory of solute movement through a drained saturated zone underlying agricultural land is introduced into a long-term economic analysis of farm-level irrigation management; this is an alternative to the immediate, homogeneous blending assumption employed in previous studies as a base for calculating changes in drainage salinity over time. Using data from California, the effect of drainage salinity evolution is analyzed through a year-by-year profit optimization under the requirement of on-farm drainage disposal. Paths of optimal land allocation among crop production with fresh surface water, saline drainage reuse and evaporation ponds appear to depend on the relative profitability of the first two; that of reuse is affected by the trend of drainage salinity. Tile spacing and environmental regulations associated with evaporation ponds affect the timing of evaporation pond construction. The system converges into a solution involving both drainage-disposal activities; this solution includes an outlet for salts and is therefore sustainable. Following this strategy, the system is asymptotically approaching a steady state that possesses both hydrological and salt balances. Economic implications associated with land retirement programs in California are discussed.},

abstract = {Semi-arid environments are strongly limited by water and nutrients, which hinders their recovery after anthropogenic disturbances. Application of compost and irrigation can improve soil fertility and enhance vegetation growth during the restoration of these environments. However, these restoration techniques may also favor the establishment of opportunistic communities and arrest natural succession. Mid and long-term assessments ({\textgreater}10 years) of the improvements in soil conditions and water availability after ecological restoration are scarce, although this is particularly important given the slow dynamics characterizing these environments. We assessed the effect of two levels of irrigation and compost addition (full-factorial design) in a limestone quarry under semi-arid conditions after a 13 years-period. These treatments were applied in addition to topsoiling, hydroseeding and plantation of woody species in the entire study area. Whereas the latter restoration treatments produced an overall increase in soil carbon content and salinity during this period (78{\%} more soil carbon, over 200 $\mu$S/cm [nearly four times] more salinity), watering and compost addition did not affect the accumulation of soil organic carbon (at 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) or soil salinity. In contrast to the observed short-term effects, water and compost addition did not affect the cover, biomass and diversity of the herbaceous layer, or the survival and growth of planted woody species 13 years after the treatments ended. Fading treatment effects occurred despite substantial changes in vegetation structure and composition between year 1 and year 13 (25{\%} more herbaceous species, 13{\%} less biomass, up to 80{\%} decline in woody seedling survival). Conversely, similar to what we observed 13 years ago, the survival of woody plants was affected by the composition of the herbaceous layer, with species-specific responses to their cover and composition. Our study illustrates temporal shifts in the effects of two commonly applied restoration treatments, and highlights the need for mid- and long-term monitoring programs to properly assess the effectiveness of restoration actions.},

abstract = {In 2001, the Arizona Department of Water Resources implemented an agricultural Best Management Practice (BMP) program. The program was designed to encourage the use of BMPs in irrigation with the goal of increasing the efficient use of water resources on the farm. Several BMPs were identified through meetings with stakeholders, researchers, and scientists. One of the BMPs identified was alternate furrow irrigation. This three-year study was designed to determine the impact of alternate furrow irrigation on surface irrigation water applications and cotton yield. There were two treatments, every furrow (EF) and every other furrow (EOF). Lint yields were 1794 and 1694 kg/ha in 2006; 1795 and 1902 kg/ha in 2007; and 1365 and 1237 kg/ha in 2008 for the EF and EOF treatments, respectively. Seasonal irrigation water applications were 187.7 and 162.3 cm in 2006; 151.4 and 137.2 cm in 2007; and 184.1 and 132.6 cm in 2008 for EF and EOF treatments, respectively. The results indicate that an average of 30.5 cm of water can be saved by the implementation of an alternate furrow irrigation scheme without significantly reducing lint yield.},

abstract = {Removing basal leaves 2 weeks postbloom significantly reduced powdery mildew severity on clusters in each year of a study in a New York Chardonnay vineyard. In contrast, removing leaves 5 weeks postbloom had no effect. The effect was not significantly different whether one leaf or two above and below each cluster was removed. Shoot density of vertical shoot-positioned (VSP) vines was lower than that of Umbrella-Kniffen vines and was associated with a significant reduction in disease development in one year of the study. When VSP-training was combined with early leaf removal in the absence of fungicide sprays, it reduced mean disease severity by 32{\%} relative to untreated clusters on Umbrella-Kniffen-trained vines. However, there was no effect of training system in the second year of the study. In South Australia, doubling the volume of irrigation water supplied to vines that received a standard reduced deficit irrigation program resulted in two- and seven-fold increases in foliar powdery mildew severity in two consecutive seasons. Results highlight that viticultural practices targeted primarily at controlling vine growth and crop quantity and quality can also significantly affect the development of powdery mildew.},

abstract = {Irrigation and nitrogen (N) are two crucial factors affecting perennial grass seed production. To investigate the effects of irrigation and N rate on seed yield (SY), yield components, and water use efficiency (WUE) of Cleistogenes songorica (Roshevitz) Ohwi, an ecologically significant perennial grass, a four-year (2016–2019) field trial was conducted in an arid region of northwestern China. Two irrigation regimes (I1 treatment: irrigation at tillering stage; I2 treatment: irrigation at tillering, spikelet initiation, and early flowering stages) and four N rates (0, 60, 120, 180 kg ha−1) were arranged. Increasing amounts of both irrigation and N improved SY, evapotranspiration, WUE, and related yield components like fertile tillers m−2 (FTSM) and seeds spikelet−1. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed between 120 and 180 kg N ha−1 treatments for most variables. The highest SY and WUE was obtained with treatment combination of I2 plus 120 kg N ha−1 with four-year average values of 507.3 kg ha−1 and 1.8 kg ha−1 mm−1, respectively. Path coefficient and contribution analysis indicated that FTSM was the most important yield component for SY, with direct path coefficient and contribution coefficient of 0.626 and 0.592. Overall, we recommend I2 treatment (three irrigations) together with 120 kg N ha−1 to both increase SY and WUE, especially in arid regions. Future agronomic managements and breeding programs for seed should mainly focus on FTSM. This study will enable grass seed producers, plant breeders, and government program directors to more effectively target higher SY of C. songorica.},

abstract = {This research was conducted in order to determine effects of irrigation based on different moisture levels of growing medium on yield, fruit quality and water use efficiency of soilless grown greenhouse tomatoes during fall and spring seasons of 2010 and 2011 in PE covered greenhouse. The treatments were composed of full and two deficit irrigation programs. Irrigations were started automatically according to the soil moisture sensor readings when available moisture capacity of substrate was consumed 20{\%} (full), 40{\%} (deficit 1) or 60{\%} (deficit 2) respectively in the plant root zone. Experiments were set according to the randomized blocks design with four replicates. Drip irrigation method was used in nutrient solution supply and timing was based on soil moisture sensors placed at root zone. The duration of irrigation was set according to the daily leaching fraction which was kept around 30-40{\%}. In both seasons the highest total and marketable yield was obtained from plants under full irrigation. Compared with full irrigation, total yield in autumn decreased 19.2 and 19.3{\%} in deficit 1 and deficit 2, respectively, while it was 35.2 and 32.1{\%} lower in spring. It was determined that plant growth, water use efficiency (WUE) and some fruit quality parameters showed differences in irrigation treatments according to growing seasons. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, EC of fruit juice, total antioxidants and vitamin C increased with water deficit. The highest WUE was determined in deficit 2 in autumn and full irrigation in spring. It was concluded that water deficit could be applied in autumn, however, more attention should be paid to irrigation since there are more risks in spring season production.},

The use of genotypes with tolerance to drought might represent an alternative solution to water shortage. The aim of this study was to investigate the yield and qualitative performance of a plant genetic collection under water stress condition in order to 1) select and introduce in breeding programs germplasm that exhibits the tolerance to water stress; 2) recommend to the farmers genotypes able to tolerate water stress conditions. The experiments were conducted at the Vegetable Research and Development Station in Bacau, Romania, in the period of 2011-2018. Four genotypes of mung bean, ten of tomatoes and six of peppers were tested under three irrigation regimes (optimal irrigation supply - V1, irrigation only at critical moments - V2, irrigation only before planting/sowing V3). Yield performance and some qualitative parameters, such as pigments and soluble solids were determined at harvest. In all of the investigated crops, yield depends on soil water status throughout the growing season and also on genotype. Any restriction related to water irrigation supply is likely to induce a decrease in crop yield. The deficit irrigation exhibits a decrease of crop yield in case of all investigated material. Differences were recorded between investigated genotypes in relation to water stress tolerance.},

Tomato plants were grown in volcanic tuff by using open and closed nutrition systems. The nutrient solution was applied according to indoor integrated solar radiation levels viz 1.00, 2.00, 3.00 and 4.00 MJ.m-2. The results indicate that there was no significant difference between open and closed systems (13.3 and 12.1 kg.m-2, respectively) in respect to yield in autumn, whereas open system had 36{\%} higher yield than closed system in spring season (16.2 kg.m-2). Among the tested irrigation programs, 1.0 MJ.m-2 had the highest yields in both of the growing seasons. In this regard, the highest water and nutrient consumption was obtained from 1.00 MJ.m-2. The amount of water saving provided in the closed system was at the rate of 24-33 {\%} in autumn and 33-39 {\%} in spring as compared to that of the open system. The overall evaluation of the nutrients applied, consumed and drained out during the experiment revealed that the average nutrient economy in the closed system was 33 {\%} in autumn and 43 {\%} in spring compared with open system.},

abstract = {In three growing seasons from 2009 to 2012, we investigated the effects of different combinations of pre-sowing irrigation and supplemental irrigation on crop water consumption, grain yield, and water productivity (WP) of winter wheat. One conventional irrigation schedule (irrigation applied at the overwintering and jointing stages) can stabilize wheat yield and WP with low or sufficient rainfall, but another conventional irrigation schedule (irrigation applied at the reviving and filling stages) decreased wheat yield and WP significantly with continuous droughts throughout winter and spring. The winter wheat with the pre-sowing irrigation and supplemental irrigation applied at the recovery or elongation stage had a grain yield and WP in the seasons with less rainfall during the early growing stage that was higher than 7500kgha super(-1) and 1.85kgm super(-3), respectively. In contrast, the irrigation schedule with the pre-sowing irrigation and irrigation applied at the grain-filling stage decreased wheat yield and WP significantly in the seasons with continuous droughts throughout winter and spring. These results indicated that combined with pre-sowing irrigation, supplemental irrigation should be applied at the recovery stage and not later than the jointing stage; otherwise, the grain yield and WP of winter wheat will be decreased.Original Abstract: Resume Nous avons etudie les effets de differentes combinaisons d'irrigation de pre-semis et d'irrigation de complement sur la consommation d'eau des cultures, le rendement en grains et la productivite de l'eau (WP) du ble d'hiver pour les trois campagnes de 2009 a 2012. Un calendrier conventionnel d'irrigation (irrigation appliquee aux stades d'hivernage et de developpement) peut stabiliser le rendement du ble et WP avec des precipitations faibles ou suffisantes, mais un autre programme d'irrigation classique (irrigation appliquee a la revigoration et aux phases de remplissage) a vu diminuer significativement le rendement du ble et WP en cas de secheresse continue tout au long de l'hiver et du printemps. En annee peu arrosee, le ble d'hiver avec une irrigation de pre-semis et une irrigation d'appoint appliquees aux phases de reprise de croissance et d'allongement avait un rendement en grains et WP superieurs a 7500kgha super(-1) et 1.85kgm super(-3), respectivement, ceci dans le cas d'une saison peu arrosee en phase de croissance. En revanche, une irrigation de pre-semis et une irrigation appliquee a la phase de remplissage du grain ont significativement diminue le rendement du ble et WP en cas d'hiver et de printemps secs. Ces resultats indiquent que combinee avec l'irrigation de pre-semis, l'irrigation d'appoint doit etre appliquee a la phase de recuperation et pas plus tard que la phase de developpement; autrement, le rendement en grains et WP du ble d'hiver seront affectes.},

abstract = {Regions and basins suffering from water scarcity have promoted the modernization of irrigation systems, defined as irrigation efficiency enhancement as a measure for the adaptation to a growing demand and a limited supply of water resources. In the period 2002–2015, Spain carried out an intense irrigation modernization process with the aim of achieving significant water savings and higher flexibility and to guarantee supply, among other favourable outcomes (e.g. environmental and socio-economic). Nevertheless, certain unfavourable effects of irrigation modernization also need to be discussed. This study analyses these effects in Spain based upon a DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States, Impacts, and Responses) framework and a wide-ranging review of the existing empirical literature. Our findings are highly relevant to inform decision-makers in the planning of future irrigation modernization programmes worldwide.},

abstract = {This paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation in community-managed water user associations, in a context where assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these institutions existed before training began. We also examine whether participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm operations to other workers, in a context where only managers have been directly trained, almost all managers are male, and females are increasingly operating farms. We collected microdata from 1855 farms in Southern Tajikistan, where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training, while those in the other 40 received shorter training. These {\^{a}}€˜treatment{\^{a}}€™ and {\^{a}}€˜control{\^{a}}€™ subdistricts were selected by constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to training duration. Farms were then selected from a census using a stratified random sampling process. A difference-in-difference technique with right-hand-side covariates is employed, where both sets of data were collected after training was completed. This choice of econometric methods controls against farm-level selection effects, but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error. Longer training has a causal effect on increasing participation in WUAs. Results also demonstrate that when male workers not directly trained operate farms, participation is not affected; however, participation is negatively affected when female workers operate farms. These results provide evidence for designing irrigation management programs to target female workers directly, in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on active farm participation.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to determine the amount of irrigation water, irrigation interval, and water consumption that gave the greatest yield, to determine the effect of irrigation on fruit quality characteristics, and to investigate variations in soil moisture in Redhaven peaches irrigated by drip irrigation in the Aegean region of Turkey. The study was performed in 2003 and 2004 on split plots in randomized blocks with three replications. Main treatments were 3 and 6$\backslash${\#}days between irrigations, and subtreatments comprised four different pan coefficients (K$\backslash$Dp1.25$\backslash$N, K$\backslash$Dp1.00$\backslash$N, K$\backslash$Dp0.75$\backslash$N, and K$\backslash$Dp0.50$\backslash$N). According to the 2-year averages of peach yields, the effect on yield of the amount of irrigation water was found to be significant (p{\textless}0.01), but the effect of the irrigation interval was found not to be significant. Total yield varied between 5,966 and 16,340 kg ha$\backslash$U-1$\backslash$N, and marketable yield between 5,349 and 14,164 kg ha$\backslash$U-1$\backslash$N, according to irrigation treatments. A maximum average yield of 14,101 kg ha$\backslash$U-1$\backslash$N was obtained from treatment K$\backslash$Dp1.00$\backslash$N. Average irrigation water amount for this treatment was 482$\backslash${\#}mm, average water consumption was 705$\backslash${\#}mm, and the K$\backslash$Dpc$\backslash$N value was 0.785. Maximum water-use efficiency (WUE) of 2.02 kg m$\backslash$U-3$\backslash$N was obtained from K$\backslash$Dp1.00$\backslash$N. The yield response factor (ky) was found to be 1.2. Weight of individual fruit varied between 203 and 253$\backslash${\#}g, height varied from 6.3$\backslash$-6.6$\backslash${\#}cm, diameter from 7.2$\backslash$-7.7$\backslash${\#}cm, soluble dry matter from 10.8$\backslash$-14.5{\%}, and juice pH from 4.14$\backslash$-4.37. In the years of the study, the declining trend of soil moisture was greater in the treatments that received little irrigation water than in those that received more. After irrigation was ended, soil moisture decreased rapidly and eventually reached the wilting point. To conclude, when setting up a drip-irrigation program for fully grown peach trees in the Aegean region, the irrigation interval may be 3 or 6$\backslash${\#}days. The amount of water to be applied at each irrigation can be determined by correcting the total evaporation from a Class-A evaporation pan over the chosen irrigation interval by a coefficient of 0.785.},

abstract = {Residential and commercial landscapes provide home and business owners with several benefits. These benefits range from improved air quality and flood control to the reduction of noise and breakdown of organic chemicals. However, these landscapes are routinely overwatered which can lead to plant disease, nutrient pollution, and large amounts of water being wasted. Utah State University, in conjunction with the Center for Water Efficient Landscaping (CWEL), the Utah Division of Natural Resources and Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, conducted an experiment to determine if Wi-Fi-enabled smart irrigation controllers conserve water as compared to average residential irrigation amounts and manually programmed controllers.    A two-year study was completed at the Utah State University Greenville Research Farm in Logan, Utah. The three different Wi-Fi-enabled controllers tested were selected because of their inclusion in a state-wide rebate program to incentivize residents to save water. Average residential irrigation amounts were determined based on thousands of water audits performed by the USU Extension Water Check Program. The manually programmed irrigation controller was selected based on local availability and distributor recommendations. When compared to the average residential irrigation amounts in the state of Utah, Wi-Fi-enabled irrigation controllers applied significantly less water. When compared to the manually programmed irrigation controllers (programmed according to USU Extension recommendations), the highest performing Wi-Fi-enabled irrigation controller applied similar amounts of water.},

abstract = {Importance Recent studies suggest that theophylline added to saline nasal irrigation (SNI) can be an effective treatment for postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD), a growing public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of theophylline added to SNI compared with placebo for COVID-19–related OD. Design, Setting, and Participants This triple-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted virtually between March 15 and August 31, 2021. Adults residing in Missouri or Illinois were recruited during this time period if they had OD persisting for 3 to 12 months following suspected COVID-19 infection. Data analysis was conducted from October to December 2021. Interventions Saline sinus rinse kits and bottles of identical-appearing capsules with either 400 mg of theophylline (treatment) or 500 mg of lactose powder (control) were mailed to consenting study participants. Participants were instructed to dissolve the capsule contents into the saline rinse and use the solution to irrigate their nasal cavities in the morning and at night for 6 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the difference in the rate of responders between the treatment and the control arms, defined as a response of at least slightly better improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Questionnaire for Olfactory Disorders, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey on general health, and COVID-19–related questions. Results A total of 51 participants were enrolled in the study; the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (13.1) years, and 36 (71{\%}) participants were women. Participants were randomized to SNI with theophylline (n = 26) or to SNI with placebo (n = 25). Forty-five participants completed the study. At the end of treatment, 13 (59{\%}) participants in the theophylline arm reported at least slight improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (responders) compared with 10 (43{\%}) in the placebo arm (absolute difference, 15.6{\%}; 95{\%} CI, −13.2{\%} to 44.5{\%}). The median difference for the UPSIT change between baseline and 6 weeks was 3.0 (95{\%} CI, −1.0 to 7.0) for participants in the theophylline arm and 0.0 (95{\%} CI, −2.0 to 6.0) for participants in the placebo arm. Mixed-model analysis revealed that the change in UPSIT scores through study assessments was not statistically significantly different between the 2 study arms. Eleven (50{\%}) participants in the theophylline arm and 6 (26{\%}) in the placebo arm had a change of 4 or more points in UPSIT scores from baseline to 6 weeks. The difference in the rate of responders as measured by the UPSIT was 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, −4{\%} to 52{\%}) in favor of theophylline. Conclusions and Relevance This randomized clinical trial suggests that the clinical benefit of theophylline nasal irrigations on olfaction in participants with COVID-19–related OD is inconclusive, though suggested by subjective assessments. Larger studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of this treatment more fully.},

abstract = {Background  Continuous comprehensive treatment is still needed after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) to promote the recovery of sinus mucosal morphology and function. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nasal irrigation is a promising external treatment of TCM, but at present, the application of TCM nasal irrigation after ESS for CRS has not been recommended by the guidelines. Therefore, this article aims to develop a systematic overview and meta-analysis protocol to assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal nasal rinse for CRS recovery after ESS. Methods Seven databases shall be retrieved from their inception until December 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials will be covered in the study. The outcome indicators of the survey will consist of efficacy, visual analogue scale score, Lund-Kennedy score for nasal endoscopy, Lund-Mackay score for sinus computed tomography and other secondary outcome indicators. The selection of literature, extraction of data, and methodological quality evaluation of literature shall be conducted by two researchers separately. If there is any dispute, it can be discussed and solved by a third researcher. Review Manager 5.3 software will be applied to data analysis. Results The article will make a detailed research programme to explore the efficacy and safety of TCM nasal irrigation on CRS recovery after ESS. Conclusion This protocol is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of TCM nasal rinse for CRS recovery after ESS, and can provide corresponding evidence-based medical evidence.

abstract = {Background  Surgical management of complex perianal fistula associated with pararectal cavities can be challenging. We hypothesised that healing of the pararectal cavities prior to healing of the fistula leads to a better outcome. We aimed to assess the efficacy of irrigation catheters in the healing of pararectal cavities associated with fistula-in-ano. Methods This study design was consistent with IDEAL stage 2a (development) and was conducted at the Professorial Surgical Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo. Thirty-two patients with complex fistulae with a pararectal cavity (detected by 2D-Endoanal ultrasounography-EAUS) were included. All patients underwent examination under anaesthesia (EUA), during which insertion of an irrigation catheter to the pararectal cavity and tagging of the primary fistula tract with a drainage seton was done. Patients were advised to irrigate with antiseptic solution and were followed-up at three weekly intervals to assess cavity reduction. Results The majority were males (96.8{\%}, n = 31). The primary fistula tract in 26 patients (81.2{\%}) was trans-sphincteric and was inter-sphincteric in 6 patients (18.7{\%}). Mean time of cavity contraction was 34.78 (range, 21–112) days. Complete healing was seen in 87.5{\%} (n = 28), with 3 patients (9.37{\%}) being lost to follow-up and 1 patient (3.12{\%}) having a persistent perianal fistula after 6 months of follow-up. Those who had complete healing were followed up for a median duration of 6 (range, 3–20) months and there were no recurrences. Conclusions Irrigation in the management of pararectal cavities yielded satisfactory results. A case control trial with larger numbers and assessment of cavity size pre and post procedure by 3D-EAUS/MRI evaluation would be necessary for more objective evaluation of the efficacy of this novel intervention.},

abstract = {Context: The use of chemicals solutions and means of activation is of utmost importance in endodontic treatment. Aims: This study compared three activation techniques used in the final irrigation of the endodontic treatment. Subjects and Methods: Eighty uniradicular teeth were instrumented with the Protaper Universal system up to F4 file. After decalcification, the teeth had artificial lateral canals created at 2, 4.5 and 6 mm from working length (WL). The groups were randomly divided into four groups (n = 20): control group (C), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) group, continuous ultrasonic irrigation (CUI) group, and easy clean (EC) group. The penetration of the irrigant into the samples was evaluated using image observation using the Image J program. Statistical Analysis Used: The level of agreement among the observers was determined by the Cronbach's alpha test. The likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate possible differences between the groups and the Kendall's W statistic test to verify possible differences between the irrigant penetration levels in the lateral canals. The Fisher's exact test was applied to verify differences by the studied group considering the WL variables and lateral canals. Results: The results showed no statistical difference in the penetration of the irrigator in the main canal when compared to the C, PUI, CUI, and EC groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions: The method using a positive syringe and needle pressure was not able to effectively carry the irrigator to the artificially made lateral canals, whereas PUI, CUI, and EC were equally efficient in this regard (P {\textless} 0.01).},

abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this systematic review was to systematically evaluate and summarize the outcomes of  in vitro studies comparing Endoactivator irrigation and Endovac irrigation techniques for removing calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH]2) medicament from the root canals. Materials and Methods: The research question was developed according to the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome strategy. A computerized literature search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase. A hand search of the reference lists of identified articles was performed to separate relevant articles. Two reviewers critically assessed the studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and processed. Evaluation of the risk of bias of the studies was performed independently by the two reviewers. Results: After study selection, 61 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 13 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Since significant heterogeneity was found in the methodologies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions: On the basis of available evidence, we determined that Endoactivator irrigation technique showed better performance in removing Ca(OH)2intracanal medicaments from middle third and coronal third area of the root canals and Endovac irrigation technique showed better performance from the apical third area of the root canals. Due to the limitations, small sample sizes, and low number of included studies, further research is needed to confirm our results.},

abstract = {Ambiguity over the effectiveness of agricultural intervention is more pronounced in rural areas where the majority of North West Nigeria's poor population, and those involved in agriculture, reside. Further characterising these areas is the paucity of research on the issue of differentiation within the smallholder community. Specifically, definite classification of households based on efficiency, food security and income status remains inadequate. The study explores smallholder households' differentials on the basis of these three phenomena, and other factors that affect smallholder typologies. Data was collected from 306 randomly selected smallholders involved in the Middle Rima Valley Irrigation Project, Sokoto State, Nigeria. Smallholders' technical efficiency and households' Food Consumption Score (FCS) were assessed. Also, Pearson correlation analysis, a segmentation approach using cluster analysis and multinomial regression model were used for the study. The study showed that the mean efficiency level of smallholder farms was 85.9{\%} and that the majority of the households were food insecure. It also established a significant positive relationship between efficiency, income and food security status, and some degree of class stratification among the households. Differences in household characteristics determine variation in the efficiency, food security and income of households. Farm size, farming experience and diversification were major factors influencing households' livelihoods. Recommendations emanating from the study include an increased focus on improving human capital, sustainable intensification and livelihoods diversification.},

A Southern European case study assesses farmers' long and short-run adaptation responses under climate change and policy interventions with a discrete stochastic programming model. Results indicate that climate change will likely have negative impacts on irrigation activities and water-dependent ecosystems in Southern Europe. However, the severity of impacts depends on government policy settings and farmers' adaptation responses. The comparison between water market and irrigation subsidy policies shows the advantages of water markets over irrigation subsidies in terms of both private and social benefits. These findings could guide policymakers on the design of efficient water institutions and policies to address climate change in the irrigated agriculture of Southern Europe. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. Adaptive governance relies on the collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders in multiple institutions and organizations at different times and places. In the context of unprecedented water policy and management reform in Australia over the past decade, we add to insights from resilience scholarship, which identifies adaptive governance as critical to improving complex social-ecological systems, such as water management. We present empirical research with agricultural industry stakeholders who are responding to a major change initiative to renew or modernize the largest irrigation system in Australia's Murray Darling Basin and who ask: “What can a resilience assessment intervention contribute to adaptive water governance in this context?” Using resilience approaches and connecting these with insights from science and technology studies (STS), we found that a particular resilience assessment intervention supported dairy industry stakeholders to manage the complexity, uncertainty, and diversity of an irrigation modernization governance challenge. It did so by explicitly accounting for, representing, and aligning different water governing practices through the use of resilience concepts, a particular resilience assessment tool, and a participatory process for engaging social actors. Possibilities for adaptive governance emerged from the intervention in the form of new joint strategic actions and new understandings, alliances, and roles between people and institutions for addressing irrigation modernization.},

abstract = {Due to the fact that irrigation networks are water and energy hungry and that both resources are scarce, many strategies have been developed to reduce this consumption. Solar energy sources have emerged as a green alternative with lower energy costs and, consequently, lower environmental impacts. In this work, a new methodology is proposed to select a scheduled program for irrigation which minimizes the number of photovoltaic solar panels to be installed and which better fits energy consumption (calculated for discrete potential combinations, assisted by programming software) to available energy obtained by panels without any power conditioning unit. Thus, the irrigation hours available to satisfy the water demands are limited by sunlight, the schedule type of irrigation has to be rigid (rotation predetermined), and the pressure at any node has to be above the minimum pressure required by standards. A case study was undertaken and, after running the software 105 times, the best result was an irrigation schedule which satisfied all the requirements, involving the installation of 651 solar panels and energy consumption of 428.74 kWh per day, to deliver water to orchards of different varieties of citrus fruit spread over 167.7 ha.},

abstract = {Most vegetable crops are salt sensitive, growing inadequately in salinised soils due to the accumulation of toxic ions from prolonged irrigation regimes. Plant biostimulants are a potential tool that can be used to counteract salinity stress and increase crop yield. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of the proprietary protein hydrolysate and Ascophyllum nodosum-derived biostimulant PSI-475 to activate salinity stress tolerance responses in plants. After characterising PSI-475 composition, initial biostimulant activity screening was performed using Arabidopsis thaliana. PSI-475 stimulated primary root growth (+5.5–20.0{\%}) and photosynthetic pigments content (18.8–63.0{\%}) under unstressed and salinity stressed conditions. Subsequently, PSI-475 was assessed by foliar application on tomato plants (cv. Micro-Tom) that received a saline irrigation water program, which caused a significant decrease in fruit yield (−37.5{\%}). Stressed plants treated with PSI-475 increased this parameter by 31.8{\%} versus the stressed control. Experimental data suggest that PSI-475 can alleviate the negative effects of saline irrigation by improving osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis markers. PSI-475 was also able to provide significant yield benefits in unstressed plants (+16.9{\%}) that were associated with improved leaf biochemical markers. The data presented support the use of this precision biostimulant to target the negative effects of salinity stress from irrigation.},

abstract = {Efforts to achieve sustainable irrigation in arid regions must include measures to reduce the waterlogging, salinization, and degradation of water resources that continue to threaten productivity and degrade environmental quality in those areas. Appropriate measures will include the recycling and reuse of saline drainage water on farms and within irrigation districts. Sustainability will require that recycling and reuse are conducted in a manner that does not degrade land and water quality, so that crop yields can be maintained and improved in the future. We describe a strategy for motivating farmers to capture and reuse saline drainage water, with the goal of reducing the volume discharged into evaporation basins or receiving waterways. A regional drainage management program is essential to encourage and support both district-level and farm-level efforts to capture and reuse saline drainage water. Inputs from agronomists, soil scientists, and agricultural engineers will be required to determine optimal reuse strategies (cyclic, blending, and sequential), while minimizing the near- and long-term impacts on soil salinity and crop yields. Also required will be inputs from wildlife ecologists to develop and monitor mediation strategies associated with the disposal of drainage water into evaporation basins. In many cases, economic incentives will be needed to motivate farmers and irrigation districts to optimize the reuse of saline drainage water in crop production, thereby reducing the volume of effluent requiring disposal. We describe agronomic issues, economic incentives, and policy recommendations that may be helpful in achieving sustainability.},

abstract = {This paper provides results of an application of a holistic systematic approach of water accounting using remote sensing and GIS coupled with groundwater modeling to evaluate water saving options by tracking non-beneficial evaporation in the Liuyuankou Irrigation System (LIS) of China. Groundwater rise is a major issue in the LIS, where groundwater levels have risen alarmingly close to the ground surface (within 1m) near the Yellow River. The lumped water balance analysis showed high fallow evaporation losses and which need to be reduced for improving water productivity. The seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETs) was estimated by applying the SEBAL algorithm for 18 NOAA AVHRR-12 images over the year of 1990–1991 (April 1990–March 1991). This analysis was aided by the unsupervised land use classification applied to three Landsat 5 TM images of the study area. SEBAL results confirmed that a fair amount (116.7MCM) of water can be saved by reducing evaporation from fallow land which will result in improved water productivity at the irrigation system. The water accounting indicator (for the analysis period) shows that the process fraction per unit of depleted water (PFdepleted) is 0.52 for LIS, meaning that 52{\%} of the depleted water is consumed by agricultural crops and 48{\%} is lost through non-process depletion. Finally, the groundwater modeling was applied to simulate three land use and water management interventions to assess their effectiveness for both water savings and impact on the groundwater in LIS. MODFLOW's Zone Budget code calculates the groundwater budget of user-specified subregions, the exchange of flows between subregions and also calculates a volumetric water budget for the entire model at the end of each time step. The simulation results showed that fallow evaporation could be reduced between 14.2{\%} (25.51MCM) and 45.3{\%} (81.36MCM) by interventions such as canal lining and groundwater pumping. The reduction in non-beneficial ETs volumes would mean that more water would be available for other uses and it would allow the introduction of more surface water supplies in the area through improved water management strategies. This will ultimately lead to improved water productivity of the LIS system.},

abstract = {Since 1960s in Bangladesh many water development projects have been implemented mainly for flood control and boosting the agriculture. Among them Flood Control Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects are significant. Various studies reveal the many positive and negative impacts of these projects. Although these projects were implemented so as to support irrigation for High Yield Varieties (HYVs) rice, but due to bad engineering construction some areas do not get irrigation facilities. As a result serious environmental consequences result in those areas. The consequences of the FCDI projects on the environment of those areas never been examined systematically. This study is an attempt to examine the impacts of FCDI projects on some of the agricultural and environmental components of an area without irrigation facilities. A Mouza named Nischintapur within Meghna-Donagoda FCDI project was selected for the study. It is assumed that before implementation of this project the characteristics of the environment of the area were almost the same. The FCDI interventions have changed the environment. Therefore, the aims of the study were (1) to identify the impacts of the project on land use, (2) to recognize effects on some of the agricultural components like cropping pattern, intensity, (3) to make a status list of the flora and fauna of the study area; (4) to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the project interventions and IEC (Important Environmental Components) of the study area and (5) to identify the impacts at various environment levels. This study was based on both primary and secondary data. Data were collected from household and Mouza level questionnaire survey, key informants and observation. Mouza map, GIS and statistical methods were used at different stages of the study. The modified EIA method was used for impact assessment of the project in Nischintapur mouza. The study shows that cropping patterns, cropping intensity and crop diversity have changed in the area. The land use of the area has changed. The physical, biological and agricultural environment has been effected for the lack of water. These have an adverse impact on human life. This study has confirmed and exposed the consequences of FCDI project on environmental components inside the embankment of the area, which does not get irrigation facilities.},

abstract = {The distribution of valuable irrigation water using some type of conveyance such as a canal has been in use for thousands of years. Due to excessive seepage loss, many types of lining systems have been used since early times including soil liners, paving bricks, bitumen and clay. With the development of polymers and the expansion of the plastics industry in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, sheet materials such as Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC-soft), Butyl and EPDM Rubber became popular in agricultural applications (Comer et.al, 1999). With the rapid development of the geomembrane industry in the 1970's and 1980's polymeric sheet materials were developed specifically for many civil applications including the waterproofing of distribution canals. EPDM rubber sheeting has proven to be one of the most durable and cost effective exposed synthetic lining system for use in canal rehabilitation. As a successful example of recent installations, the Tulelake Irrigation District (TID) located in Northern California installed over 4 miles of EPDM rubber lining under the guidance of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Historically, the TID has faced loss of deliverable water due to high seepage rates in unlined canals and laterals, approaching 50 percent in some cases. This, in addition to the drought conditions here and in other western and southwestern irrigation districts, has prompted the federal government to initiate a program for the selection and installation of low cost, low tech synthetic canal lining systems. This paper will focus on the selection, cost, installation methods and effectiveness of EPDM rubber canal lining systems as used in the TID emergency seepage control program. In addition, a Texas case history will illustrate the use of EPDM rubber for the repair of old, deteriorated concrete lined canals.},

abstract = {While only 20{\%} of harvested lands are actually irrigated, 40{\%} of global agricultural production originates from irrigated areas. Therefore, assessing irrigation requirements is essential for the development of effective water-related policies for an efficient management of water resources. Moreover, global-scale analyses are becoming increasingly relevant, motivated by globalized production and international trade of food as well as by the need of common strategies to address climate change. In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement, defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833°) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal scales for relevant analyses. The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements. A focus on different areas of the world (California, Northern Italy and India) highlights the wealth of information provided by the model in different climatic conditions. National data of irrigation withdrawals have been used for an extensive comparison with model results. A crop-specific validation has also been made for the State of California, comparing model results with local data of irrigation volume and independent estimates of crop water use. In both cases, we found a good agreement between model results and real data.},

abstract = {Wildlife intrusion has been associated with pathogen contamination of produce. However, few studies have examined pathogen transfer from wildlife feces to pre-harvest produce. This study was performed to calculate transfer coefficients for Escherichia coli from simulated wildlife feces to field-grown lettuce during irrigation. Rabbit feces inoculated with a 3-strain cocktail of non-pathogenic E. coli were placed in a lettuce field 2.5–72 h before irrigation. Following irrigation, the E. coli concentration on the lettuce was determined. After exclusion of an outlier with high E. coli levels (Most Probable Number = 5.94*108), the average percent of E. coli in the feces that transferred to intact lettuce heads was 0.0267{\%} (Standard Error [SE] = 0.0172). Log-linear regression showed that significantly more E. coli transferred to outer leaves compared to inner leaves (Effect = 1.3; 95{\%} Confidence Interval = 0.4, 2.1). Additionally, the percent of E. coli that transferred from the feces to the lettuce decreased significantly with time after fecal placement, and as the distance between the lettuce and the feces, and the lettuce and the sprinklers increased. These findings provide key data that may be used in future quantitative risk assessments to identify potential intervention strategies for reducing food safety risks associated with fresh produce.},

abstract = {University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) has been an integral part of California's agriculture, with over a hundred years of research and outreach programs focused towards enhancement of agricultural productivity and water use efficiency. There has been a growing debate among policy makers and bureaucrats around provision of funding in cooperative extension and other federally funded research in agriculture, and possible privatization of the same. With this in mind this dissertation analyzes the impact of UCCE in three areas—creation and dissemination of research-based knowledge aimed at improving agricultural productivity, value of county level agricultural sales, and irrigation water use efficiency. The first analysis involves empirical analysis of the relationship between UCCE's investments in researchers and non-research provisions including infrastructure, and knowledge production. For capturing knowledge production, a knowledge index is created to incorporate knowledge produced and disseminated by UCCE via an array of different outreach methods. The second analysis involves the estimation of the impact of the knowledge stock created by UCCE through current and lagged expenditures in research and outreach programs at the county level. The analysis makes the hypothesis that current value of agricultural production is impacted by a knowledge stock which is composed by current and older expenditures made by UCCE on research and outreach programs. The knowledge stock enters the estimation function as a sum of current and depreciated value of older expenditures. Estimation results indicate that knowledge stock comprised of current and 5 lagged expenditure variables has a positive impact on current value of agricultural output, thereby providing evidence of a long term impact of current expenditures on future production at the county level. We estimate a net positive benefit accrued to county agricultural production value in the long run. The final analysis estimates the impact of UCCE's irrigation information on farm level value of average agricultural output per irrigated acre, as well as water use per irrigated acre. The study provides evidence of positive effect of UCCE, on both the outcome variables, and a net positive benefit to an average farm. There is an indication of trade-off between water use and revenue maximization, where users of UCCE irrigation information use more water, but produce higher output. Results provide important policy implications in relation to farmer adoption of water-saving technology prescribed by UCCE, irrigation efficient production and actual water use.},

abstract = {Essay 1–Efficiency and water use: Dynamic effects of irrigation technology adoption: With the United States preparing to make a historic investment in drought mitigation, clarifying the impact of irrigation efficiency improvements on water resources is critically important. This paper uses three transitions in irrigation technology to investigate whether rebound effects cause such efficiency improvements to increase resource extraction, a phenomenon known as Jevon's paradox. We demonstrate how staggered adoption of irrigation technologies and dynamic treatment effects can cause improperly specified two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimates to falsely indicate that technology adoption increases withdrawals. Using estimators appropriate for these circumstances, we find no significant evidence of rebound effects causing Jevon's paradox. The significant, dynamic effects we find explain this discrepancy and, perhaps more importantly, reveal irrigators' process of adaptation to each new technology at the intensive and extensive margins.Essay 2–Where will the United States farm carbon?: Geographic variation in the profitability and carbon sequestration potential of conservation agriculture practices will determine how cost-effective agricultural carbon credit programs are across the United States. As data on agricultural carbon credit program enrollment are unavailable, we use county-level data on the rate of adoption of conservation agriculture practices as a proxy for the profitability of the practices. We then map the predicted rates of adoption with spatially explicit carbon sequestration data for two practices and predict how the cost efficiency of agricultural carbon credit programs will vary spatially in the United States.Essay 3–Compensation mechanism, program scale, and the efficiency of voluntary carbon offset programs: In the present voluntary market for agricultural carbon credits, the fine scale nature of participation and evaluation can inhibit program administrators' efforts to predict producers' counterfactual behavior in the absence of a program and mitigate adverse selection. In addition, the uncertainty in estimates of soil carbon sequestration, the outcome used to issue carbon credits, increases rapidly as the scale of analysis decreases. Scaling up carbon farming programs to a jurisdiction level could address these issues by reducing uncertainty in both estimates, increasing the efficiency of achieving societal carbon sequestration goals. In such a jurisdictional approach to carbon farming programs, the program provides payments to jurisdictions based on the aggregate outcome of all producers within a jurisdiction. In this paper, we use a simulation approach to investigate the success of carbon farming programs with two different compensation mechanisms as a function of the program scale and design. When operating at the individual scale, we find programs using a per unit payment-for-sequestration approach are more efficient than those using a constant payment-per-practice mechanism only if the program administrator can estimate producers' carbon sequestration potential with sufficient accuracy. As the uncertainty in carbon sequestration rises, the payment-for-practice program becomes more efficient in terms of the average cost of an additional unit sequestered. Finally, increasing the scale of the program improves the efficiency of the payment-for-practice program to a greater degree such that it can be more efficient than the alternative, even if the error in estimating carbon sequestration is low.},

abstract = {Estimating the conveyance efficiency of traditional irrigation schemes systems is very important. It is because of understanding the volume of water lost along with the transportation facility, enhancing water usage and productivity, hence making better decisions about the utilization of water resources. The objective of the study was to determine water abstraction permit compliances and estimate conveyance efficiency and crop and water productivity of traditional irrigation systems in northern Tanzania. The task involved measurement of irrigation water flows to determine the amount of water abstraction, inflow (head) and outflow (tail) between the canals to determine the conveyance efficiency of the main, secondary, and tertiary canals of the traditional irrigation systems. Moreover, water and yield obtained at the farm level were determined. Results indicate that approximately 72{\%} of water transported reaches the destined farm which produced maize (Zea mays L) yields of 1054.5 kg/ha, 892.4 kg/ha, and 875.156 kg/ha at downstream, midstream, and upstream which equals 0.41 kg/m3, 0.15 kg/m3, and 0.09 kg/m3, respectively, while about 28{\%} of water is lost along the canals through evaporation, seepage, and deep percolation and overtopping. Consequently, water measured at furrow intakes in total was 3,500 L/s, equal to 23{\%} more than the permitted amount of 2856.14 L/s at Usa River Catchment. Interventions to minimize water losses starting at the furrow's intakes are urgently required in the current trend of the increasing demand for water resources for food production and schemes performance. Subsequently, more effective conveyance technologies and water management strategies other than canal lining are required.},

abstract = {Estimation of irrigation water use (IWU) is critical to assessing water use efficiency and optimizing water resource allocation. However, diversity in irrigation scheduling, irrigation system, and crop type has imposed restrictions on deriving the accurate spatial distribution of IWU. Existing approaches of deriving IWU may have large uncertainty, due mostly to methodological limitations, inadequate inputs, and the mismatch in spatiotemporal scale between IWU estimates and in situ counterparts. Remote sensing has the potential to provide valuable information on moisture transport, which could unravel water consumption by crops. First, we developed a robust relationship between root zone soil moisture (RZSM) and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to reference ET from the land components of European ReAnalysis‐5 (ERA5L) without an irrigation module across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Second, RZSM under irrigation was derived from the developed relationship and remotely sensed ETa from the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model during 2000–2020. Third, IWU over the two decades was derived based on increases in RZSM and ETa due to irrigation using remotely sensed and model‐based variables, along with our derived formulas considering groundwater recharge originating from irrigation. The IWU estimates were fairly reliable compared with reported IWU from the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey at the state‐level in four years, with the coefficient of determination ranging from 0.74 to 0.84, root mean square error ranging from 1.90 to 2.33 km3/yr, and bias ranging from −0.11 to 0.15 km3/yr. Integration of remotely sensed ETa with ERA5L output resulted in IWU estimates of much higher accuracy than published studies. The IWU estimates across the CONUS reflected an increasing trend (∼2.71 km3/yr2) during 2000–2007 but a decreasing trend (∼0.90 km3/yr2) during 2008–2020, due to efficient irrigation practices and increased precipitation.Alternate abstract:Plain Language SummaryIrrigation water use (IWU) applied by farmers or districts to alleviate crop water stress, is particularly important to assess water use efficiency and to optimize water resources allocation. There have been many studies that proposed approaches to derive IWU that is, however, subject to large uncertainty due to methodological limitations and/or inadequate data input. Remote sensing could provide valuable information on moisture transport induced by climate variability and human intervention, which has the potential to address restrictions on deriving accurate IWU. A novel IWU estimation approach jointly using remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (ET), modeled root zone soil moisture and actual ET from land components of European ReAnalysis‐5 without an irrigation module, and irrigated area fraction was developed to generate IWU over the contiguous United States (CONUS) during 2000–2020. IWU estimates from the developed approach were evaluated against reported IWU at the state‐level in four years, with accuracy comparable to or higher than existing studies/approaches. Spatially averaged annual IWU estimates in the CONUS increased by 2.71 km3/yr2 during 2000‐2007 but decreased by 0.90 km3/yr2 during 2008–2020. This study has important implications for agricultural management over the CONUS and could be applicable to similar regions globally whose agriculture depends heavily on irrigation.},

A comparison experiment was carried out between parental inbred lines and diallel and reciprocal hybrids using the RCBD design in split-plot arrangement with three replications. Where the irrigation intervals 6 and 12 days allocated to the main plots, and genotypes (inbred lines and hybrids) allocated to the sub plots in order to estimate the general and specific combining ability of the studied traits. The results of the study indicated that there were significant differences between the parental inbred lines and their diallel and reciprocal hybrids in the general and specific combining abilities and their effects for most of the studied traits. The inbred ZM4 gave the highest negative combining ability to female flowering, which was −0.77 and −1.06 for 6 and 12-day irrigation intervals, respectively. While the MH121 inbred line with 6-day irrigation interval and ZM4 inbred line with 12-day irrigation interval were distinguished by giving it the highest positive and significant combining ability of grain yield, which amounted to 4.78 and 9.45, respectively. The specific combining ability of the hybrids was characterized by negative and positive values, the cross-hybrid AG116 × AGM20 with the irrigation interval of 6 days gave the highest positive and significant combining ability of 34.05. While the hybrid MH17 × ZM4 with an irrigation interval of 12 days was distinguished by giving it a positive combining ability of 7.12. As for the reciprocal hybrids, the reciprocal hybrid MH121 × AG116 with irrigation intervals of 6 and 12 days gave the highest positive and significant values of 48.74 and 25.76, respectively. The percentage of heritability in the broad sense was 99.8{\%} in the leaf area of the 6-day irrigation interval, while with the 12-day irrigation interval it was 98.76{\%} in the female flowering trait. Whereas, the percentages of heritability in the narrow sense reached 78{\%} in the number of rows in ear with the irrigation interval of 6 days for the reciprocal hybrids, while it reached 78.91 in the reciprocal hybrids at the 12-day irrigation interval for female flowering.},

abstract = {The need for the appreciation of values and knowledge diversity has contributed to the increasing relevance of stakeholder participation in the monitoring and evaluation (M{\&}E) of development projects. Using mixed methods research design and indicators, this paper assesses the outcomes of the participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME) process of the Tada Shonga Irrigation Project, Kwara State, Nigeria. A total of 103 respondents were randomly selected for questionnaire administration, and 5 respondents interviewed for the study. An Outcome Perception Index (OPI) was developed to assess stakeholders' perception of the extent to which the project had met its objectives. The study found out that the project's PME process was deficient, and the outcomes of the project and its PME process had been a mixed bag. The study further established a significant relationship between the deficient PME process of the project and project outcomes, although the relationship is indicative, rather than proof of a possible causal relationship. This was corroborated by the qualitative analysis which highlighted other critical factors affecting project outcomes. The study concluded that stringent M{\&}E framework must be imbued in government policies to ensure success and sustainability of projects and programmes.

abstract = {Interventions that aim to increase water availability for agriculture hold great potential for improving nutrition through increasing food production, generating income, enhancing water access and sanitation and hygiene conditions, and through strengthening women's empowerment. Yet there is scarce evidence on the linkages between small-scale irrigation and the pathways through which nutrition outcomes can be achieved. Using data from a cross-sectional household survey collected in Ethiopia and Tanzania, we explored the potential for small-scale irrigation to contribute to improved diets, and identify the pathways through which irrigation affects dietary diversity as measured by the Household Dietary Diversity Score. Unadjusted comparisons show that irrigating households in both countries produced more vegetables, fruits and cash crops, are less food insecure, have a higher value of production, and have higher production diversity and dietary diversity compared to non-irrigating households. Econometric results of a simultaneous equation (3SLS) model showed that irrigation leads to better household dietary diversity mainly through the pathway of increasing household incomes. However, these results are statistically significant only in the case of Ethiopia, and not in Tanzania. While irrigation increased production diversity in Ethiopia, the benefits of increased dietary diversity cannot be attributed to these changes in production after controlling for the effect of income. Other factors, such as gender of the household head and having off-farm income, also influence dietary diversity in Ethiopia. These findings suggest that the potential for irrigation to influence diets is highly context-specific. Understanding the particular pathways and entry points for nutrition-sensitive agriculture approaches could help to improve their benefits for nutrition.},

abstract = {Improving the management of irrigation schemes is a priority in the Mediterranean countries of the EU to achieve the objectives of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60EC. In the case of schemes based on open-channel networks for water conveyance and delivery, a limitation to the management efficiency is the huge number of gates that need to be controlled and regulated manually to adapt the flow to the actual irrigation water demand. Automated and coordinated gate regulation of large irrigation schemes has been successfully implemented in some areas of the world (e.g., NSW, Australia), but it implies huge public investments that are often unavailable. Opposite to this top–down approach, the Lombardy region (the largest irrigated region in the EU) has explored an approach based on funding small projects, which should demonstrate the potential of innovation in irrigation practice and foster the expansion of the most effective measures. In this paper, we analyze the effects of one of these projects, consisting in the substitution of a manual gate, controlling the supply of irrigation to a 150 ha irrigation district, with an automated, remotely controlled gate. Nine years of daily flow measurements at the district inlet, provided by the irrigation consortium that manages the gate, were compared with the rigid flow regulation that was applied when the inlet gate was manually regulated and with the irrigation water requirements simulated with a distributed agro-hydrological model widely used in the region for irrigation accounting and planning. The results show that the flexible regulation allowed by the new gate provided an average water saving of 12,000 m³/ha/year compared to the rigid regulation system. A further, though smaller, margin of improvement of 5000 m³/ha/year can be achieved with an optimal regulation that follows exactly the crop water requirements. A further interesting empirical evidence is that the simulation model fits very well the irrigation water requirements of the district using only easily accessible meteorological input data, without exploiting any information from ground or remote sensors to update soil moisture or crop developments during the season. This indicates that it could be effectively used, with very limited costs and effort, to support and improve the gate management. Finally, a preliminary economic analysis shows that the cost of the gate installation is sustainable, but the upscaling of this type of intervention to larger areas requires the support of public funding to cover approximately half of the cost of investment needed for the networking infrastructures.},

abstract = {Improving the management of irrigation schemes is a priority in the Mediterranean countries of the EU to achieve the objectives of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60EC. In the case of schemes based on open-channel networks for water conveyance and delivery, a limitation to the management efficiency is the huge number of gates that need to be controlled and regulated manually to adapt the flow to the actual irrigation water demand. Automated and coordinated gate regulation of large irrigation schemes has been successfully implemented in some areas of the world (e.g., NSW, Australia), but it implies huge public investments that are often unavailable. Opposite to this top–down approach, the Lombardy region (the largest irrigated region in the EU) has explored an approach based on funding small projects, which should demonstrate the potential of innovation in irrigation practice and foster the expansion of the most effective measures. In this paper, we analyze the effects of one of these projects, consisting in the substitution of a manual gate, controlling the supply of irrigation to a 150 ha irrigation district, with an automated, remotely controlled gate. Nine years of daily flow measurements at the district inlet, provided by the irrigation consortium that manages the gate, were compared with the rigid flow regulation that was applied when the inlet gate was manually regulated and with the irrigation water requirements simulated with a distributed agro-hydrological model widely used in the region for irrigation accounting and planning. The results show that the flexible regulation allowed by the new gate provided an average water saving of 12,000 m3/ha/year compared to the rigid regulation system. A further, though smaller, margin of improvement of 5000 m3/ha/year can be achieved with an optimal regulation that follows exactly the crop water requirements. A further interesting empirical evidence is that the simulation model fits very well the irrigation water requirements of the district using only easily accessible meteorological input data, without exploiting any information from ground or remote sensors to update soil moisture or crop developments during the season. This indicates that it could be effectively used, with very limited costs and effort, to support and improve the gate management.

abstract = {One of the most important simulation models in the field of water
produc{\{}''{\}}tivity (WP) management in the world is the Aquacrop model,
which depends on many factors and conditions related to climate, soil,
irrigation water, etc. Aquacrop model program simulates vegetative
growth and the yield of both grains, biomass and irrigation WP. The
purpose of this study is to evaluate the Aquacrop model of two Egyptian
wheat varieties, Gemeza-9 (G-9) and Misr-1 (M-1), under the two modern
irrigation systems, sprinkler and drip, and the application of algae
solution. Experiment location of fieldwork for this research was in
El-Nubaria area, El-Beheira Governorate, and Aquacrop in Egypt. Results
obtained show that under both irrigation systems, the deviation
percentages between simulated by Aquacrop and observed WP values were
40.6{\%} and 68.34{\%}, in the case of using untreated algae and treated
algae, respectively. From LSD 0.05{\%} values, there are significant
differences between all study factors (irrigation system, wheat
varieties, and applied algae). Moreover, the interactions between all
factors were significant under wheat grain yield of two varieties but no
significant differences were found under observed or simulated WP by the
Aquacrop model. It can be concluded that it is possible to recommend to
use the Aquacrop simulation model for different wheat varieties in the
future, to predict the WP in these semi-arid areas, especially under
different irrigation systems (Bradford and Hsiao 1982; Entz et al. 1992;

abstract = {Methods to estimate irrigation withdrawal using nationally available datasets and techniques that are transferable to other agricultural regions were evaluated by the U.S. Geological Survey as part of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin focus area study of the National Water Census (ACF-FAS). These methods investigated the spatial, temporal, and quantitative distributions of water withdrawal for irrigation in the southwestern Georgia region of the ACF-FAS, filling a vital need to inform science-based decisions regarding resource management and conservation. The crop- demand method assumed that only enough water is pumped onto a crop to satisfy the deficit between evapotranspiration and precipitation. A second method applied a geostatistical regimen of variography and conditional simulation to monthly metered irrigation withdrawal to estimate irrigation withdrawal where data do not exist. A third method analyzed Landsat satellite imagery using an automated approach to generate monthly estimates of irrigated lands. These methods were evaluated independently and compared collectively with measured water withdrawal information available in the Georgia part of the ACF-FAS, principally in the Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin. An assessment of each method's contribution to the National Water Census program was also made to identify transfer value of the methods to the national program and other water census studies. None of the three methods evaluated represent a turnkey process to estimate irrigation withdrawal on any spatial (local or regional) or temporal (monthly or annual) extent. Each method requires additional information on agricultural practices during the growing season to complete the withdrawal estimation process. Spatial and temporal limitations inherent in identifying irrigated acres during the growing season, and in designing spatially and temporally representative monitor (meter) networks, can belie the ability of the methods to produce accurate irrigation-withdrawal estimates that can be used to produce dependable and consistent assessments of water availability and use for the National Water Census. Emerging satellite-data products and techniques for data analysis can generate high spatial-resolution estimates of irrigated-acres distributions with near-term temporal frequencies compatible with the needs of the ACF-FAS and the National Water Census.},

abstract = {The qualitative parameters of development of a quantitatively increasing population for a resource stressed country like India, is dependent on the sustainability of food availability. Agriculture remains to be a backbone of the economy and food supply. Agriculture, however, in many parts of India, even today, remains to be rain-fed. Recent efforts at the government level, Centre and State, have helped to bring a significant amount of land, initially under rain-fed agriculture, to under irrigation of various types. These varied types of irrigation change regionally; on various agro-factors. Source of water resources to be used for irrigation in the respective climatic sub-regions and the subsequent crop cultivated in the respective region are just a few primary factors controlling the effectivity of the type of irrigation method used. Irrigation requires technological inputs, which, in turn, requires financial expenses that need to be under the significant agro-factors mentioned above. Governments at the Centre and State levels; have been continuously making efforts to support irrigation practices through direct and indirect supportive schemes. These schemes have their positive, and at times, negative impact on the local agriculture at a micro-level. Agriculture is a state subject in India. The Centre does provide finance for various agricultural projects as well. Micro-irrigation has been and will play an essential role in the future in India. Ever since 1992, the government has been taking initiatives in micro-irrigation. These have eventually transpired into schemes, i.e., Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) in 2006, later upgraded to the National Mission on Micro Irrigation (NMMI) implemented since 2013-14 and subsequently National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture. The present study is an attempt to evaluate such 'State' (Central and State Governments)sponsored irrigation programs on agricultural practices at a micro level, over a decade (2005-2016). The study area identified for the same is a tahsil in the Ahmednagar district of Western Maharashtra. What is significant is that, the said tahsil Shrigonda; lies in the drought-prone region and that there have been cyclic variations in the rainfall, and the various agriculture crops cultivated through the last decade. State Government-sponsored schemes are seen to have been blended with Central Government schemes by the local farmers to achieve sustainability of crops. The effects of the same, on the cycle of products, is worth an observation.Human factors also play an equally important role while using the developing Technology of micro-irrigation. Farmers try-and-test various crops with the respective Micro-irrigation technique, in the respective agro-climatic regions, particularly when the source of water is not assured in the drought-prone area. Subsequent allied government schemes (farm ponds), the market value of the product, and perishability or shelf-life of the products also play a significant role in the choice of crop. The success of the micro-irrigation schemes will, however, be dependent on the effective delivery mechanism through close coordination among all the tiers of government and capacity building of beneficiaries.},

abstract = {Continuous monitoring of soil moisture content within and below the rooting zone can facilitate optimal irrigation scheduling aimed at minimizing both the effects of water stress on the plants, and also the leaching of water below the root zone, which can have adverse environmental effects. The use of Sentek capacitance probes (EnviroSCAN RT5) in scheduling citrus irrigation was evaluated using 3-year-old Hamlin orange trees [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.] on Swingle citrumelo rootstock [Citrus paradisi Macf. Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] grown in a Candler fine sand (hyperthermic, uncoated, Typic Quartzipsamments). Available soil moisture calculated according to capacitance probe readings of soil moisture agreed well with that calculated using soil water release curves determined in the laboratory. A utility program was developed to process the data collected by the capacitance probe into a spreadsheet format. Processed data were used to calculate soil water storage within and below the citrus root zone at desired time intervals. Irrigation set points (i.e., full point equivalent to maximum desirable water storage and refill points I and II) were defined based on field capacity determined both in the field and in the laboratory and permanent wilting point. It was possible to maintain the water content in the root zone between the full and refill points I and II during most of the growing season. Although soil water content in the root zone exceeded the full point during periods of high irrigation, it drained rapidly within 24-48 h after the end of such irrigation events. Using soil moisture depletion in the root zone during periods of low water application to estimate citrus evapotranspiration (ET), the calculated daily average ET during 10-day period in November was 1.33 mm day super(-1).},

abstract = {Importance Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (eCRS), contemporarily classified as diffuse type 2 dominant chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), is characterized by eosinophil-dominant mucosal inflammation. Contemporary management of eCRS as an inflammatory airway condition is multimodal with corticosteroid irrigations after the surgical creation of a neosinus cavity. Objectives To assess long-term treatment outcomes in patients with primary diffuse type 2 CRS or eCRS receiving multimodal treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective cohort study of patients seen in a tertiary rhinology practice recruited from May 2010 to November 2018 was conducted. Follow-up duration was 12 months or more following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) with a neosinus cavity formed. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Consecutive adult (≥18 years) patients diagnosed with primary diffuse type 2 dominant CRS or eCRS based on the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020 criteria were included. Type 2 inflammation was defined as more than 10 eosinophils per high-power field obtained from sinus mucosal biopsy and managed with neosinus cavity ESS and ongoing corticosteroid irrigations. Exclusion criteria were less than 12 months of follow-up and secondary CRS. Interventions Endoscopic sinus surgery with complete removal of intersinus bony partitions to create a neosinus cavity. Nasal irrigation (240 mL) with betamethasone, 1 mg, or budesonide, 1 mg, daily for 3 to 6 months after ESS and tapered to an as-needed basis (minimum, 2-3 per week). Main Outcomes and Measures Poor control was defined as polyp recurrence (polyp growth in {\textgreater}1 sinus area on a single side), use of long-term systemic therapy (biologic therapy or ≥3 consecutive months of oral corticosteroids), and revision surgery involving polypectomy. The disease in patients with no poor control criteria was defined as well controlled, and the disease in those with 1 or more criteria was considered poorly controlled. Maintenance medical therapy use and patient-reported outcomes based on the 22-item Sinonasal Outcomes Test for preoperative and last follow-up were collected. Results Of the 222 participants recruited with primary diffuse type 2 dominant CRS or eCRS and minimum of year of follow-up, 126 were men (56.8{\%}). Mean (SD) age was 54.8 (13.6) years, and median (SD) follow-up was 2.2 (2.2) years. Of the 222 patients, 195 (87.8{\%}) had well-controlled disease, 16 (7.2{\%}) had polyp recurrence, 7 (3.2{\%}) continued to receive long-term oral corticosteroid therapy, 5 (2.3{\%}) received biologic therapy, and 8 (3.6{\%}) underwent a revision polypectomy. Clinically meaningful change on the 22-item Sinonasal Outcomes Test and the nasal subdomain score was maintained at the last follow-up in 134 patients (67.0{\%}). Poor disease control was not associated with poor adherence to irrigation use. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that long-term disease control and reduction in symptom burden in patients with primary diffuse type 2 CRS or eCRS might be achieved when managed as an inflammatory disorder. Maintenance corticosteroid irrigations in the population examined appeared to be successfully self-tapered to disease activity.},

abstract = {The Moroccan Ministry of Public Health has launched a programme to eliminate schistosomiasis. One of the components in this process is the control of Bulinus truncatus, the intermediate host snail of Schistosoma haematobium. We evaluated three environmentally safe measures to control B. truncatus in siphon boxes, the main breeding sites for these snails in the Tessaout Amont irrigation system. The first method involved covering the siphon boxes to exclude light and reduce algal growth, the second consisted of increasing the frequency of emptying and cleaning the siphon boxes, and the third method increased water velocity to hinder the establishment of the intermediate hosts. The results showed that covering had a pronounced effect on snail and egg mass density, was accepted by the local community and prevented water contact. Cleaning the siphons three times during the irrigation season led to a reduction in snail density although it was not statistically significant and recolonization was rapid. Increasing water velocity by reducing the dimensions of siphon boxes delayed recolonization, but such a control measure can be applied only in specific situations where it does not pose hydraulic problems. The three interventions were selectively effective against B. truncatus, whereas other snails such as Physa acuta and Lymnaea peregra were hardly affected. Covering, the most promising control measure, could be useful in the Moroccan schistosomiasis eradication programme. However, further investigations are needed to assess its impact on water quality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDChemical control is the most used and effective method to control Diaphorina citri, the vector of the phloem-limited bacteria associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB) disease. The objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of flupyradifurone applied via dripping irrigation systems on D. citri. Bioassays were conducted using leaves harvested on various dates post treatment, and insecticide residue in leaf tissue was quantified.RESULTSThe drip application of flupyradifurone on citrus trees provided high-level and long-term control against D. citri adult, and the median lethal concentration (LC50 ) for ingestion of flupyradifurone in D. citri was 22.22 mg kg-1 (fresh leaf). Flupyradifurone residue was detected in leaf tissue within 3 days after treatment. The measured level of flupyradifurone peaked on day 40 day after application, and then showed a steady decline in subsequent days for all three applied dosages. The amounts of flupyradifurone in upper, middle, and lower leaves were similar, and trends in the change in concentration of flupyradifurone were consistent.CONCLUSIONSThe results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can be a valuable new tool for D. citri management programs, and drip-applied flupyradifurone provides an extended period of control efficacy. This paper could provide a reference to reduce the dependence on foliar-applied insecticides, with associated benefits for non-target exposure to workers and pollinators. {\textcopyright} 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {Intensive agriculture by indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, sewage water, and polluted drain water has posed a serious threat to groundwater quality in some peri-urban areas of Delhi like Najafgarh block. The objective of the study was to determine the groundwater quality and to map their spatial variation in terms of suitability for irrigation and drinking purpose. Ordinary kriging method was used for preparation of thematic maps of groundwater quality parameters such as electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, bicarbonate, magnesium/calcium ratio, total dissolved solids, chloride, nitrate and hardness. Exponential semivariogram model was best fitted for all quality parameters except chloride and hardness, where spherical model fitted best. Pollution level was highest at south and south-eastern part of the study area. Better quality groundwater may be expected at the northern and western part. High salinity was due to high chloride concentration in the groundwater. Nitrate pollution level was found to be very alarming and need immediate interventions. High dissolved solids and hardness made the groundwater unsuitable for drinking. There were negligible sodium and bicarbonate hazard in the study area. The groundwater quality index was devised to analyse the combined impact of different quality parameters on irrigation and drinking purposes. The irrigation water quality index and drinking water quality index distribution maps delineated an area of 47.29 and 6.54 km2 suitable for irrigation and drinking, respectively. These safe zones were found as a small strip along the northern boundary and a very small pocket at the western side of the study area.},

abstract = {In the era of extreme weather events, plant resistance to excessive water should be considered for plantations in frequently flooded areas to ensure their maximum survival and conservation of natural habitats. Therefore, we quantified the resistance to excessive irrigation (REI) in seedlings of six conifer species on the basis of their morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits. Two different irrigation regimes, natural precipitation as a control treatment and additional irrigation by sprinklers (30.89 ± 2.80{\%} above natural precipitation) as excessive irrigation, were applied for three consecutive years. The changes in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits under long-term excessive irrigation were species-specific. There were three distinct responses in biomass accumulation: drought-susceptible Chamaecyparis obtusa and Abies holophylla significantly increased their aboveground and underground biomass and showed a strong REI; Pinus thunbergii and P. densiflora, both resistant to drought, significantly decreased their aboveground and underground biomass and showed a weak REI. Larix kaempferi and Pinus koraiensis showed a medium REI with only aboveground biomass increment in the former and no biomass change in the latter. Plant biomass responses corresponded well with the changes in morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits. Biomass augmentation resulted from an increase in leaf size, leaf mass per area (LMA), maximum photosynthesis rate, and leaf water potential. Flavonoids, LMA, and stomatal conductance are the most important traits to assess species REI. This study elucidates plant responses to excess water and traits that drive their tolerance. The findings will help in the selection of species for flood-tolerant afforestation programs and establishment of sustainable forests in regions with increased frequency and severity of excessive rainfall.},

abstract = {Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) is the source of the Klamath River that flows through southern Oregon and northern California. The UKL Basin provides water for 81,000+ ha (200,000+ acres) of irrigation on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Klamath Project located downstream of the UKL Basin. Irrigated agriculture also occurs along the tributaries to UKL. During 2013–2016, water rights calls resulted in various levels of curtailment of irrigation diversions from the tributaries to UKL. However, information on the extent of curtailment, how much irrigation water was saved, and its impact on the UKL is unknown. In this study, we combined Landsat‐based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data obtained from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model with gridded precipitation and U.S. Geological Survey station discharge data to evaluate the hydrologic impact of the curtailment program. Analysis was performed for 2004, 2006, 2008–2010 (base years), and 2013–2016 (target years) over irrigated areas above UKL. Our results indicate that the savings from the curtailment program over the June to September time period were highest during 2013 and declined in each of the following years. The total on‐field water savings was approximately 60 hm3 in 2013 and 2014, 44 hm3 in 2015, and 32 hm3 in 2016 (1 hm3 = 10,000 m3 or 810.7 ac‐ft). The instream water flow changes or extra water available were 92, 68, 45, and 26 hm3, respectively, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Highest water savings came from pasture and wetlands. Alfalfa showed the most decline in water use among grain crops. The resulting extra water available from the curtailment contributed to a maximum of 19{\%} of the lake inflows and 50{\%} of the lake volume. The Landsat‐based ETa and other remote sensing datasets used in this study can be used to monitor crop water use at the irrigation district scale and to quantify water savings as a result of land‐water management changes.},

@phdthesis{Chlapecka2021,
abstract = {As water resources gain value across the Mid-South, alternative irrigation strategies of rice (Oryza sativa L.) have garnered increasing attention. In 2015, an estimated 1.7{\%} of Arkansas rice hectarage used alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation and 0.9{\%} used furrow irrigation. As of 2020, 2.5{\%} used AWD and 16.9{\%} used furrow irrigation, the latter accounting for near 99,000 ha in Arkansas. Little information exists in the scientific literature in relation to management of rice grown in the Mid-South without a conventional flood. This fact coupled with the rapid adoption rate, especially for furrow-irrigated rice (FIR), during the last five years prompted the need for additional scientific information. Studies were initiated from 2018 through 2020 to examine several management differences under alternative irrigation strategies, including irrigation timing, fertilizer-nitrogen (N) management, and nutrient uptake surveys. Large block trials were conducted in 2018 and 2019 to assess the proper irrigation timing for AWD and FIR at a total of four site-years per irrigation method. Small-plot trials were conducted in the top (aerobic) and bottom (generally flooded, anaerobic) of FIR fields from 2018 to 2020 at thirteen sites to determine the optimum N management program for FIR on clayey and silt loam soils. From these small-plot trials, aboveground biomass samples were taken at R3 (50{\%} heading) to analyze the nutrient uptake including N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), and eight other plant-essential nutrients. Results indicate that AWD and FIR can be allowed to dry to at least –45 kPa in the upper third of the field at depth of 10 cm prior to each irrigation event. The optimal N program for FIR on clayey soils was a three-way split application, which included an additional 52 kg N ha–1 over the recommended season total N rate for flooded rice production, but further economic analysis is certainly needed. While this program also maximized rice grain and milling yield on a silt loam soil, it appears that the extra 52 kg N ha–1 may not be needed and that more management options may be possible to optimize FIR production on a silt loam soil. However, it appears that there is no need to manage the top and bottom of the field separately in terms of N management. Nutrient uptake surveys from sites on both clayey and silt loam soil textures suggest that P and K uptake are much less at the top of the field, where aerobic conditions generally exist throughout the season. Thus, it may be necessary to focus on P and K management in FIR in the future and amended management recommendations may be advised. Through the studies conducted as a part of this project, it has been shown that AWD and FIR production are viable methods for growing rice in the Mid-South. The management aspects examined in the current studies should allow rice producers considering AWD, and especially FIR, to maximize rice grain yield and milling yield while minimizing the potential negative environmental impact associated with the transition to these alternative methods of rice irrigation.},

abstract = {Rice is an important cereal crop in Kenya, where it is mainly grown in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme, MIS. The serious challenges of MIS include low water use efficiency and limited available water resources. The objective of this study is to analyze the current and future irrigation water resource availability for the improvement of future water management. A Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a public domain software supported by the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service in Bushland, TX, USA, was used to estimate the current and future water resources availability from the MIS's main irrigation water supply sources (River Thiba and River Nyamindi). CropWat, a computer program developed by the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Rome, Italy, was used to estimate irrigation water requirements from 2013–2016 and into the future (2020–2060 and 2061–2099). Future climatic data for total available flow and irrigation requirement estimations were downloaded from three General Circulation Models (GCMs). The data was bias corrected and down-scaled (with observed data) using a Climate Change Toolkit, a toolkit for climate change analysis developed by the Water Weather and Energy Ecosystem, Zurich, Switzerland. The results indicated that the highest irrigation water deficits were experienced in July and August based on the existing cropping pattern. Under a proposed future pattern, estimates show that MIS will experience water deficits mainly from June to October and from January to February. This study recommends that MIS management should put into strong consideration the simulated future estimates in irrigation water availability for the improvement of water management.},

abstract = {Knowledge of soil infiltration parameters is of the utmost importance for optimum performance and management of surface irrigation. The advance of the surface flow across a field varies according to the infiltration rate, ultimately determining the soil moisture uniformity and water application efficiency. Calculation of the infiltration parameters from irrigation advance data is now the preferred method. If the process is to be included in a real- time control system it must be done accurately, reliably and rapidly, without user intervention, and with a minimum of field data. With this purpose in mind, six infiltration methods were selected for evaluation: the two-point method, the computer model INFILT, the method of Upadhyaya and Raghuwanshi, the Valiantaz one-point method, the Shepard one-point method and a simple linear infiltration function. Field experimental data from 10 furrow irrigation trials were used to evaluate the methods, these data covering a range of soil types and furrow characteristics. The data sets were analyzed to determine infiltration parameters to evaluate the ability of the selected methods for prediction of advance and cumulative infiltration. The results showed INFILT to be the most accurate and reliable method, performing consistently well for all of the data sets. Generally the two-point and linear estimation methods also performed well, although the two-point method is handicapped by its requirement for prior knowledge of the steady or final infiltration rate f sub(o). None of the methods proved entirely suitable for use in a real-time control system.Original Abstract: La connaissance des parametres d'infiltration des sols est primordiale pour l'execution et la gestion optimales de l'irrigation superficielle. La progression de l'ecoulement a travers un champ varie en fonction du taux d'infiltration qui par la suite determine le degre d'uniformite de l'humidite dans le sol, et l'utilisation efficace des ressources hydriques. de nos jours, il est preferable de calculer les parametres d'infiltration a partir les donnees obtenues de la progression de l'irrigation. Si le processus doit etre inclus dans un systeme de commande en temps reel, il doit etre execute d'une maniere fiable, exacte, rapide, sans intervention de l'utilisateur, et avec un minimum de donnees de champs. Tout en tenant compte de cet imperatif, six methodes d'infiltration ont ete choisies pour etre evaluees: la methode a deux points, le logiciel INFILT, la methode d'Upadhyaya et de Raghuwanshi, la methode a un point de Valiantaz, la methode a un point de Shepard, et finalement une simple fonction lineaire d'infiltration. Des donnees experimentales obtenues sur 10 essais d'irrigation de sillon ont ete employees pour evaluer les performances de ces methodes. Ces donnees couvrent une large gamme de types de sol et de caracteristiques de sillon. Elles ont ete analysees pour determiner les parametres d'infiltration, et eventuellement les capacites des methodes choisies a prevoir la progression et cumulation de l'infiltration. Les resultats obtenus ont montre que le logiciel INFILT est la methode la plus precise et la plus fiable, faisant preuve de consistance sur l'ensemble des donnees. D'une maniere generale la fonction lineaire d'infiltration et la methode a deux points s'executent relativement bien, sauf que cette derniere souffre d'un handicap vu qu'elle necessite la connaissance anterieure du taux d'infiltration stationnaire ou final: f sub(0). Cependant, aucune des methodes n'a prouve etre en mesure de satisfaire les exigences d'une utilisation par un systeme de commande en temps reel.},

abstract = {Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is among the oldest cultivated oilseed crops and is regarded as the “queen of oil seeds” because of its oil quality. Since sesame is cultivated in harsh environments, its seed yield is greatly affected by adverse conditions, such as drought. Therefore, we undertook a 2‐yr experiment to understand the effects of deficit irrigation on yield, yield components, oil percentage, water use efficiency, and stress indices of six sesame genotypes. The experiment was conducted at Seed and Plant Improvement Institute, Karaj, located in the semi‐arid region of Iran, during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Deficit irrigation was induced by irrigating after 80{\%} available water depletion, and irrigating after 40{\%} available water depletion was considered to be normal irrigation. Among the genotypes, Oltan and USA‐ns‐96 produced the maximum seed and oil yield. Stress indices analysis revealed that the Sudan‐94 genotype was the most tolerant to deficit irrigation, and the Dashtestan‐2 genotype was the most sensitive. In addition, the Sudan‐94, USA‐ns‐96, and Oltan genotypes showed the highest yield stability index and relative stress index. Regarding drought tolerance, the Sudan‐94 genotype performed the best with minimum reduction in seed yield and other agronomic traits. Overall, these results suggest that the Sudan‐94 genotype is the most drought‐tolerant genotype with the maximum yield stability. Moreover, this study highlights the possibility of using Sudan‐94 genotype in future breeding programs.},

@article{Conger2020a,
abstract = {Weather-based irrigation controllers (WBICs) are modern technologies designed to schedule irrigation applications with automatic in-ground irrigation systems based on plant water requirements. The Irrigation Association developed the Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) testing protocol as a pseudo standard for evaluating the scheduling abilities of these WBICs. SWAT test scores provide an estimate of irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency as measures of under- and over-irrigation, respectively. The EPA WaterSense Program adopted the SWAT test as part of its criteria for identifying water-efficient devices for consumer labeling. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the rigor of the SWAT test in terms of (1) reproducibility of the evaluation, (2) transferability of performance results when tested in a different climate, and (3) whether an hourly soil water balance that better reflects natural soil water movement would significantly alter performance results and improve the relationship between performance scores and water conservation potential. Both hourly and daily soil water balances were evaluated using data from a virtual test, modeled after original SWAT testing conditions, and a field test conducted in southwest Florida that evaluated the same brands of WBICs to assess water conservation potential against time-based schedules. During the exploratory process, it was determined that the SWAT test was not independently reproducible due to deficiencies in protocol documentation, controller setup and programming procedures, order of operations, and weather data availability. In the virtual test, both irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency increased by as much as 11.8 and 9.6 percentage points, respectively, for the hourly model compared to the daily model for each WBIC. Scheduling efficiency scores from the field test declined by as much as 12.9 percentage points when switching to the hourly model, with almost perfect irrigation adequacy in every season. These results indicate over-irrigation by WBICs in practice, with few instances when scores met the minimum criteria for achieving a label by WaterSense. Over-irrigation by WBICs in the field test was partially attributed to the inability to effectively incorporate rainfall into scheduling decisions. The dichotomy in the results of these two datasets highlights deficiencies in the transferability of results. Intermittent rainfall created transitional periods, both before and after the rain event, when the controller must make smart decisions and should be included in any evaluation of a smart controller. Additionally, the connection between water conservation potential and performance results must be explored in more depth.},

abstract = {Afghanistan has an arid to semi-arid climate where irrigated agriculture largely depends on scarce irrigation water supplies from snowmelt from the high raised mountains. Under growing water scarcity, farmers not only need to use the available water more wisely but have to develop alternative options for coping water scarcity. Deficit irrigation schedule can be one of the options to mitigate the adverse impacts of water scarcity on crop production. In the current study, FAO's crop water productivity model (AquaCrop) was calibrated and validated with field data in Kabul River Basin (KRB) for wheat crop to simulate four different water scarcity scenarios (S-A: business-as-usual scenario, S-B: refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 {\%} water depletion, S-C: refilling the soil profile upon 100 {\%} depletion and S-D: refilling the soil profile upon 130 {\%} depletion occurrence) for resultant yield, water productivity (WP) and biomass production. Two wheat fields, namely A and B were monitored intensively for soil moisture content, meteorological situation, irrigation application and post-harvest data. Results show that the measured WP was 1.4 kg m−3 ETa and 1.5 kg m−3 ETa whereas, the actual (measured) water use efficiency (WUE) was 0.58 kg m−3 and 0.66 kg m−3 for Field A and Field B, respectively. The WP of the scenarios S-A, S-B, S-C and S-D was 2.0-2.1 kg m−3 ETa (for plot B and A), 2.5 kg m−3 ETa, 2.74 kg m−3 ETa and 2.8 kg m−3 ETa respectively. Similarly, yield under these scenarios was 6.4 ton ha−1, 8.7 ton ha−1, 7.4 ton ha−1and 6.7 ton ha−1 respectively while the above ground biomass was 21.3 ton ha−1, 21.8 ton ha−1, 19 ton ha−1 and 18.3 ton ha−1 respectively. As a consequence, WP could increase by 92.8 {\%}, 78 {\%} and 95 {\%} in S-B, S-C and S-D, respectively with reference to the measured WP. The optimized scenarios developed in this study can provide guidelines for policy makers and farming communities to mitigate the adverse impact of water scarcity through such innovative interventions.},

abstract = {Objective:  This study aimed to evaluate the combined effectiveness of 2{\%} chlorhexidine (CHX) and passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) biofilm. Materials and Methods: The root canals of 66 single-rooted extracted human mandibular premolar teeth (n=66) were enlarged up to a size of 40/0.06 taper and autoclaved. Fifty-nine roots were inoculated with E. faecalis and incubated for 4 weeks, whereas 7 roots served as the negative control group and were filled with sterile brain heart infusion broth. The remaining specimens (n=59) were assigned into 4 experimental groups (n=13) and a positive control group (n=7): CHX via standard needle irrigation (SNI), sodium hypochloride (NaOCl) via SNI, CHX via PUI, NaOCl via PUI and non-treated positive controls. Bacteriological samples were collected before and after the intervention, and microbiological analysis was performed by counting the colony forming units. Reduction in colony count (RCC) between before and after the intervention in each group were compared using One-Way ANOVA. Results: The highest RCC was determined in NaOCl/PUI and the lowest in CHX/SNI (p{\textless}0.05). Regarding RCC, CHX/PUI showed statistically similar results with NaOCl/ PUI and NaOCl/SNI (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: A PUI of 2{\%} CHX induced a statistically similar amount of RCC with both a PUI of 2.5{\%} NaOCl and SNI of 2.5{\%} NaOCl. PUI combined with 2{\%} CHX can be used in secondary endodontic infections and during routine endodontic treatment due to increased antibacterial efficiency against E. faecalis.},

abstract = {Iraq has a subtropical semi-arid climate; it was previously considered to be rich in water, but for several reasons, including climate change and dam construction by neighbouring countries, a shortage of water resources has developed in recent years. Using the drip irrigation method is one of the most efficient ways to rationalise water consumption and avoid losses. This study was conducted in order to assess the scheduling of the drip irrigation system used on the Fadak farm in the holy city of Karbala in Iraq, in order to investigate irrigation scheduling there and to compare this with established irrigation scheduling parameters. This required the study of the physical properties of the soil and water consumption calculations for the palm trees being irrigated using the CROPWAT 8.0 simulation program. The results indicated that the volume of water actually supplied to each plot of around dunum( 2,500 m2) is 1,533.5 m3 annually, while the volume of water that should be supplied to the farm is 1,388 m3, suggesting that there is wastage of 145.5 m3, or 10.7{\%}, annually. The monthly losses show that the irrigation scheduling system currently used on the farm exposes the plants to excess irrigation over many months, resulting in a loss of water, while causing plants to be exposed to a decrease in irrigation water, which causes stress, in other months. Using surface irrigation, the volume of water needed per dunum is 12,617 m3, however, causing water waste to the volume 11,229 m3. This study thus confirms the general efficiency of the drip irrigation system, as well as highlighting that the CROPWAT 8.0 program is useful for calculating water consumption.},

abstract = {Background  Indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated nets are among the key malaria control intervention tools. However, their efficacy is declining due to the development and spread of insecticide resistant vectors. In Ethiopia, several studies reported resistance of An. arabiensis to multiple insecticide classes. However, such data is scarce in irrigated areas of the country where insecticides, pesticides and herbicides are intensively used. Susceptibility of An. gambiae s.l. to existing and new insecticides and resistance mechanisms were assessed in Arjo-Didessa sugarcane plantation area, southwestern Ethiopia. Methods Adult An. gambiae s.l. reared from larval/pupal collections of Arjo-Didessa sugarcane irrigation area and its surrounding were tested for their susceptibility to selected insecticides. Randomly selected An. gambiae s.l. (dead and survived) samples were identified to species using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were further analyzed for the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles using allele-specific PCR. Results Among the 214 An. gambiae s.l. samples analyzed by PCR, 89{\%} (n = 190) were An. amharicus and 9{\%} (n = 20) were An. arabiensis. Mortality rates of the An. gambiae s.l. exposed to deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin were 85{\%} and 86.8{\%}, respectively. On the other hand, mortalities against pirmiphos-methyl, bendiocarb, propoxur and clothianidin were 100{\%}, 99{\%}, 100{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively. Of those sub-samples (An. amharicus and An. arabiensis) examined for presence of kdr gene, none of them were found to carry the L1014F (West African) allelic mutation. Conclusion Anopheles amharicus and An. arabiensis from Arjo-Didessa sugarcane irrigation area were resistant to pyrethroids which might be synergized by extensive use of agricultural chemicals. Occurrence of pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors could challenge the ongoing malaria control and elimination program in the area unless resistance management strategies are implemented. Given the resistance of An. amharicus to pyrethroids, its behavior and vectorial capacity should be further investigated.},

Four types of soils were investigated using emitter discharge of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 l h−1. Wetting diameter was measured at six equal time intervals of water application. An equal volume of water was applied. After 1 h of supply of water, wetted soil was cut to observe the maximum wetted width and depth. Wet soil samples were taken from every patch of 10 × 10 cm to find the percentage of moisture by the gravimetric method. Empirical equations were developed for wetted depth and radius. Additional experiments with emitter discharge of 1–18 l h−1 were performed in sandy loam to obtain more data for accurate estimation of the coefficients of the empirical equations. Two computer programs based on trial and error and the generalized reduced‐gradient non‐linear‐optimized technique were used to find values of the coefficients. Root mean square error between the measured and simulated wetted radius and depth was minimized in optimization. Optimal emitter spacing for each type of soil was determined from the recorded data, which was found to be 35, 40, 40 and 45 cm in sandy loam, loam, clayey loam and clay respectively. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Dans le but de d{\'{e}}terminer l'espacement optimal des {\'{e}}metteurs dans l'irrigation au goutte‐{\`{a}}‐goutte, des exp{\'{e}}riences ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} effectu{\'{e}}es pour examiner les effets du d{\'{e}}bit de l'{\'{e}}metteur sur le p{\'{e}}rim{\`{e}}tre mouill{\'{e}} et de leur espacement.

abstract = {Irrigation by surge flooding does not always wet the soils thoroughly, and we have investigated the reasons for this on an irrigated plot in northern Senegal by monitoring the water budget during a rice cropping season (100 days). The amount of water added during each irrigation event was measured, and evapotranspiration and infiltration were estimated with lysimeters and Muntz infiltration rings, respectively. At the same time, piezometric levels, neutron probe values and water tension data were recorded at two stations in the plot. These measurements showed unusual results: infiltration rate was less than 1 x 10 super(-6) mm s super(-1) (less than 0.1 mm a day), there was a constant water deficit during the entire irrigation period, around 50 cm deep, and tensiometers at 40 cm reacted very slowly to water infiltration. The water fluxes in the vadose zone derived from these data showed clearly a discrepancy between fluxes calculated from hydraulic gradients and fluxes calculated from mass conservation. The hydraulic gradients suggested a zero flux plane at 40 cm below the surface, but the calculated values of the fluxes overestimated by several orders of magnitude the infiltration rates determined on the plot, whereas fluxes determined from mass conservation matched far better. These results show that air was entrapped between the shallow water table and the wetting front, and this inhibited water infiltration. Modelling water flow down the soil profile with a computer program for simulating one-dimensional water movement (Hydrus) confirmed that single-phase models cannot describe imbibition in this situation. Simple infiltration models based on a modified Green-Ampt equation accounting for air compression and air counterflow, however, fit experimental infiltration data much better. We demonstrated that where surge flooding is associated with a shallow water table, as in many large irrigation schemes, one must take into account the presence of air to quantify the flow of water into the soil.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The planned interventions to enhance adaptation and build
resilience of predominantly rainfed and vulnerable smallholder
production systems to climate change in African drylands include
small-scale irrigation using rainwater harvesting reservoirs. However,
the required technological improvement, participatory breakthroughs,
institutional settings, farm risk management, and investment
justification are rarely established comprehensively and integrated into
adaptive planning.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and assess new reservoir-based climate-resilient
and risk-efficient irrigation cropping strategies synthesizing
technological, participatory, institutional, managerial, and investment
capabilities.
METHODS: We crafted an innovative rice and vegetable pond irrigation
system together with governance arrangements and cropping schedule
adjustments tailored to the system. The system was validated through a
fiveyear participatory on-farm experiment in northern Ghana. Using
agronomic, hydrological, and socioeconomic data obtained from the
experiments and surveys, we constructed and extended empirical
bioeconomic models through simple risk programming to identify
irrigation cropping strategies that are the most efficient in securing
smallholders' food and income and resilient to interannual climate
fluctuations. The net present values were computed to determine the
financial effects of the identified strategies on the investment payback
of the pond system.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Shifting sowing dates allowed smallholders to
irrigate timely, albeit sparingly, without compromising their autonomous
adaptations in rainfed systems. Supplementary irrigation and improved
weed control increased the average rice yield by 23{\%}, more than doubled
the profitability, and lowered the coefficients of its variation
compared to that of rainfed rice (from 48{\%} to 38{\%}). Vegetable
irrigation in the dry season was even more profitable. The
risk-efficient cropping strategies identified by empirical models mostly
combined multiple rainfed crop choices with balanced irrigation
allocation between rice and vegetables enabling food self-sufficiency
and increased income level and stability. A 5000 m(3) pond storage
capacity was sufficient to secure these benefits under the observed
climate fluctuations. The cropping strategy found to produce sufficient
financial increments to achieve mid-term (8-to-12-years) payback of pond
investment under the same level of risk that smallholders accepted under
rainfed systems is among the most advisable.
SIGNIFICANCE: We addressed multidimensional challenges underlying
planned adaptation through reservoir irrigation. The innovative pond
system established can offer promising alternatives and complement
smallholder autonomous adaptations to secure food and income under a
changing climate. The identified strategic compromise between farm risk
management and investment payback can reconcile local intention and
policy guidance to develop concerted adaptation actions.},

abstract = {This study was initiated to explore market opportunities for smallholder vegetable growers of Maynugus irrigation scheme in Laelay Michew Woreda, Central Zone of Tigray Region. The objective of the study was, to describe market channel of vegetable producers, to analyze the determinants of vegetable quantity supply in the study area and identify the major constraints and opportunities of vegetable marketing system in the study area. The data was collected from smallholders using pre-tested interview schedule, and the researcher used checklists to gather information from officers of the community and traders. This was supplemented by secondary data collected from different published and unpublished sources. Multiple linear regression econometric model was employed to analyze the determinants of vegetable quantity supply after testing goodness of fit by link test and assumptions imposed on model by different methods. The result obtained from this analysis indicates that amount ofvegetable produce in and family active labor force were found to be the most important significant variables influencing positively whereas, distance to the nearest road was found significant variable influencing negatively vegetable marketable supply in the study area. The market channel description of the vegetable indicates a very short route. The main market participants of the vegetable marketing of the study area during the survey period were wholesalers and retailers. Besides, a significant amount of 31.4 per cent vegetable produced was channelled directly to consumers from producers. Major problems of the vegetable marketing identified and prioritized by vegetable producer smallholders in the study area were price instability, absence of marketing cooperatives, lack of market information, lack of storage, lack of extension, and lack of marketing contract arrangements. However, high demand of vegetable products, availability of the irrigation scheme, prolonged fasting period of Orthodox Christians and increase the price of substitute goods were the opportunities assessed by smallholder vegetable growers in the study area. Based on the study results, interventions demanded to raise marketable supply of vegetables produced are recommended.},

abstract = {This paper explores ways to increase public investments in agricultural water management and irrigation for improved agricultural productivity in Southern Africa, with a specific focus on Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. The analysis was based on a critical review of literature and assessment of the national agricultural investment plans and agricultural/water policies in the study countries. Despite the potential to improve agricultural productivity, irrigation does not currently play a significant role in Southern African agriculture. There have been efforts and formal commitments at the continental, regional and country levels to promote investments in agricultural water management and irrigation to improve and sustain agricultural productivity. However, despite these commitments, actual implementation has been a challenge and the first 5 years of national agricultural investment plans have passed or are now coming to an end without much progress having been made regarding actual investments. Lack of adequate resources and institutional capacity have been some of the challenges affecting implementation of the investment plans to meet commitments in sustainable land and water management. Overall, as countries plan for the second phase of the CAADP programme, there are opportunities to ensure that investments in agricultural water management and irrigation and complementary technologies are prioritised and allocated adequate resources for implementation.},

abstract = {Introduction . Walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) is a major complication of acute pancreatitis. We hypothesized that an extended (2 cm) cystogastrostomy opening combined with hydrogen peroxide irrigation can increase the success of endoscopic necrosectomy and decrease the number of required endoscopic interventions. The aim of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the technique in the management of WOPN.  Methods . This is a retrospective chart review of all cases that underwent EUS with extended cystogastrostomy and hydrogen peroxide irrigation prior to necrosectomy in a tertiary referral medical center. Clinical success was defined as complete resolution of the cyst cavity or a cyst cavity less than 2 cm in size on follow-up imaging.  Results . 19 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean size of the walled-off cavity was    11   +   0.9   cm. Technical success of the procedure was 100{\%}. The median number of necrosectomy sessions was 2 (range 1 to 7). Cavity resolution was noted in 18 out of 19 patients resulting in a clinical success of 94.7{\%}. The median follow-up period was 12 months. The adverse events rate in our cohort was 15.7{\%}.  Conclusion . Extended cystogastrostomy coupled with hydrogen peroxide irrigation of WOPN cavity is safe and feasible.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of water-related policies on women's empowerment on irrigation schemes of the North West Province of South Africa. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 84 women on 5 irrigation schemes across the province. These irrigation schemes have been under different management styles over the recent past years. Data were collected on their demographics and empowerment using a modified Women Empowerment Agriculture Index developed by IFPRI. The indices covered women's access and control to physical, natural, social, financial, and human livelihood capital. The study also examined empowerment indices to show different areas where women are empowered and this included the use of income, 53{\%} are disempowered, about 60.2{\%} of women are disempowered in access to productive capital and access to credit, while about 50{\%} are empowered in leadership and decision making. Significant determinants of empowerment were expenditure (t=1.68) and drip irrigation type (t=1.71). The results highlighted different areas of intervention in order to ensure an adequate level of empowerment across the livelihood capital for women on irrigation schemes. It also highlights the need to promote women's participation in decision-making for water management and also suggests ways in which women's access to water can be improved through equitable development.},

These programs offer farmers funding to upgrade infrastructure in return for a portion of their water rights. This study measures the effects of Australian Government on-farm infrastructure programs in the southern MDB between 2009–2010 and 2016–2017, particularly the On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program. A novel dataset is constructed combining program administrative data with farm survey data. This data is used to derive econometric estimates on the effects of these programs on various measures of farm productivity, profitability and water demand. On-farm programs are found to have positive effects for participants in terms of higher farm productivity and profitability. However, the study also finds a Jevon's paradox outcome, where farm demand for water is significantly higher post-upgrade. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {This study uses data from a special tabulation of the USDA Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey to examine the relationship between farm size and adoption of a variety of water management practices across seven Colorado Basin states. Parametric (Cochran-Armitage trend test) and non-parametric (Goodman-Kruskal gamma) methods were used to estimate associations between farm size and adoption of water management practices, use of water management information, and participation in conservation programs. Farms were divided into five categories: small farms, medium farms, large farms and very large farms, based on their gross sales. In all seven states, very large farms relied on a greater number of different information sources for water management than small farms. The relationship between farm size and information source use was not always monotonic, however. Small farms were more likely to rely more on their neighbors and irrigation district staff for water management information. Large and very large farms relied on a more diverse set of information sources and relied more on privately provide sources, such as consultants.  In very few cases was a public or private information source used by more than half of any group of farmers. There is no “one-stop shopping” for irrigation management information. Smaller farms were more likely to not have investigated ways to improve water or energy conservation practices in the previous five years. Farmers cited economic factors as the most important largest constraints on adoption of conservation investments. Larger farms were more likely to participate in government (federal, state, or local) other conservation programs. These farms, though, account for the greatest share of water use. Many smaller farms do not have control over the timing of their irrigation applications, but rather depend on irrigation districts to supply water “in turn.” Extension messaging to improve irrigation timing may be more effective if they target irrigation district staff that control irrigation scheduling.},

@article{Massey2014a,
abstract = {Although intermittent flooding of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been shown to significantly reduce irrigation demand, farmer adoption is limited in the United States where continuous flooding remains standard practice. This limited extent of adoption stems in part from a number of scalability and agronomic concerns. This study used replicated trials established in farmer-managed fields to determine if intermittent flooding can be successfully adapted to commercial-scale rice production in Mississippi. When intermittent flooding was coupled with multiple-inlet rice irrigation (MIRI), the quantities and qualities of yields were maintained or increased for five commercial rice varieties and one hybrid, relative to continuously-flooded controls. Only CL151 exhibited a decrease in total head rice when milled, this after being subjected to five or more wetting and drying cycles over ≈80 day flood periods. Water use over three years averaged 32{\%} less than comparable MIRI systems not using intermittent flooding. These results demonstrate that intermittent flooding can be successfully adapted by producers to commercial-scale and that 600mm irrigation is an achievable goal for rice grown on clay soils in Mississippi. The positive yield responses of CL162 to intermittent flooding and pre-flood urea-nitrogen support research showing that rice benefits from carefully managed wetting- and drying-periods when used in conjunction with effective pest management. The success of these producers at adapting intermittent rice flooding to commercial scale can be attributed in part to their having comprehensive weed and disease management programs, proficiency in using MIRI, and reliable irrigation systems with ample well capacities that allowed rapid flood establishment. Even partial adoption of intermittent rice flooding can increase rainfall capture and reduce demand for irrigation. In turn, this could help to alleviate overdraft of the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial aquifer, a resource of national and international significance.},

Farmer attitudes toward participation in irrigation management and their attitudes toward personnel of Water Authority and Agricultural Extension Service Centers (AESC) are correlated with farmer participation in irrigation management. Problem perception also has a significant effect on farmer participation. Educational programs and the removal of obstacles, such as unequal water distribution, can be helpful in improving farmer attitudes toward participation. Water agency personnel have more frequent visits with farmers to receive their opinions and gain their trust, and to keep them informed about related issues. The results show that farmers with greater land area and larger family sizes participate more in irrigation management.},

Multilateral donors are increasingly funding FLID as a development strategy in sub‐Saharan Africa to expand irrigation coverage, recognizing co‐benefits such as enhanced climate resilience, improved household food insecurity, and alleviated rural poverty. This review suggests that FLID can be understood as a farmer response to the shortcomings of neoliberal structural adjustment and cost recovery policies. Simultaneously, multilateral donor‐funded FLID projects advance Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) policy tools, exposing a policy paradox. Following multilateral and bilateral donor investments in FLID over 30 years, the review establishes how farmers initiated their own irrigation investments and the subsequent “scale‐up” of FLID by multilateral finance institutions. The stances of multilateral donors (e.g., World Bank) and multilateral entities (e.g., FAO) toward water governance for FLID present a contradictory picture. The review demonstrates how multilateral donors have transformed FLID into distinct agribusiness project models through Water‐Energy‐Food nexus and climate frameworks, with attention to farmers' collective action strategies. However, collective action as an avenue for the expansion of FLID does not automatically guarantee a socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable process across project models. Future research should focus on examining socioeconomic impacts on farmers participating in a project intervention, as well as farmers and irrigated value chain actors in proximal areas, to work toward effective and equitable water governance for FLID.This article is categorized under:Human Water {\textgreater} Water GovernanceHuman Water {\textgreater} Rights to Water},

abstract = {The utilization of treated paper mill effluents for irrigation offers many benefits such as conservation of water resources, conversion of barren land into irrigated area, addition of nutrients to the soil and plant and above all the reduction of pollution of inland water bodies. However, the utility of this effluent irrigation programme depends mainly on farmers' acceptability, adoption and management of the scheme. Knowledge about the farmers' perception is thus very much imperative for further advocacy of the effluent irrigation programme. The determinants of farmers' perception of treated paper mill effluent irrigation is a pre-requisite for the formulation of better programmes and strategies for the support of an unobstructed adoption and for the long-term sustainability of effluent irrigation schemes. The present study was conducted to assess the farmers' perception and the determinants that influence the adoption of treated paper mill effluent irrigation by interviewing a random sample of 120 farmers, using a well-structured interview schedule in paper mill effluent irrigated area in Tamil Nadu in India. The study revealed that there exists positive significant correlation between the perception and the characteristics of the farmers viz. educational status, farm size, annual income, mass media exposure, innovativeness and risk orientation. The response analysis of the perception revealed that treated paper mill effluent as alternative assured supply of irrigation water, conversion of elevated dry lands to irrigated land, changing of cropping pattern to sugarcane, increase in socioeconomic status of the farmers, incentives and technical inputs by the paper mill authorities and above all farmers' participation in planning, implementation and management of the effluent irrigation schemes influenced the farmers to form positive perception.},

abstract = {Irrigation programmes are usually based on technical and economic considerations without substantial involvement of the target farmers. This study aimed to investigate farmers' discourse, practices and perceptions, and to emphasize progress, limit and synergy of farmers' representation in the modernization programme undertaken by engineers in the Fatnassa oasis in southern Tunisia. Analyses of constraints were based on the modernization programmes and on farmers' interviews. Causal relationships were represented separately as problem trees according to farmers' and engineers' perceptions. The technical solutions implemented by engineers did not achieve the expected enhancement because they disregarded inappropriate community management of the oasian system. Farmers were aware of constraints related to waterlogging and hot irrigation water since they can link causes and effects. The low frequency of delivery water turns was cited as the main constraint in spite of the fact that the farmers were themselves accountable for some inefficient irrigation practices and continuous extension of date palm plantation. Farmers failed to mention soil degradation and salinity, which were only perceived indirectly, or because they applied corrective measures. This case study allowed a critical reflection on the limitations of each approach and for the combination of experts and farmers' knowledge.},

abstract = {In South-east Spain the implementation of desalinated seawater for irrigation was planned as an alternative water supply for farmers. However, most high-volume desalination plants are underused as farmers' current demands are lower than was previously expected. In order to develop programmes promoting an effective behavioural shift of farmers toward desalinated water, it is necessary to first explore their preferences and attitudes. This paper shows the results of a survey examining the attitudes and behaviour of farmers toward the use of desalinated seawater for irrigation in the South-east of Spain. The results show the existence of different farmer typologies regarding desalinated seawater use, as well as their preferences and attitudes. The main finding of this study has been to identify further factors, besides price, that condition the acceptance of the use of desalinated seawater. Finally, a series of measures are proposed to encourage the use of desalinated seawater for irrigation based on the identified profiles. The insights gained from this study could be useful for other regions where the construction of desalination plants has been planned as a measure to increase the availability of irrigation water.},

abstract = {The use of wastewater to produce food crops particularly vegetables is very prevalent in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This practice may pose health risks to farm workers and consumers. Hence, the study was designed to evaluate farmersâ perceptions on irrigation water quality, health risks and health risk mitigation measures in four wastewater-irrigated urban vegetable farming sites in Addis Ababa. Data were collected on farm through 263 individual interviews and 12 focus group discussions. The findings showed that despite differences in levels of knowledge and awareness on health risks, farmers appear informed about the contamination of their irrigation water. The difference in perception to quality consideration of Akaki River/irrigation water is highlighted by the result of KruskalâWallis H test analysis which shows significant mean value (1.33) of positive perception toward the water quality by male than female farmers. Interestingly, significant difference (pÂ {\textless}Â 0.05) in mean values of awareness toward problems of eating unwashed vegetables is also found between male and female farmers where females seemed to be more aware. Conversely, no significant difference was found in mean value of perception and awareness toward vegetables quality. Among the perceived health risks, skin problems were top-rated health risk while eye burn, sore feet and abdominal pains were rated low across the four farming sites. Although statistically not significant, perception toward consumption-related health risk differed with gender: females assigned relatively high mean score. Irrespective of the farming site and gender differences, the most accepted health risk reduction measures were health promotion programs and cessation of irrigation before harvesting. In view of crop restriction measures, females assigned significantly (pÂ =Â 0.044) low mean score to planting non-food produce. Akaki-Addis farmers suitability perceptions of planting non-food produce and non-raw eaten crops were significantly (pÂ {\textless}Â 0.001) higher than the other farming sites. Therefore, effective site and gender-specific educational programs have the potential for clarifying farmers and consumersâ risks and risk management perceptions and improving practical knowledge, which in turn may help identify adoption barriers, opportunities and incentives.},

abstract = {The major work in this study addresses the factors that govern the environmental fate and mobility of oestrogens in soils.  The work starts with the investigation of the sorption affinity of these oestrogens on soils and the relationship between sorption and the octanol-water partition coefficient (Ko$\omega$).  The results show that the Ko$\omega$ is a good predictor of sorption among contaminants.  The work moves on to identify factors which influence the sorption behaviour of oestrogens in soils.  Significant effects on oestrogen behaviour were observed in soils as salinity, pH and temperature were varied, which is indicated by the changing sorption coefficient (K­d) obtained from batch sorption equilibrium experiments.  The calculated sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon (Koc) indicates that all oestrogens increase in mobility in all soils as the pH increases whilst decrease in mobility as the temperature and salinity increase.  From the calculated bioconcentration factors (BCFs), bioaccumulation in plant leaves is highly expected if the applied irrigation techniques have direct contact between sewage treatment effluent and plant leaves.  Whereas, following direct contact between sewage treatment effluent and soils, calculated BCFs indicate lower occurrence of bioaccumulation in plants.  Biomagnification in humans, especially infants, from meat or milk consumption would be expected following irrigation with sewage treatment effluent.  Thus, this study strongly recommends further investigation into the safety of reuse of sewage treatment effluent as irrigation water for crops and forage.  The results is this study also indicate a considerable difference between experimental value and values generated by computational model, Estimation Program Interface (EPISUITE).  This study strongly shows that although the computational model is indicative it does not accurately assess the environmental impact of contaminants.},

abstract = {Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a common and costly morbidity after colorectal surgery. This rate remains high even in the setting of strict adherence to Surgical Care Improvement Project Protocols. The aim of our pilot study was to determine the feasibility and safety of subcutaneous gentamicin injection or pressurized irrigation as adjuncts to reduce SSI. A total of 132 patients who underwent colorectal surgery at the VA North Texas Health Care System were prospectively assigned to a pressurized irrigation group (n = 44), a preincision gentamicin injection group (n = 48), or control (n = 40). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of these strategies. Patient demographics were matched among groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify possible predictions of SSI in this cohort. The rate of SSI in the control group was 25 per cent, 13.5 per cent in the pressurized irrigation group, and 12.5 per cent in the gentamicin group (P = 0.26). Combined, the intervention groups had a 13 per cent SSI versus 25 per cent control (P = 0.09). Operative time was not increased by the interventions and no intraoperative complications specifically related to the interventions were noted. Postoperative complications were not different between groups. Both albumin and body mass index were associated with SSI. Body mass index was and independent predictor of SSI (P = 0.006). In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the interventions described. There was no detrimental effect of either intervention. There was trend toward a reduction in SSI in the intervention group, which warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a common and costly morbidity after colorectal surgery. This rate remains high even in the setting of strict adherence to Surgical Care Improvement Project Protocols. The aim of our pilot study was to determine the feasibility and safety of subcutaneous gentamicin injection or pressurized irrigation as adjuncts to reduce SSI. A total of 132 patients who underwent colorectal surgery at the VA North Texas Health Care System were prospectively assigned to a pressurized irrigation group (n = 44), a preincision gentamicin injection group (n = 48), or control (n = 40). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of these strategies. Patient demographics were matched among groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify possible predictions of SSI in this cohort. The rate of SSI in the control group was 25 per cent, 13.5 per cent in the pressurized irrigation group, and 12.5 per cent in the gentamicin group (P = 0.26). Combined, the intervention groups had a 13 per cent SSI versus 25 per cent control (P = 0.09). Operative time was not increased by the interventions and no intraoperative complications specifically related to the interventions were noted. Postoperative complications were not different between groups. Both albumin and body mass index were associated with SSI. Body mass index was and independent predictor of SSI (P = 0.006). In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the interventions described. There was no detrimental effect of either intervention. There was trend toward a reduction in SSI in the intervention group, which warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {The first essay examines feral hog control as an economic issue. Feral hogs are an invasive species and their presence can lead to spread of disease to livestock, crop damage, loss of wildlife, intrusion in green spaces, and many other detrimental consequences. The key to widespread control and eradication of feral hogs lies not only with innovative technology but with institutions and incentives. A change in laws that prevents incentives for individuals to continue to transport and release wild hogs as well as help reallocating abatement resources to work towards a socially optimal level of feral hog control. The second essay assesses the relationship of the RMA index and forage yields for the Rainfall Index Annual Forage Program and proposes additional indices composed of precipitation frequency events and minimum temperature events. The precipitation frequency index sums the number of days precipitation events occurred over a two month time period while the minimum temperature index sums the number of days where the minimum temperature was below 32 degrees Fahrenheit over a two month time period. The RMA index intervals were positively related to yields and significant for wheat. For triticale, oats, rye, and ryegrass, none of the indices were consistently significant indicating that a variable that better explains forage yields is necessary to assist producers in protecting against forage yield loss. The third essay determines the effects of irrigation system upon young pecan growth, nut quality, and nutrient uptake. The five irrigation systems were Nelson R-5 rotator (35 ft diameter) sprinkler, Nelson R-10 rotator (70 ft diameter) sprinkler, two subsurface driplines irrigating for two days a week alternating between water for two hours and no water for two hours, two subsurface driplines irrigating one day a week for twenty hours continuously, four subsurface driplines irrigating for ten hours continuously for one day a week, and a control with no irrigation. Irrigation systems affected foliar levels of potassium, boron, and manganese levels. No significant difference was found in expected change in trunk diameter or kernel percentage by irrigation system. Using a spatial Durbin error model, trunk diameters of non-irrigated and the four subsurface dripline irrigation system trees were significantly less than those trees that were irrigated by the two subsurface irrigation driplines for twenty hours continuously system.},

abstract = {Increasing costs and more limited availability of water and fertiliser, coupled with mounting concern over nutrient leaching damaging the environment has led to greater interest in improved methods of managing these inputs. Greenhouse horticulture could, until recently, be characterised by large fertiliser inputs and low fertiliser use efficiency. Adoption of fertigation (application of fertilisers through irrigation water) within greenhouse production systems brings the potential for close control of both water and fertiliser applications. It is claimed that timing, amounts and ratios of fertilisers applied are easily controlled leading to optimisation of yield and product quality. However efficient operation of fertigation systems is hampered by lack of data on optimum consumption rates of essential nutrients by important crops as functions of time. The biological, chemical and physical database on fertigation is still very limited and simple extrapolation of the data to different climatic and substrate conditions may lead to operational errors. The aim of this research study was to evaluate the effects of varying fertiliser concentration and irrigation frequency on growth and yield of greenhouse bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) grown in rockwool using a fertigation system. A study on responses to varying nitrogen and potassium concentrations at different growth stages showed that increasing N from 126mg l-1 to 265mg l-1 and 385mg l-1 and increasing K from 106 mg l-1 to 214mg l-1 and 321mg l-1 increased fruit yield significantly over the control. Higher yield was associated with higher leaf area and total dry matter production, better quality fruits and better nutrient uptake. Indications were that recommended doses of nutrients in soil-less culture should change according to the growth stage of the crop with the fertigation program being adjusted during the growing season to suit plant development. In another experiment, effects of varying nitrogen and potassium rates and ratios on growth, yield, and the incidence of blossom - end rot (BER), leaf chlorophyll content, Fertigation of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in a soil-less greenhouse system photosynthetic aspects and NPK uptake was investigated. Phosphorus concentration (55mg l-1) was kept constant whilst N:K ratio varied. Increasing the NPK concentration from low concentration (44-55-71 mg l-1) to high concentration (126-55-106 mg l-1) significantly increased growth and yield with no further increases up to 500-55-625 mg l-1. Plants subjected to high NPK concentration in the second and third stage had more fruits with BER. The implications are that nutrient management must avoid too low and too high fertiliser concentrations and carefully manage electrical conductivity (EC) of nutrient solution in order to achieve high yield and quality whilst reducing nutrient leaching to the environment. The ability of fertigation systems to increase irrigation frequency affords a major advantage to crop production. As no research had examined effects of irrigation frequency at different growth stages an experiment was made to quantify the potential benefits of more frequent irrigation. With 20 irrigation events day-1 throughout the season, yield increased significantly by 22{\%} over the control (5 irrigation events day-1 throughout the season). Higher yield was associated with taller and thicker plants, higher leaf area, greater total dry matter production, bigger fruits and better NPK uptake. The difference in growth and yield over the control could be attributed to differences in leaf phosphorus concentration, indicating the main effect of fertigation frequency was related to improved phosphorus mobilisation and uptake. Increasing the daily fertigation frequency from five to twenty irrigation events day-1 significantly reduced BER incidence. A final experiment examined effects of defoliation (removal of older, lower leaves) which may influence nutrient use efficiency and dry matter production and partitioning. There were four treatments: two irrigation schedules (5 and 10 irrigation events per day) and two defoliation strategies (0{\%} defoliation and 20{\%} of lower leaves removed). Defoliated plants reduced yield compared to non-defoliated plants irrespective of fertigation frequency because of less leaf area, lower total dry matter production and lower NPK uptake. Clearly, defoliation caused by leaf eating insects, disease or deliberate removal by the grower should be avoided or yield is likely to suffer.},

abstract = {In a field experiment with white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata (L.) alef.) in Germany, three irrigation scheduling approaches were tested: (i) three sprinkler irrigation schedules based on soil water balance calculations using different development-dependent crop coefficients; (ii) automatic drip irrigation based on soil water tension thresholds; (iii) irrigation scheduling by real-time application of a partially calibrated mechanistic crop growth model. Multi-objective calibration was applied to derive a fully calibrated model as a diagnostic tool to identify the water loss terms of the individual irrigation strategies.The results of the experiment showed that: (i) high yields can be achieved with relatively low amounts of irrigation water ({\~{}}100mm), provided the optimal irrigation strategy and technique are applied; (ii) automated tension threshold-based drip irrigation outperformed soil water balance or crop growth model-based strategies; (iii) the soil water balance calculation approach relying on recommended K sub(c) factors led to an enormous overirrigation; (iv) the application of a partially calibrated crop growth model led to an underestimation of the crop water requirements in conjunction with an incorrect timing of irrigation events and therefore resulted in the lowest yields. The diagnostic model identified percolation, for the wet sprinkler irrigation treatments, and canopy evaporation, for the dry and model-based treatments, as major water loss sources; only minimal additional water was lost in the tension-controlled treatment.Original Abstract: Resume Dans une experience de terrain avec du chou blanc (Brassica oleracea convar capitata var. alba) en Allemagne, trois approches de calendriers d'irrigation ont ete testees: (i) trois programmes d'irrigation par aspersion, fondes sur des calculs du bilan hydrique du sol bases sur des coefficients culturaux; (ii) une irrigation au goutte a goutte automatique basee sur des seuils de pression d'eau du sol; (iii) une irrigation par l'application en temps reel d'un modele mecaniste de croissance des cultures partiellement calibre. Des calibrations multiples objectives ont ete conduites pour deriver un modele entierement calibre, qui servira d'outil de diagnostic et d'identification des termes de perte d'eau resultant des strategies individuelles d'irrigation.Les resultats de l'experience ont montre que: (i) des rendements eleves peuvent etre atteints avec des quantites relativement faibles d'eau d'irrigation ({\~{}}100mm), a condition que les calendriers optimaux et que les techniques adaptees soient appliquees; (ii) l'irrigation au goutte a goutte a seuil de tension automatique a surperforme les strategies fondees bilan hydrique du {\textgreater} sur le modele de croissance des cultures; (iii) les methodes basees sur le calcul de bilan hydrique du sol a partir des coefficients culturaux K sub(c) ont conduit a une enorme surirrigation; (iv) l'application d'un modele de croissance des cultures partiellement calibree a conduit a une sous-estimation des besoins en eau des cultures en conjonction avec une mauvaise synchronisation des tours d'eau et ont donc entraine les rendements les plus faibles. Le modele de diagnostic a identifie la percolation, pour les traitements humides d'irrigation par aspersion, et la verriere evaporation, pour les traitements secs et de modeles bases, comme des sources majeures de perte de l'eau, que l'eau supplementaire minime a ete perdu dans le traitement de la tension controlee.},

abstract = {Irrigation canals waste some of the water during the conveyance and distribution process. Due to the effect of water losses on distribution planning and operation process, it is necessary to estimate the conveyance efficiency and water losses. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the performance of water conveyance in all level of canals and to carry out an in-depth analysis of the water losses problem in the irrigation schemes through a case study. Therefore, the recorded data in more than 40 selected points of the main, secondary and tertiary canals were analyzed. The use of ultrasonic flowmeter in this study provided an appropriate precision for determining seepage losses and water conveyance efficiency. Results show that conveyance efficiency for main, secondary, and tertiary canals in the 1000 m reaches are 95{\%}, 91.5{\%}, and 89.3{\%} respectively. In addition, the amount of seepage losses per unit of seepage surface for main, secondary, and tertiary canals is equal to 1.22, 1.18, and 0.63 m3/day respectively. Regarding the length of the canals, the total amount of seepage losses in a certain time and in an irrigation interval, in tertiary canals is more than secondary and in secondary canals is more than the main canal. In order to decrease the seepage losses, it is recommended to consider the serious preventive and corrective maintenance programs.},

abstract = {Three experimental field studies were conducted to evaluate an irrigation catch device (IrriGage), sprinkler irrigation cyclical nonuniformity effects on corn yield, and compare an ET-based irrigation scheduling tool (KanSched) with a crop growth model (CERES-Maize) for reduced irrigation effects on seven corn production sites under south central Kansas environmental conditions.    Field studies under three different sprinkler packages (fixed-plate, grooved-disk, FP; spinning plate, SP; and wobbling plate, WP) were conducted to evaluate the measurement accuracy of 10 cm diameter IG10 collectors in south central and north east Kansas. IG10 collectors can accurately measure irrigation depth and uniformity under SP and WP sprinkler packages but not FP sprinkler packages. Under FP sprinkler irrigation packages collectors with 15.2 cm or larger diameter openings should be considered.    Fixed-plate sprinklers produce larger droplets that are less susceptible to wind distortion and evaporative losses. One of the major concerns with these sprinkler packages is a cyclical (periodic) nonuniform irrigation pattern. A study was conducted on a coarse textured soil to evaluate the effect of cyclical, nonuniform, deficit (65{\%} of full irrigation) irrigation on corn yield. The low uniformity treatment had a coefficient of uniformity (CU) of 79 while the other two treatments had CU's of 91 and 92. Studies in 1999 and 2000 indicated that FP sprinkler package cyclical, nonuniform irrigation applications did not result in reduced corn yield.    Field studies were conducted on 7 corn production sites to evaluate corn yield response to deficit irrigation in south central Kansas. Those data were also used to evaluate the KanSched program. That program was used to mimic the field soil water status and seasonal crop water use under deficit irrigation practices on those sites. Additionally, the CERES-Maize growth crop model was used to simulate crop water use and yield response to deficit irrigation. Overall, deficit irrigation applications reduced yield especially in drier years. The KanSched program irrigation schedule agreed with the field-based net applied irrigation amounts, but under-estimated crop water use compared to CERES-Maize. The CERES-Maize model did not mimic deficit irrigated corn yield in south central Kansas.},

abstract = {In the semi-arid regions of South Asia, tank systems are the major source of irrigation. In India, the Telangana state government has initiated the Mission Kakatiya program to rejuvenate irrigation tank systems. Understanding the hydrological processes that supply water to these systems is critical to the success of these types of programs in India. The current study attempted to comprehend the hydrological processes and flow routing in the Salivagu watershed tank cascade system in Telangana. There are a lot of ungauged tank cascade systems in this region. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physically-based model, was used to simulate flow patterns in the Salivagu watershed with and without tank systems. The geospatially extracted area and volume were used for this study provided by WBIS-Bhuvan-NRSC. Additionally, the Katakshapur Tank Cascade System (KTCS) was chosen to analyze the water availability in each tank using the water balance approach. The Salivagu watershed flow simulation without tanks overestimated streamflow. The volume difference in flow between with and without tank was 606 Mm3, 615.9 Mm3, and 1011 Mm3 in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The SWAT simulated volumes of the Ramchandrapur and Dharmaraopalle tanks in KTCS were merely satisfied because the tank size was less than 0.7 km2 and the storage capacity was up to 1 Mm3. Due to tank sizes more than 0.8 km2 and capacities greater than 2 Mm3, the Mallampalli and Katakshapur tank simulation findings were in good agreement with WBIS-Bhuvan-NRSC. This research advances our understanding of the hydrological processes in ungauged cascading tank systems in tropical semi-arid regions.},

abstract = {"Introduction to Engineering Design" is offered at Frostburg State University for freshman students interested in engineering major. The main objective of this freshman design course is to introduce basic design concepts and to motivate the students towards their majors. The selected design topic in Fall-1999 was an automatic irrigation system powered by solar energy. During the design and prototype development process, students learned energy conversion principles, discussed various issues related to power generation, and gained hands-on experience on technical drawings and workshop activities. The paper discusses the educational impacts of the freshman design course on the motivation and professional orientation of students. I. Introduction Frostburg State University (FSU) started electrical and mechanical engineering programs in fall 1997 in collaboration with University of Maryland College Park (UMCP). Students enrolled in the FSU/UMCP Collaborative Engineering Program take all science, math, general education, basic engineering and design courses on campus from resident faculty. Upper level engineering courses are offered from UMCP over distance. The main objective of the Collaborative Engineering Education is to provide students located on a remote campus the opportunity to access advanced engineering courses of a metropolitan university1. The developed model is an economical way to extend engineering education possibility to remote areas without loosing experimentation and design activities and student-instructor interactions, which are essential for technical education. Although the program is based on delivery of upper level engineering courses over distance (via ITV), active learning is considered as one of the major characteristics of the curriculum. As a constituent institution of the ECSEL (Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership) program, University of Maryland has developed the concept of learning by design to "renovate undergraduate engineering education through the infusion of design experiences across the curriculum and to increase the diversity of the profession" as the "Year 9 Report for ECSEL2,3" states. This approach yielded the idea of introducing engineering design at the freshman level, starting the first day students enter the school of engineering4,5,6.},

Baseline data show large gender gaps, in which fewer women than men achieved adequacy in all 11 indicators of empowerment. Eighty-nine percent of women versus 64 percent of men respondents were not empowered, and 66 percent of dual-adult households have gender gaps. The main contributors of disempowerment among women were high tolerance and acceptance of intimate partner violence, lack of work balance, and low membership in groups, especially influential groups. Although 95 percent of respondents owned smartphones, women were less likely than men to access Internet or social media through their phones. Thirty-nine percent of respondents received rice-related information and half received health-related information. Nine to 14 percent of respondents attended agriculture- or health-related training courses. Women were significantly less likely to receive agriculture and nutrition-related information and training than men. The dietary diversity score, a common indicator of diet quality and a good proxy for nutrition, is low in the sample. The individual dietary diversity score was 4.32, with no significant difference between women and men and no major differences between irrigation water users and other households.

@phdthesis{Udas2014,
abstract = {This thesis is about gendered policy processes in the irrigation and drinking water sectors in Nepal. Globally, increased women's participation in formal decision making bodies such as water users' associations is extensively advocated as a means to reduce existing gender gaps in water access, control and management and ultimately achieve gender equality. In Nepal, this has resulted in water policies since the 1990s that aim to increase female users' participation in water users' committees. This study explores the complexities of achieving gender equity in these water sectors through such policy measuresThe thesis examines the complexities in three major overlapping domains of policy processes: policy framing, policy implementation and policy outcomes. The main research question guiding the study is: How do gender discourses, organizational and professional cultures, and power relations structure the outcomes and processes of planned efforts to increase women's participation in irrigation and drinking water users' organizations? This question is framed on the theoretical grounding that effectiveness of policy measures to improve women users' participation in water management depends significantly on how gender issues are perceived, framed, and addressed, in all domains. Research was undertaken through case studies of three irrigation systems and two drinking water systems supplied by the Baruwa river in Udayapur district in the Eastern Development Region of Nepal, all under farmer management, and also through work in sector offices at district, regional and central level.To answer the research question, this study first explores how different water policies have discursively constructed the links between gender and water use and management. It then investigates how policy measures have shaped or transformed gender differences in water management at system level, in terms of roles, rights, and responsibilities; and ultimately the individual's access to water. Finally, it examines how implementers at different levels have dealt with the task to address gender questions in their work.Based on a review of periodic development plans and water sector policies of the Nepal government, Chapter 2 investigates the way these plans and policies discursively constructed the linkages between the gender equity agenda and water sector development efforts of the state. The chapter shows that the gender equity agenda of the government only indirectly linked with water sector development discourses. The government visualised increased users' participation as a primary means to address inequity, with emphasis on increasing women's participation. Yet, how women's participation in water programmes could help redress inequities was not made explicit. At least in the drinking water sector, it was linked to a role for women in water management and system sustainability. However it remained vague in the irrigation sector. Here the emphasis on women users' participation in users' committees was perceived as an effort to achieve women's development rather than help water sector development. Based on policy approaches to promote participation, the sector-specific Water Resources Acts and Regulations visualised a water users' association (WUA) as the local entity to address issues around water allocation, distribution and conflict, with a monitoring role of the government. Issues of (gender) equity were thus implicitly delegated to local communities within the frame of a WUA, who were expected to arrange questions of equitable allocation and voice among themselves.Chapter 3, 4 and 5 form Part 1 of the thesis around ‘Access, Agency and Participation', which investigates policy outcomes for water access, with respect to increasing women users' participation in water users' committees. Chapter 3 introduces the Baruwa River Basin and the study area. Chapter 4 studies the three irrigation systems and Chapter 5 the two drinking water systems selected as case studies. Part I shows that attempts to improve women's participation in formal decision making domains of users organisations will by themselves not be enough to ensure users' access to water and redress gendered inequities in access to and control over water. One reason for this is that WUAs were found to be more interested in mobilising external resources for system improvement than internal issues of water equity in distribution. Besides, the functioning of a WUA depended on multiple layers of power relations among the users. The possibility to voice in WUA meetings was different for different users; hence the WUA meeting itself did not necessarily ensure all users' water rights. In addition, a WUA had differing levels of control in drinking water systems compared to irrigation. In drinking water systems, technical specificities of the infrastructure (both piped systems) made it relatively easy for the WUA to control water distribution: the taps of those who failed to pay could easily be closed. The open canal system in irrigation systems made water control more difficult and made acts of water theft easier, such as diverting water out of turn into one's field. While the WUAs did take more control of distribution and access in the drinking water systems, their actions were motivated to raise maintenance funds rather than ensuring that users' received the minimum water requirement for drinking.At individual level, Part I showed that access to water was the result of multiple factors. Access to irrigation water was found to be a function of an individual or group's bargaining power to negotiate for water, with much of these negotiations happening at the farm level between irrigating neighbours. In the case of drinking water systems, the ability to pay was important in determining access to and control over piped water. In the absence of money, maintaining good relations with neighbours proved important to gain access in the case of private tube-wells, taps and irrigation. The non-paying households were poor and often landless families who could not meet the charges for drinking water, or were families with alternatives such as tube-wells installed. Users' participation in WUA meetings showed the importance to understand both the possibility to raise one's voice and the possibility that one's voice is heard. The few women users who were present in the meetings were there often because of the opportunity cost of their participation for the family; as their wages as women were lower, it was less costly for the household if they participated instead of their husbands.All the five systems discussed in Part I suffered from headwork damage and reconstruction problems due to floods in the source river, raising concerns on government investment as well as intervention modalities. Particularly at question was the appropriateness and resilience of standard river diversion works for drinking water and irrigation systems in the Siwalik Hills of Nepal, and in drinking water systems the common design of including a reservoir and treatment works.Chapter 6, 7 and 8 are clustered as Part II on ‘Doing Gender' which investigates policy implementation, and examines implementers' actions at different levels to take up the task to increase women's participation in WUAs. Part II analyses the formal space to think and talk about gender in the Departments of Irrigation (DOI) and Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) of the Nepal government, which are the executing agencies to achieve national targets on irrigation and drinking water. It also analysed officers' actions with respect to their professional identity, organisational culture and their individual attitude towards gender questions. Part II shows that the prevailing organisational priorities, funding modalities, staff composition and issues of organisational survival offer limited scope to staff to think and talk about gender. Lack of institutional rewards for implementing the policy clause on increasing women's participation in the WUA committee, and a strong tendency to delegate ‘gender questions' (alongside other social questions) to less appreciated and underbudgeted management divisions and social scientists have resulted in less attention to implementation. At system level, officials belonging to the engineering service group, one of the professional subgroups of the Civil Service in Nepal that dominates staff composition of DOI and DWSS, face contradictions with their professional identity in addressing gender questions. Part II shows that what has been achieved so far has been the result of individual actions of particular officers, because of their personal convictions - regardless of whether they had an engineering or social science background. The study found that the way that officers perceived the policy agenda depends on their gender ideology and this determined their intention to work with it or not.Chapter 9 consolidates the findings of the study, and reflects on the participatory policies in Nepal and their possibilities to address inequities around water access. It reviews to what extent policy measures have improved participation as well as whether participation in water users' organizations has improved access to water for women. This study found that neither the linkage between policy and participation nor that between participation and access is straightforward. Firstly, the organisational culture of the implementing organisation and the professional and personal identity of an officer have a large influence on shaping the translation of these policies during implementation. Whether and how information about the participation policy reaches women water users depends importantly on (male) leaders' attitudes vis {\`{a}} vis the policy clause on women's representation when they visit the government office and get information about possible new projects and assistance. Ultimately, the actual materialisation of a woman's right to participate in a decision making forum depends on her agency to actually be present in the meeting, articulate her needs and bargain. Similarly, power dynamics among water users - that were only partly played out within formal decision making domains - are important in shaping women's actual access to water in the field beyond the WUA.Thus action to improve participation of women in users' committees in terms of numbers alone has only indirect impacts on equitable access to water and uncertain outcomes in improved water delivery to women and other vulnerable users.},

abstract = {In the light of climate changes and global warming, as well as the rapid expansion in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivation in Egypt, the development of sugar beet varieties with improved tolerance to high temperature and deficit irrigation is of great importance. The objective of this study was to evaluate sugar beet genotypes under high temperatures and deficit irrigation conditions for further identification and selection of heat and drought tolerant genotypes. In the current study, a panel of 18 sugar beet breeding lines produced at the USDA–ARS–NWISRL, Kimberly, ID, and the commercial sugar beet cultivar Kawimera were evaluated for yield and quality under high temperature. Six promising lines in terms of yield and quality were further evaluated under both high temperature and deficit irrigation for two growing seasons. All lines performed differently under deficit irrigation, indicating a high degree of genetic variability in the evaluated lines. Additionally, yield traits showed negative effect due to deficit irrigation. A significant positive correlation was observed between stress tolerance index (STI), and average root and sugar yields under stressed and non‐stressed conditions. A linear relationship between STI and average root and sugar yields indicates that STI is a reliable stress index to select high yielding genotypes under both optimum‐ and deficit‐irrigation conditions. USKPS25 and USC944‐6‐68 breeding lines are most likely adapted to deficit irrigation and high temperature and suitable to be utilized in the proposed sugar beet breeding programs in Egypt.},

Rice can accumulate toxic elements such as arsenic, with the crop water management strongly affecting uptake. This study utilises the Bengal and Assam Aus Panel to conduct genome wide association (GWA) mapping for arsenic in shoots and grains of rice grown over 2 years under continually flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). The aim was to assess genotype by water management interaction, identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for arsenic accumulation, and propose candidate genes for lowering grain arsenic.RESULTSAWD significantly reduced grain arsenic across all cultivars on average by 15.7 and 15.1{\%} in year 1 and 2 respectively and shoot arsenic by 27.0{\%} compared to the plants grown under CF. There was a weak cultivar by treatment interaction for grain for arsenic. All traits were strongly influenced by cultivar. GWA mapping identified a large number of 74 individual QTLs for arsenic, with six QTLs showing stability across years and/or water treatments. Three of the loci (one on chromosome 3, one on chromosome 4, and one on chromosome 5) were investigated in detail using an approach of clustering cultivars that had similar haplotypes for the QTL regions and then looking at the phenotypic values across the clusters. Two of the identified QTLs co-localised with known genes involved in arsenic accumulation, including Lsi2 which has not previously been reported to underlie a grain arsenic QTL.CONCLUSIONSThis study has identified a number of novel QTLs for arsenic accumulation, as well as cultivars that consistently accumulate less arsenic over multiple field traits. The use of a haplotype clustering approach after GWA mapping has allowed for the effect, in terms of arsenic accumulation, to be determined for cultivars that share similar genomic sequence. Allocating nine high yielding Bangladeshi cultivars to these clusters has identified the potential of utilising these QTLs in breeding programmes; for example, incorporation of the QTL on chromosome 5 should decrease grain arsenic in elite high yielding Bangladeshi cultivars by 10{\%} in all high yielding cultivars studied.},

abstract = {A field experiment was carried out using four inbred lines of maize BK112, Inb17, ZP607 and Zm6, as they were entered into half-diallel cross-breeding program in the fall season 2019, and 10 genotypes (6 crosses + 4 parents) were obtained according to the second Griffing method, the first model, in the spring season of 2020, the behavior of these inbreds and their hybrids were evaluated with three irrigation intervals with the aim of obtaining one or more distinct hybrids of pure strains derived from maize Zea mays L. under the irrigation interval and the study of hybrid vigor. The experiment was carried out in the fields of a farmer in Anbar Governorate, using the RCBD randomized complete block design (split – plot) with three replications. The irrigation interval (4, 8 and 12) days occupied the main plots, while the inbred and hybrids occupied the sub-plots. The results of the statistical analysis showed a significant effect of genotypes on the studied traits. The studied hybrids Zm6 × ZP607 were distinguished by their weight of 300 grains and the grain yield (85.83 g and 186.70 g) respectively. The plants grown under the irrigation interval 4 days outperformed the grain yield of the plant by giving it the highest yield of 156.03 g. It did not differ significantly with the 8-day irrigation interval, while the yield decreased significantly at the 12-day irrigation interval with a decrease of 120.8{\%} and 120.5{\%} than the 4 and 8 irrigation treatments, respectively. It was also found that the interaction was significant and reached the highest grain yield with an irrigation interval of 8 days, 224.0 g. The hybrid Zm6 × ZP607 gave the highest positive hybrid vigor for individual plant yield, which was 119.24{\%}, 126.72{\%} and 166.05{\%} for the irrigation interval of 4, 8 and 12 days, respectively. Therefore, the plant breeder can use the characteristics of the yield components as selection guides with the superior hybrids in yield and the strength of the hybrid.},

abstract = {Salicylic acid (SA) is one of the endogenous plant growth regulators that play an important role in the regulation of plant growth and development in response to water deficit. Genotypic‐specific response to exogenous applied SA in terms of physiological, enzymatic activity, and yield traits is poorly understood in tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Wimm. syn. Festuca arundinacea Schreb.]. Twenty genotypes of tall fescue (selected from a broad germplasm) were assessed at field condition for morphological and physiological characteristics during 2016 and 2017 under three irrigation levels (normal, mild, and intense drought stress) in the presence of two SA concentrations (0 and 1 mM). Mild and intense drought stress conditions led to depression in photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll a and b and total chlorophyll contents, plant height, crown diameter, and forage yield, despite increases in proline content, carotenoids, catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase activities. Application of SA decreased the adverse effects of drought stress by elevation of photosynthetic pigments and nonenzyme and enzymatic antioxidant activities and could enhance forage yield and drought tolerance in tall fescue genotypes. High genetic variation was observed among the genotypes in their response to the application of SA under drought stress conditions, and genotypes 3L and 1E were recognized as drought tolerant and stable genotypes for future breeding programs.},

abstract = {Soil salinization is a major problem affecting productivity of irrigated lands in arid and semi-arid areas. Managing salinity to minimize environmental impact is a prerequisite for sustainable irrigated agriculture. The objective of this study was to assess the level of salinity in Sego irrigated farm, Ethiopia and to map temporal and spatial distribution of salt affected soils to support management programmes. The study employed normal image classification, and developing models from ECe vs NDSI and thematic layers to map soil salinity, using geospatial tools. Multi-temporal Landsat TM images of 1984, 1995 and 2010 were used to detect salinity affected areas in the study area. Results of the study revealed that around 6ha of the area gets moderately to strongly salinized per year. Empirical model developed from ECe vs NDSI of 2010 image using regression analysis revealed the coefficient of relation as 66{\%}. The model was extended for the whole area, and revealed that 2.0{\%} of the study area was strongly saline and 54.7{\%} of the area was non-saline. Overlay model developed from water table, land form, land management type and land-cover has revealed that 11.2{\%} of the study area was non-saline, whereas 47.2{\%} and 3.0{\%} was moderately and strongly saline, respectively. Validation of the models was made to test their predication capability and the overlay model has revealed better correlation coefficient of 67.3{\%} to the measured ECe. Most of the salt affected areas were on shallow water table. Cambisols and fluvisols were greatly affected by salinity. The results indicate that long-term irrigation activities would affect agricultural potentiality of the area in the future, and geospatial tools are efficient and feasible for detecting salt affected areas from satellite images and thematic maps.},

The investigation of drip irrigation frequency effects in yield and in the proportion of biomass in the various plant parts and in the distribution of soil moisture were studied, in an experimental parcel of three interventions (i.e. irrigation per 9, 12 and 15 days) in a four replications, randomized complete block design (RCBD) with systematic plot arrangement, in a farm located in central Greece (Larissa), at the farming period of year 2003. The cut plants fractions results for the distribution of above ground biomass (dry matter), were: 47.74{\%} grain, 26.72{\%} stalk, 11.43{\%} leaf, 7.25{\%} cob, 6.86{\%} husk, and for the distribution of biomass in stover (dry matter) were: 49.75{\%} stalk, 22.27{\%} leaf, 16.22{\%} cob and 11.76{\%} husk. The mean biomass in stover yield was found 11,562.99 kg ha super(-1). It was observed that the 9 days irrigation treatment resulted in the greatest biomass in stover yield (13,198.02 kg ha super(-1)) and the highest potential for Bioethanol production (5,411.18 L ha super(-1)), and from the statistical analysis of the plots harvested mean biomass yields, it was found that their values were significantly different at level of significance p {\textless} 0.05. ICT provided significant insight into the nature of biomass yield and the field's spatial variability as effected of the integrated irrigation water management and its biofuel potential, aiming at water savings and environmental protection.},

abstract = {The use of groundwater for irrigation in the Wajo Regency has been going on since the 2000s. The use of groundwater has the potential to cause high production costs, which can reduce farmers' income. The Government of Wajo Regency provided a solution to this problem through the reservoir development program. However, the impact of the construction of reservoirs on environmental conservation is not yet known. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research that aims to determine reservoirs' effect to fulfill plant water needs and their impact on the environment. The study was conducted by direct measurement in the field of the observed variables. Some data are obtained in real-time using sensors such as rainfall, groundwater level changes, surface water level, and evaporation data. Data were analyzed using the water balance approach. The results showed that the construction of reservoirs to meet the water needs of plants could reduce the radius of the influence of groundwater extraction for irrigation which has so far reached 50-100 m, as well as reducing the decrease in groundwater level during pumping, which originally reached more than 5 m. The reservoir can increase the groundwater level as indicated by the increase that occurs when the surface water level increases.},

abstract = {This study highlights the groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics and processes (hydrochemistry characteristics, ion exchange, and salinization) and quality suitability assessment for irrigation purposes from five wells in the Greenbelt area located in northwestern Al-Najaf Governorate, Iraq. The suitability of groundwater for irrigation was assessed based on the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) for thirteen parameters and groundwater quality indices such as total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), soluble sodium percent (SSP), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), total hardness (TH), permeability index (PI), potential salinity (PS), Kelley's ratio (KR), and magnesium hazard ratio (MHR). The IWQI's average values ranged between 76–139. The results of IWQI for the first and second sampling sites showed values of 139 and 104, respectively, indicating that the groundwater was unsuitable and unsafe for irrigation. In contrast, the IWQI for the third, fourth, and fifth sites were 83, 97, and 76, respectively, indicating that the groundwater was safe and possibly used for irrigation. The EC, TDS, PS, and MHR indices were all found to be unsuitable for irrigation in all five sites, and the KR index was also found to be unsuitable for agricultural irrigation in about 80{\%} of the sites, while it was found that the indices of SAR, SSP, RSC, PI, and TH for all sites were suitable and safe for irrigation. As a result of this study, it has been determined that groundwater in the study area is unsuitable for agricultural irrigation. For sustainable groundwater exploitation, it is advised that a continuous water-quality-monitoring program should be implemented, as well as the development of suitable management practices.},

@phdthesis{Gibson2018,
abstract = {Given current and continued investment in irrigation scheduling technologies, a need exists to better estimate the longevity and magnitude of water savings at watershed level to avoid the paradox of irrigation efficiency. This paradox occurs within a watershed as not all irrigation inefficiencies lead to the system losing water. For example, irrigation pumping rates in excess of crop water demand may lead to enhanced groundwater recharge or surface runoff that migrates to a stream. Thus, increases in efficiency may not lead to similar magnitudes of water savings. I hypothesize that water savings longevities are short given previous work demonstrating rapid responses of groundwater recharge rates to changing surface conditions. To test this hypothesis, I used numerical modeling and hydrogeological field techniques. This work provides localized ranges of: weather, management, soil variability, depth to groundwater, and water fluxes. In chapter two, utilizing a crop modeling and numerical modeling of soil moisture redistribution, I found that irrigation practices within the study area could be reduced by 120 mm yr–1 with impact on yield less than 3{\%} when compared to a long-term dataset of irrigation pumping rates for {\~{}}50 fields within the study area. From work in chapter three, I found that sampling locations informed via repeat hydrogeophysical surveys, required only five cores to reduce the cross-validation root mean squared error by an average of 64{\%} as compared to soil parameters predicted by a commonly used benchmark, SSURGO and ROSETTA. This work then informed an intermediate core sampling framework in chapter four to constrain how soil hydraulic fluxes vary on subfield scale. In chapter four, I compared deep drainage outputs of a numerical model parameterized with localized measurements to a chemical tracer analysis and find agreement within 80{\%} despite a wide range of fluxes observed (135–515mm yr–1). Scenario testing informed using the parameterized numerical model and the irrigation reduction potential from chapter two indicated that a 120mm yr–1  reduction of pumping leads to modest water savings (1–3 years; 50–200mm over 10 years). However, when applied over a number of fields, similar irrigation efficiency programs may be competitive with other water resource management programs.},

abstract = {The consumption of contaminated water is a major source of heavy metal contamination in humans and animals. This study therefore aimed to assess Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn levels in water used for human and animal consumption and vegetable crop irrigation in Camocim de Săo F{\'{e}}lix, Pernambuco, Brazil. Water samples were collected on the studied farms from an artesian well and reservoirs used for human and animal consumption as well as for crop irrigation. The results showed that concentrations of Cd ({\textgreater} 0.001 mg L-1), Ni ({\textgreater} 0.025 mg L-1) and Pb ({\textgreater} 0.01 mg L-1) were above the maximum allowable limits established under Brazilian law, indicating the need for a preventive monitoring program and immediate intervention initiatives aimed at the sources of contamination. The results demonstrate the need to quantify heavy metal content in vegetable crops, since their contamination by irrigation water may make them harmful to human health. Rainfall has a seasonal effect on heavy metal concentrations in water, showing a significant effect on Pb levels, whereas Cd and Ni content was less dependent on seasonal variation.Alternate abstract:O consumo de {\'{a}}guas contaminadas representa uma das principais vias de contamina{\c{c}}{\^{a}}o humana e animal por metais pesados.

abstract = {Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a crop known for its tolerance to abiotic stress such as drought and salinity. Quinoa is also a versatile superfood, which is gluten-free and high in protein, vitamins, nutrients, and beneficial antioxidants. Washington State University's quinoa breeding program efforts focus on identification and development of varieties that are resilient to local environmental conditions. In this study, high-throughput phenotyping techniques were applied to evaluate the performance of quinoa varieties under different irrigation regimes. Handheld multispectral radiometer (Crop Scan), proximal sensing system using ground platform, and remote sensing with unmanned aerial system (UAS) were used to assess the performance of eight quinoa varieties under two irrigation treatments (non-irrigated and irrigated). Crop Scan data, along with multispectral and thermal infrared images, were acquired at multiple time points at different stages of crop development during the season. In general, the normalized difference vegetation index, water band index, and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) data extracted from Crop Scan, and GNDVI and canopy temperature data extracted from UAS were able to detect irrigation treatment effects. Comparing the spectral data acquired at multiple scales indicated that Crop Scan data were highly and significantly correlated with remote sensing data (|r| = 0.57–0.85). Rapid data acquisition and the ability to detect differences among varieties under water stress highlight the application of remote sensing techniques as a high-throughput phenotyping tool to evaluate quinoa.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDSimple modifications of typical rural house design can be an effective and relatively inexpensive method of reducing indoor mosquito vector densities and consequently decreasing malaria transmission. Public health scientists have shown the potential for house design to protect people against malaria, yet this type of intervention remains virtually ignored. A randomized-controlled study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the effects of this method of vector control on the density of indoor resting malaria vectors in a rice irrigation scheme area in lowlands of western Kenya.METHODSTen treatment houses were modified with ceilings of papyrus mats and insecticide-treated netting (ITN) and tested against ten control houses without papyrus ceilings. To determine densities of mosquitoes resting in homes, the pyrethrum spray method was used to simultaneously collect indoor resting malaria vectors in intervention and control houses. Each house was sampled a total of eight times over a period of four months, resulting in a total of 80 sampling efforts for each treatment. Community response to such intervention was investigated by discussions with residents.RESULTSPapyrus mats ceiling modification reduced house entry by Anopheles gambiae s.l and Anopheles funestus densities by between 78-80{\%} and 86{\%} respectively compared to unmodified houses. Geometric mean density of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus in modified houses were significantly lower (t(18) = 7.174, P {\textless} 0.0001 and t(18) = 2.52, P = 0.02, respectively) compared to controls. Unmodified houses were associated with relatively higher densities of malaria vectors. There was a 84{\%} (OR 0.16, 95{\%} CI 0.07-0.39, P {\textless} 0.0001) and 87{\%} (OR 0.13, 95{\%} CI 0.03-0.5, P = 0.0004) reduction in the odds of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus presence in modified houses, respectively, compared with unmodified houses. Residents responded favourably to this mode of vector control.CONCLUSIONHouse modifications involving insect screen ceilings made from locally available materials and small ITN incorporated in house construction have the potential to reduce human exposure to malaria vectors, and thus parasite infection, in a rice irrigation scheme area of western Kenya. Ceiling modification is likely to be acceptable and is expected to be of greatest benefit when used in combination with other malaria control strategies.},

abstract = {Increasing food production by developing small-scale irrigation schemes is a requirement for tackling household food insecurity. Strategies, such as the World Vision, Enhancing Nutrition, Stepping Up Resilience and Enterprise, have been established to enhance food availability in the drought-prone Burirano Ward 4, Chipinge, Zimbabwe, through the drip irrigation intervention. This study analysed the extent to which the drip intervention has increased food production, abilities, income and nutrition of households. Consequently, the key factors impacting the performance of the drip irrigation scheme were assessed. The study utilised a mixed-method convergent parallel design, drawing from semi-structured questionnaires administered on a census of 40 household beneficiaries as well as a focus group discussion of five key informants directly linked to the Chidzadza irrigation scheme, Burirano Ward 4, Chipinge, Zimbabwe. The findings show that the drip irrigation scheme significantly increased households' food production abilities, nutrition and income. The main factors responsible for the success of the drip irrigation scheme are cheap labour from household members and agriculture extension support. Issues that prevent the success of the scheme include erratic rain supplies and damaged water pipes. Strategies to increase household food production through the drip irrigation scheme include maintenance of water pipes, an increase in water catchment areas and water availability through solar-powered borehole systems.},

abstract = {Good governance is a prerequisite for better management of common‐use resources. Awareness of institutions, inclusion of members in decision‐making processes, stakeholder engagement and transparency are needed for good governance, which enhances the sustainable use of communal water resources. This paper therefore considers perceptions of farmers on irrigation scheme governance in its various dimensions. The study uses household data of 341 farmers drawn from four irrigation schemes in KwaZulu‐Natal. The results show that farmers who are satisfied with the informal institutions, being the rules and norms set locally to govern the scheme farmers, value the involvement of the tribal authorities in scheme management, including their contribution to rule enforcement. Age, agricultural training, water adequacy, participation in scheme activities, psychological capital and land tenure have a positive effect on perceptions of governance constructs. Farmers are satisfied with the informal institutions governing the schemes and therefore the study recommends the inclusion of informal institutions in policy formulation. Farmers should be empowered through training and be made aware of formal institutions applicable to their irrigation scheme, and stakeholder engagement in the schemes should be strengthened.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Une bonne gouvernance est une condition pr{\'{e}}alable {\`{a}} une meilleure gestion des ressources d'usage commun.

abstract = {Rural areas worldwide are witnessing an increase in outmigration, which has led to an impact on irrigation infrastructure management. In many cases, governments in transition economies find it difficult to support small-scale irrigation infrastructure programs. This research aims to examine the extent to which the recent “lineage revival” in China to increase the importance of lineage networks can reduce the negative effects of outmigration in rural communities. Analyzing a rural community in Sichuan Province, the findings reveal that while there is no significant effect of outmigration on respondents' willingness to contribute toward irrigation infrastructure, and while lineage networks can enhance this willingness, such networks also reduce participation if non-lineage members are among the beneficiaries. Finally, the study provides an understanding of how informal lineage networks may facilitate contribution to irrigation infrastructure.},

Sous ce theme, la question 58s'intitulait 'Comment est-ce que l'irrigation et le drainage jouent un role important dans l'adaptation au changement climatique?' Le present document resume les conclusions et les discussions resultats de 48 communications et 27 posters acceptes dans le cadre de cette question. Ce tour d'horizon confirme le role de la gestion de l'irrigation et du drainage pour attenuer les impacts du changement climatique, et montre que les evenements climatiques extremes ont a etre pris en compte dans tous les processus de prise de decision. Il souligne egalement qu'une attention particuliere doit etre portee aux incertitudes de l'evaluation du changement climatique, et que cette evaluation devrait etre plus fiable avec le developpement de meilleures methodes d'analyse et une plus grande disponibilite de donnees climatiques fiables et de scenarios prospectifs. A ce stade, il est tres difficile de faire une evaluation integree de l'impact, qui couvre l'ensemble du processus agricole et hydrologique, a toutes les echelles et pour tous les aspects, de l'exploitation agricole au bassin hydrographique, du developpement vegetal aux systemes d'exploitation agricole, de la production a l'environnement, etc. Par consequent, chaque sous-processus est a evaluer, et la consolidation des resultats et de cas doit etre encouragee.},

abstract = {The 22nd International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage with the main theme 'Securing Water for Food and Rural Community under Climate Change' was held in September 2014 in Gwangju, Korea. Under this theme, Congress Question 58 'How do Irrigation and Drainage Play an Important Role in Climate Change Adaptation?' was raised. This paper summarizes the discussions and results of 48 papers and 27 posters accepted under this question.              This overview confirms the role of irrigation and drainage management as intervention to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and consequent extreme climate events have to be factored into all decision-making processes. It also highlights that particular attention should be paid to the uncertainty in climate change assessment and that the assessment is expected to be more dependable with the development of better analysis methods and a greater availability of reliable climate data and future scenarios.              At this stage, it is very hard to do an integrated impact assessment, which covers the whole agricultural and hydrological process, including all scales and aspects such as on-farm to basin, crop growth to farming system, production to environment, etc. Therefore, each sub-process is to be evaluated and accumulation of its outcomes and cases promoted.

abstract = {Deficit irrigation practices and utilization of rootstocks that are tolerant to water stress are critical strategies for the protection of water resources and sustainable irrigation management, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the yield and quality of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions during 2017 and 2018 in the Konya Plain of Turkey, where the semi-arid climate is prevalent. In this study, five different plant materials, such as citroides1 (A1), citroides2 (A2), gourd (A3), hybrid TZ148 (A4) rootstocks grafted with the Crimson Tide variety, and non-grafted Crimson Tide as control (K1), were used as the main-plots. Five different irrigation levels, calculated by taking into account the amounts of cumulative water (Ep) that evaporated at 7-day intervals from Class A Pan (I100 = 1.00Ep; I75 = 0.75Ep; I50 = 0.50Ep; I35 = 0.35Ep, and I0 = rain-fed), were used as the sub-plots. When the average of experimental years was considered, the highest rate of evapotranspiration (ET) was found in the plot A4I100 (615 mm). The highest fruit yield was obtained from the A4I100 (93.4 t/ha), and an increase in yield of up to 35 {\%} was achieved in the A4I100, compared to non-grafted plants applied I100 irrigation level (K1I100). The analysis of data by both separate evaluation and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the yield values obtained from plants grafted onto A4, A1, and A2 rootstocks applied I75 irrigation level were higher than non-grafted plants applied I100 irrigation level. The water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) ranged between 7.1–17.4 kg/m3 and 11.7–25.0 kg/m3, respectively, and a significant increase in the values of WP and IWP was achieved by grafting. This two-year study revealed that the performances of citron watermelon rootstocks were found close to the TZ148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield, certain yield components, WP, and IWP. Thus, it has also been demonstrated that the citron watermelons could be used commercially as watermelon rootstocks, and citron watermelon rootstocks could be used as watermelon rootstocks in breeding programs, in order to save water, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.},

abstract = {Aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions —where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction. To tackle this problem, policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies. However, these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction. Estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time-consuming because they vary depending on technology- and location-specific conditions, and their interactions. Thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates, even if rough. This paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies. Our case study is the aquifer of Valle de Aguascalientes, Mexico —where extraction is more than 80{\%} above of the natural recharge. We have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft. These results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in Aguascalientes. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of irrigation is essential for ensuring food and water security, and to cope with the scarcity of water resources, which is expected to exacerbate under the pressure of climate change and population increase. Even though irrigation is likely the most important direct human intervention in the hydrological cycle, we have only partial knowledge on the areas of our planet in which irrigation takes place, and almost no information on the amount of water that is applied for irrigation. In this study, we developed a new approach exploiting satellite soil moisture observations for quantifying the amount of water applied for irrigation. Through the inversion of the soil water balance equation, and by using satellite soil moisture products as input, the amount of water entering into the soil, and hence irrigation, is determined. Through synthetic experiments, we first assessed the impact of soil moisture measurement uncertainty and temporal resolution, also as a function of climate, on the accuracy of the method. Second, we applied the proposed approach to currently available coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2). Nine pilot sites in Europe, USA, Australia and Africa were used as case study to test the method in a real-world application. The synthetic experiment showed that the method is able to quantify irrigation, with satisfactory performance from satellite data with retrieval errors lower than ∼0.04 m³/m³ and revisit times shorter than 3 days. In the case studies based on real satellite data, qualitative assessments (due to missing in situ irrigation observations) showed that over regions in which satellite soil moisture products perform well, and which are characterized by prolonged periods without rainfall, the method shows good results in quantifying irrigation. However, at sites in which rainfall is sustained throughout the year, the proposed method fails in obtaining reliable performances. Similarly, low performances are obtained in areas where satellite products uncertainties are too large, or their spatial resolution is too coarse with respect to the size of the irrigated fields.},

abstract = {Surface water quality is critical for regional and local community needs in Grouz Dam basin, NE Algeria. Subsequently, this research was assessed out to analyze the surface water suitability for drinking and irrigation and also aims to measure the degree of the hydrochemical implications to the sustainable control of water resources in this basin. Throughout this study, the aptness of surface waters for domestic use was assessed via evaluating the physicochemical levels with the recommended values for potable water settled by the WHO and water quality index. The values of the considered parameters are below the maximum tolerable limits for drinking except for Na+, NO32−, Fe, Cu, Al and turbidity. The suitability for irrigation was appraised using multiple agricultural water quality indicators like SAR, Na{\%} and RSC. The ionic dominance in water changed into descending order of Na+  {\textgreater} Ca2+  {\textgreater} Mg2+  {\textgreater} K+ for cations and of Cl− {\textgreater} (HCO3− + CO32− {\textgreater} SO42− {\textgreater} NO3− for anions and, in all waters, two facies were determined. The hydrochemical analysis divulges that weathering and dissolution additionally to the anthropogenic activity are the dominant hydrogeochemical processes governing and/ or influencing water chemistry in Grouz Dam Basin. The overall surface waters are good for irrigation use and presenting a low salinity hazard but unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the surface water quality and to implement and formulate an integrated plan to control the level of anthropogenic occurring contamination. It is recommended to carry out a systematic water quality monitoring program and development of effective management practices for water resources utilization in order to their best protection and sustainable preservation in this region of Algeria.},

abstract = {In order to characterize, classify and evaluate the suitability of Medjerda River water for irrigation, a hydrochemical assessment was conducted. It accounts for 80 {\%} of the total Tunisian surface water. In this paper, hydrographical methods and PHREEQC geochemical program were used to characterize water quality of Medjerda River, whereas its suitability for irrigation was determined in accordance with its electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium concentrations. It was established that the water samples were undersaturated with calcite, dolomite, aragonite, anhydrite, gypsum and halite except in one water sample which is supersaturated with carbonate minerals. The quality assessment of Medjerda River for irrigation purposes showed that some points belonged to the excellent-to-good and good-to-permissible irrigation water categories, while the remaining ones were classified as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation making the river water use limited to plants with high salt tolerance. Moreover, based on FAO guidelines, almost all water samples may cause immediate salinity to gradual increasing problem but no soil infiltration problems except for two sampling points. However, immediate development or possible increasing of severe toxicity problems may be caused by the continuous use of this water for irrigation due to troublesome concentrations of chloride and sodium.},

abstract = {The Mazar-i-Sharif city is part of the Balkh province, north of Afghanistan, and its groundwater resources are developed for water supply and irrigation purposes. The main lithological units consist chiefly of evaporite, conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and loess. In order to evaluate the quality of groundwater in the study area, 28 samples were collected and analyzed for various ions. Chemical indices like sodium adsorption ratio, the percentage of sodium, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were calculated. Based on the analytical results, groundwater in the area is generally very hard, brackish, high to very high saline, and alkaline in nature. The abundance of the major ions is as follows: Cl− {\textgreater} HCO3− {\textgreater} SO42− {\textgreater} NO3− and Na+ {\textgreater} Ca2+ {\textgreater} Mg2+ {\textgreater} K+. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater is the Na–Cl type, and alkalis (Na+, K+) and strong acids (Cl−, SO42−) are slightly dominating over alkali earths (Ca2+, Mg2+) and weak acids (HCO3−, CO32−). About 67{\%} of the samples were showing a high concentration of nitrate, exceeding permissible limit of WHO (50 mg/l). The sources of NO3− in the study area are anthropogenic activities (domestic wastewater infiltration from the cesspits) and intense agricultural practices in nearby areas (Balkh district) of the city that utilize nitrogen and sulfate fertilizers. The chemical quality of groundwater is related to the dissolution of minerals, ion exchange, anthropogenic activities, and the residence time of the groundwater in contact with rock materials. The results of calculation saturation index by computer program PHREEQC show that nearly all of the water samples were supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) and under-saturated with respect to sulfate minerals (gypsum and anhydrite). Assessment of water samples from various methods indicated that groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for drinking and agricultural uses.},

abstract = {Smallholder agriculture shares a great portion of Sri Lanka's economy and provides a livelihood to 20{\%} of the country's labour force. However, smallholder agricultural systems are considered highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. As such, improving their climate resilience is critical to ensuring sustainable development of the country. In the country's dry zone, agricultural systems are supported by thousands of small and large irrigation tanks in cascades, whose water supply potential keeps fluctuating widely between years and seasons due to rainfall variability which is a unique characteristic of this zone. In this study, we assessed the hydrological potential of the catchments of these tanks in a typical irrigation system and provided a framework to design an optimal strategy to enhance climate resilience of such systems for improved agricultural production, using a water balance model. The results show that climate-induced impacts on hydrology coupled with population growth and agricultural expansion increase irrigation water demands in the near future. Moreover, demand-side interventions will be more effective than supply-side adaptation in reducing the demand-supply gap. The study recommends evaluating more adaptation measures under expert guidance, uncertainty assessments of future climate and socio-economic pathways, and incorporating a cost-benefit assessment in the model.},

abstract = {Considerable NO3− contamination of underlying aquifers is associated with greenhouse-based vegetable production in south-eastern Spain, where 80{\%} of cropping occurs in soil. To identify management factors likely to contribute to NO3− leaching from soil-based cropping, a survey of irrigation and N management practices was conducted in 53 commercial greenhouses. For each greenhouse: (i) a questionnaire of general irrigation and N management practices was completed, (ii) amounts of N applied in manure were estimated; and for one crop in each greenhouse: (a) irrigation volume was compared with ETc calculated using a mathematical model and (b) total amount of applied fertiliser N was compared with crop N uptake. Total irrigation during the first 6 weeks after transplanting/sowing was generally excessive, being {\textgreater}150 and {\textgreater}200{\%} of modelled ETc in, respectively, 68 and 60{\%} of greenhouses. During the subsequent period, applied irrigation was generally similar to modelled ETc, with only 12{\%} of greenhouses applying {\textgreater}150{\%} of modelled ETc. Large irrigations prior to transplanting/sowing were applied in 92{\%} of greenhouses to leach salts and moisten soil. Volumes applied were {\textgreater}20 and {\textgreater}40mm in, respectively, 69 and 42{\%} of greenhouses. Chemical soil disinfectants had been recently applied in 43{\%} of greenhouses; associated irrigation volumes were {\textgreater}20 and {\textgreater}40mm in, respectively, 78 and 48{\%} of greenhouses conducting disinfection. Nitrogen and irrigation management were generally based on experience, with very little use of soil or plant analysis. Large manure applications were made at greenhouse construction in 98{\%} of greenhouse, average manure and N application rates were, respectively, 432m3ha−1 and 3046kgNha−1. Periodic manure applications were made in 68{\%} of greenhouses, average application rates for farmyard and pelleted manures were, respectively, 157 and 13m3ha−1 (in 55 and 13{\%} of greenhouses); the average N rate was 947kgNha−1. Manure N was not considered in N fertiliser programs in 74{\%} of greenhouses. On average, 75{\%} of fertiliser N was applied as NO3−. Applied fertiliser N was {\textgreater}1.5 and {\textgreater}2 times crop N uptake in, respectively, 42 and 21{\%} of crops surveyed. The survey identified various management practices likely to contribute to NO3− leaching loss. Large manure applications and experiential mineral N management practices, based on NO3− application, are likely to cause accumulation of soil NO3−. Drainage associated with: (i) the combined effect of large irrigations immediately prior to and excessive irrigations for several weeks following transplanting/sowing and (ii) large irrigations for salt leaching and soil disinfection, is likely to leach accumulated NO3− from the root zone. This study demonstrated that surveys can be very useful diagnostic tools for identifying crop management practices, on commercial farms, that are likely to contribute to appreciable NO3− leaching.},

abstract = {The present study was conducted as a greenhouse study under {\c{C}}ukurova conditions during the years2011-2012. Two different dent corn lines (5A2-B and 22K) were used as the plant material of the experiments. Crop water stress index (CWSI) values determined through leaf canopy temperature measurements performed ahead of irrigations were used to find outwater use efficiencies. Experiments were conducted in randomized blocks-split plots experimental design with three replications. Drip irrigation was used for irrigations and two different irrigation programs were created as of I100(supplying 100{\%} of depleted water in every seven days) and I75(applying 75{\%} of depleted water. The amount of irrigation water applied for in the interaction of I100irrigation and corn lines (5A2-B and22K) in the first and second year were respectively varied between 253.0-274.0and between 238.0-261.0mm, seasonal plant water consumptions varied between 294.0-305.0and between 284.6-302.6 mm, kernel yields varied between 2950.0-2990.0 and between 3130.0-3186.0kgha-1. With regard to (in the interaction irrigation treatments xcorn lines), the lowest and the highest CWSI values were observed in the interaction full irrigation (I100) and of the line 22K as 0.22 and in deficit irrigation treatment (I75) of the line 5A2-B as 0.41in the first year; in full irrigation treatment (I100) of the line 22K as 0.20 and in deficit irrigation treatment (I75) of the line 5A2-B as 0.36. The greatest and the lowest chlorophyll contents (in the interaction irrigation treatments x corn lines) were respectively observed in I100treatment of the line 22K as 58.3 spad and in I75treatment of the line 5A2-Bas 50.9 spad in the first year; in I100treatment of the line 22K as 59.1 SPAD and in I75treatment of the line 5A2-B as 55.1 spad. While the effects of irrigation treatments on average dry matter contents of the lines were not found to be significant, significant differences were observed in water use efficiency and kernel yield of dent corn lines (p{\textless}0.01). Current findings revealed that 22K dent corn line was prominent with regard to CWSI and chlorophyll content and the relevant line was also able to use available water holding capacity with an optimum efficiency. Therefore, it was concluded that the dent corn line (22K) could be used in further researches to improve water efficiencies.},

abstract = {Investments in irrigation systems have been shown to substantially improve farmers' productivity, and thus alleviate poverty. This study provides an example of such an investment: the Participatory Small-Scale Irrigation Development Programme. The project institutionalized water user associations, developed small-scale irrigation schemes, and provided agricultural training activities to smallholder farmers in drought-prone and food-deficit areas in four regions of Ethiopia. Combining a primary household survey with geographical data, this work estimates the project impact on agricultural production and household expenditure using a novel identification strategy. Beneficiaries' gains include improved crop yields and greater diversity of crops cultivated. These gains have the potential to raise revenues and enable a switch from subsistence to purchasing more food from the market. The lessons learned from this study, by highlighting the need to focus on strengthening access to market, in conjunction with the irrigation infrastructural support, have the potential to improve the design and implementation of future small-scale irrigation projects. The added focus on access to markets would provide greater opportunities to projects beneficiaries by maximising farmers' improved productive capacity.},

abstract = {Mealybugs are serious insect pests in Tunisian vineyards where they can cause major production losses. Thus, a management program of these insects is a priority for grape growers. A summer pesticide trial was conducted in a vineyard, located in the Cap-Bon Region of Tunisia. The trial was carried out to assess the use of imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide, against mealybugs on vine. Imidacloprid was applied through the drip irrigation system for each vine and was then compared to methidathion, a contact insecticide. Imidacloprid was found to be more effective than methidathion on all mealybug developmental stages. In addition to its outstanding, up to 100{\%} efficiency, imidacloprid provided an interesting long-term control of mealybugs. No significant difference was found between the two imidacloprid rates (1 and 2 ml/vine). Methidathion generated an overall low to intermediate efficacy on mealybugs and was more effective on both first instar nymphs and adult females than on the other mealybug developmental stages. Thus, imidacloprid applied through a drip irrigation system is a new promising option to control mealybugs in vineyards. For this reason it can be employed in an integrated management program against these pests in the Tunisian grape-growing area.},

abstract = {Pakistan is an agrarian economy. It has the world's largest contiguous irrigation system which was designed to provide uninterrupted supplies of irrigation water for its agriculture sector. The irrigation network of the Punjab was initially designed for 67 percent cropping intensity. But presently actual irrigation intensity has increased to 122 percent, showing that the system is already overburdened. Irrigation network in Punjab was developed for effective and efficient management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, equitable distribution of available canal supplies at head, middle and tail end reaches, control of illegal water abstractions and revenue generation through efficient assessment of water fees. But various studies showed that system had lost its efficiency over time. It was found that the irrigation performance needs to be reviewed in the context of system design objectives, operational constraints, institutional systems and the broader socio-economic framework. In this scenario a comprehensive reform program has been introduced in the irrigation sector financed by World Bank and other international financial institutions. Basic aim of the whole reform program is to delegate the system to the ultimate users so that they can efficiently manage the system and increasing the water as well as agricultural productivity. Consequently, management was transferred to the farmers under the PIDA Act, 1997. In the present study, a sample of 360 farmers and 30 farmer Organizations were collected through a multistage sampling technique. Econometric analysis was carried out by applying 'Before and After" technique to assess the impact of the reform process on rice productivity and income in the study area. The results of the study showed that rice productivity and income increased after introduction of irrigation reforms in the study area.},

Results include a statistical analysis of the impact of 2,000 residential sprinkler audits in Colorado and guidance for future conservation program design. Analysis of water billing records from at least two years pre- and two years post-irrigation audit from five seasons (2007–2012) were used to answer key questions about irrigation audit impact on water use as well as to understand factors that contribute to water savings from irrigation programs. While the average water savings one year post-audit were 5,000 gal/participant and median savings were 2,000 gal/participant, high variability among savings beyond one year suggests that audits may not produce as robust long-term benefits.},

abstract = {The easy accessibility of groundwater in the alluvial plains of the Kosi river basin has considerably altered the crop calendar and farmers' irrigation response, especially in the dry years after 2004. The present study attempts to develop a framework for analyzing the spatio-temporal variation in the groundwater recharge/ extraction pattern as well as river and aquifer flux exchange due to increasing anthropogenic activities in the basin. The influence of anthropogenic activities over groundwater recharge/extraction statistics has been discussed in Laveti et al. (2021). The estimated groundwater recharge (Laveti et al., 2021) along with aquifer characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and specific storage), and riverbed conductance were used as inputs to the groundwater flow transient model in the study. The model observed, an increasing groundwater dependency for agricultural activities, results in a continuous increase of flux from the river to the aquifer. Between 1997 and 2010, the river to aquifer flux increased by almost 1{\%} of the average river discharge. This increase in river to aquifer flux exchange was evident, especially during the dry periods after 2004, which coincided with the government's Million Shallow Tube Well Programme (MSTP) in the basin. The increasing trend of the river to aquifer flux transfer and the decreasing trend of the aquifer to river flux transfer observed in the Kosi basin can have disturbing long-term effects in terms of reduced river flow and river stage. Therefore, the concerned authorities and the stakeholders must take immediate notice of the observations.},

abstract = {The contamination of pathogenic bacteria through irrigation water is a recognized risk factor for fresh produce. Irrigation water disinfection is an intervention strategy that could be applied to reduce the probability of microbiological contamination of crops. Disinfection treatments should be applied ensuring minimum effective doses, which are efficient in inhibiting the microbial contamination while avoiding formation and accumulation of chemical residues. Among disinfection technologies available for growers, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) represents, after sodium hypochlorite, an alternative disinfection treatment, which is commercially applied by growers in the USA and Spain. However, in most of the cases, the suitability of this treatment has been tested against pathogenic bacteria and low attention have been given to the impact of chemical residues on the bacterial community of the vegetable tissue. The aim of this study was to (i) to evaluate the continual application of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a water disinfection treatment of irrigation water during baby spinach growth in commercial production open fields, and (ii) to determine the subsequent impact of these treatments on the bacterial communities in water, soil, and baby spinach. To gain insight into the changes in the bacterial community elicited by ClO2, samples of treated and untreated irrigation water as well as the irrigated soil and baby spinach were analyzed using Miseq{\textregistered} Illumina sequencing platform. Next generation sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis revealed that ClO2 treatment of irrigation water did not affect the diversity of the bacterial community of water, soil and crop, but significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of specific bacterial genera. This demonstrates the different susceptibility of the bacteria genera to the ClO2 treatment. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that the phyllosphere bacterial community of baby spinach was more influenced by the soil bacteria community rather than that of irrigation water. In the case of baby spinach, the use of low residual ClO2 concentrations (approx. 0.25 mg/L) to treat irrigation water decreased the relative abundance of Pseudomondaceae (2.28-fold) and Enterobacteriaceae (2.5-fold) when comparing treated versus untreated baby spinach. Members of these two bacterial families are responsible for food spoilage and foodborne illnesses. Therefore, a reduction of these bacterial families might be beneficial for the crop and for food safety. In general it can be concluded that the constant application of ClO2 as a disinfection treatment for irrigation water only caused changes in two bacterial families of the baby spinach and soil microbiota, without affecting the major phyla and classes. The significance of these changes in the bacterial community should be further evaluated.},

The focus of the present review is to elucidate the different ways how these human interventions may have an effect on population dynamics of anopheline mosquitoes and hence, how local malaria transmission patterns may be changed. We discuss different studies within the three main tropical and sub-tropical regions (namely Africa, Asia and the Pacific and the Americas). Factors such as pre-human impact malaria epidemiological patterns, control measures, demographic movements, human behaviour and local Anopheles bionomics would determine if the implementation of an irrigation scheme or a dam will have negative effects on human health. Some examples of successful implementation of control measures in such settings are presented. The use of Geographic Information System as a powerful tool to assist on the study and control of malaria in these scenarios is also highlighted.},

abstract = {Water availability from the Ogallala Aquifer is declining in the Oklahoma Panhandle, resulting in dwindling pumping capacities, and the need for water use efficiency. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) is a more efficient irrigation system that could be adopted by producers in this region if various management related questions could be addressed. One such question is how crop row placement will impact crop performance, irrigation water use efficiency and yield under SDI. Therefore, a study was established at the Oklahoma Panhandle Research and Extension Center in which drip tape is buried on 152.4 cm rows, allowing two crop rows planted on 76.2 cm to be irrigated with one tape. Corn and Sorghum rows will be offset from equidistance from the drip tape by 0, 8, 15, 23, and 38 cm. This resulted in 5 treatments with 4 replicates. A GPS system will be used to place rows at the offsets mentioned above. For each crop this treatment structure will be imposed on 3 irrigation regimes. Irrigation will be applied to replace 100{\%} of evapotranspiration as determined by the Mesonet irrigation program as well as 75{\%} and 50{\%} of this rate. This project found that offset did not impact sorghum yield. Also, no significant impact on corn grain yield was observed, however, at the 50{\%} irrigation regime a 10{\%} reduction in average yield was observed. This data suggests that SDI can be successful regardless of access to high precision guidance systems.},

abstract = {In Poland, under conditions of the moderate climate and transition between maritime and continental climates, the average rainfall totals of the growing season are in the range of 350–400 mm; however, they are distinguished by great temporal and spatial variability. Climatological studies demonstrate that the drought frequency is approximately 30{\%}. Therefore, under such conditions, irrigation has a supplementary and intervention nature and is applied only when dry periods occur. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of sprinkler irrigation and increased nitrogen fertilization on the yield and quality of sugar beet roots and yield of sugar. The average increase of the yield under irrigation was 18.1 t{\textperiodcentered}ha⁻¹ which constituted a 22.8{\%} increase in the yield. Furthermore, there was a marked tendency of a higher sugar content in the roots of irrigated plants. The absolute, relative, and unit average sugar beet root yield increases obtained under the influence of sprinkler irrigation and the lack of a significant diversity in the sugar content in roots confirm that irrigation contributed to an appropriate pace of plant growth and development. The increased rate of nitrogen fertilization (N2) of 160 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha⁻¹ plus an additional 40 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha⁻¹ resulted in the significantly greater root yields compared to the control (N1) (160 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha⁻¹), i.e., an average of 7.6 t{\textperiodcentered}ha⁻¹ (9{\%}). Based on the crop-water production function, the maximum root yields were obtained for the N1 rate at a total precipitation and irrigation amount of 382 mm, compared with 367 mm for the N2 rate.},

abstract = {Because of the importance of agriculture to Florida's economy, and the federal and state water quality legislation, Florida's vegetable growers need specific guidelines to comply with these new regulations and remain competitive. Regulators also need science-based data documenting the reduction in pollution achieved by implementation of Best Management Practices. To better understand the impact of irrigation-nutrient management programs (INMP) on fresh market tomato production, simultaneous experiments were conducted to determine the effects of INMPs on (1) tomato yields, (2) tomato seasonal total-N load, and (3) economic insights into tomato production as determined with partial budget analysis (PBA). A 2-year experiment was conducted at Live Oak, Florida during springs of 2005 and 2006 with selected INMPs created by a combination of preplant fertilizer source (Chicken Litter (CL) or 13-1.8-10.8), fertilizer rate (100{\%} or 200{\%}), and irrigation rate (100{\%} or 300{\%}). The University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) recommended INMP was 100{\%} Fertigation-100{\%} Irrigation.    CL as a preplant nutrient source increased early-yields, and did not differ significantly from the UF/IFAS INMP for nutrient loads. 300{\%} INMP reduced total fruit yields (920-1242 25-lb cartons/acre), but did not differ significantly from the UF/IFAS INMP for nutrient loads. Based on the PBA, relative to the UF/IFAS INMP, 300{\%} INMP not only increased the cost of the program ({\$}17.18/acre), but also resulted in reduced returns ({\$}1701/acre-{\$}4112/acre). The effects of 200{\%} fertigation rate on tomato plants varied with year. Early and total tomato yields with UF/IFAS and 200{\%} INMP were not significantly different in both years. The high fertigation alone INMP (200{\%} Fertigation-100{\%} Irrigation) resulted in highest total-N load in 2006. Though statistically not significant, it also resulted in numerical higher net returns relative to the UF/IFAS INMP ({\$}55/acre-{\$}561/acre. We can conclude that CL can be used as an alternative preplant fertilizer source. We can also conclude that growers should not use high irrigation/high fertigation-high irrigation rates to ensure adequate soil moisture levels in the crop root zone as it results in net losses relative to the UF/IFAS INMP. Instead, they should better manage irrigation water application.},

Therefore, two field experiments were conducted in a strip plot design including three replicates in the 2019 and 2020 summer seasons at Sakha Agricultural Research Station, Agricultural Research Centre, Egypt, to investigate the effect of three irrigation levels (I0 (100{\%}), I1 (90{\%}), and I2 (80{\%})), and six weed control treatments of pendimethalin (T1), oxyfluorfen (T2), bentazon + clethodim (T3), imazethapyr (T4), hand-hoeing twice (T5), and untreated check (T6) on annual weeds, physiological traits, water relations, and yield and its components of soybean cv Giza 111. Results indicated that intermediate irrigation levels lead to the highest yield and economic return, while the herbicide program that resulted in the greatest weed control gave the highest yield. The rate of weed infestation in field experiments was 19.7 and 21.8 t ha−1 dry weights, which decreased soybean yield by 56.9 and 57.1{\%}, compared to treatment (T4).

abstract = {Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Ethiopian economy. However, the sector is affected by climate change induced extreme weather events that aggravates rural poverty. As a result, the Ethiopian government has been making different interventions to alleviate poverty. Koga irrigation development project (KIDP) is one of such initiatives. However, due to political unrest, poor water management practice, limited market linkages and other institutional challenges, the project has not reached its desired goals. This paper is thus intended to evaluate the efficacy of the KIDP to reduce poverty. Data were collected from 395 sample farm households (220 irrigators and 175 non-irrigators) drawn using multi-stage sampling technique. Multidimensional poverty index and endogenous switching regression model were employed to measure poverty and estimate the impact of irrigation on household poverty, respectively. The study found that poverty intensity and multidimensional poverty index of the study area were lower than the national and regional averages. Nonetheless, the trend of poverty reduction was not evenly progressed in irrigator and non-irrigator households. The proportion of non-irrigator poor and MPI poor households were greater than irrigators. The endogenous switching model and key informant interviews proved that irrigation has positive impact on multidimensional household poverty reduction. However, the incidence of poverty among the sample households, regardless of access to irrigation, is still higher. This implies access to irrigation should be accompanied by institutional supports and complementary production inputs. So as to excel the impact of irrigation, the government shall also expand the technology over non-irrigated areas.},

abstract = {The tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), is the most important insect pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), in Mississippi. This research project was initiated to gain a better understanding of selected crop production factors that can improve tarnished plant bug integrated pest management. Results suggest that irrigation strategies and varietal pubescence can significantly influence tarnished plant bug management in cotton. Most notably, delaying irrigation for as long as possible and planting hairy varieties can minimize the impact of tarnished plant bug on cotton yields and reduce the number of insecticides needed to manage this pest. Additionally, these results show that tarnished plant bug management is most critical during the first four weeks of flowering. Results from these experiments will be used to improve the current integrated pest management program for tarnished plant bug in cotton and make cotton production more sustainable for Mississippi producers.},

abstract = {Micro-irrigation is introduced primarily to save water and increase the water use efficiency in agriculture. The reduction in water losses in micro-irrigation system over the flood and furrow irrigation method varies from 30–80 per cent and productivity gain by 20–90 per cent in different crops. Keeping in view the present studies were conducted in rain-fed areas under “Farmers Participatory Action Research Programme” (FPARP) during 2008 and 2009 at farmers fields in different locations of Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, India. The purpose was to compare the impact of conventional methods of irrigation (flood/furrow/ring basin) and micro irrigation techniques (sprinkler and drip) on crop yield and economy of farmers. At 6 different locations, five sprinklers and one drip irrigation system were installed. Cauliflower crop was grown at 3 locations while capsicum, tomato and pomegranate were grown at remaining 3 locations. Results of the study revealed that in fields where micro-irrigation systems were installed, the yield of cauliflower I, II, III, capsicum, tomato and pomegranate increased by 93.11, 78.50, 87.23, 17.80, 35.87 and 41.52 per cent, respectively. Likewise, net returns of the farmers from the respective crops increased by 122.34, 92.30, 110.60, 24.54, 22.91 and 38.09 per cent when compared to the conventional methods of irrigation. It can be concluded from the results that the micro-irrigation system not only saves water but also increases yield of the crops and eventually the net returns of the farmers from the same unit of area as compared to conventional methods of irrigation.},

Our study provides an example of such investment, the Participatory Small-Scale Irrigation Development Programme in Ethiopia. Com- bining a primary household survey with geographical data, we estimate the impact of the project on agricultural production and households expenditures using a novel iden- tication strategy. Beneciaries gain from the project through improved crop yields, which raise revenues, and allow switching from relying mainly consuming their own pro- duce to purchasing greater amount of food from the market. Though we rule out that the project may have targeted farmers based on their agricultural performance, sum- mary statistics indicate notable dierences between beneciaries and non-beneciaries, an indication that the project might have systematically targeted farmers with certain attributes. Systematic targeting is often favored either to ensure the highest rate of success, or to deliver the project to those who may need it the most, but may limit the generalizability of the project in relation to any eorts to scaling up.},

abstract = {Background  Adamitulu Jido Komoblcha is one of the districts located in lowland areas of the Oromia region with irrigation potentials of 14,000 hectares out of which only 2568 hectares are under small-scale irrigation practices. Though there are a lot of households using irrigation in the study area, the impact that it has brought on the food security of the household is not yet well studied in the area. Several related studies reviewed lack appropriate impact evaluation methods in studying the impact of small-scale irrigation on food security that may result in overestimation or underestimation of the impact. To this end, the main motivation behind this study was to examine whether small-scale irrigation in the study area is creating positive change on household food security or not using the propensity score matching approach. Methodology Both primary and secondary data were collected and used in the study. The primary data were collected from randomly selected 94 irrigation users and 100 non-user households from February to March 2018. Secondary data were collected from a review of different works of literature. Both descriptive statistics and econometric models were applied to analyze the data using Stata software version 13. The study applied the propensity score matching (PSM) model to analyze the impact of small-scale irrigation on food security. In analyzing the impact of small scale irrigation on food security, we have used calorie intake, crop harvest and consumption both from own production and bought from the sale of the crop harvest produced through irrigation as an indicator of food security. Result The study has found that participation in irrigation is positively determined by age, education, land size, access to extension service, and participation in off or non-farm activities. In contrast to this, participation in irrigation is negatively determined by distance from farm plot to water source and distance from the main market. The results of the nearest neighbor and caliper matching estimators show that participation in small-scale irrigation increased the daily calorie intake of the small-scale irrigation users by 643.76 kcal over non-user households. Similarly, it increased their daily calorie intake to 596.43 kcal and 591.74 kcal, respectively, with radius and kernel matching estimators. The result further indicted that irrigation had positive impact on crop production, consumption and revenue generation which all together indicated improvement in food security. The sensitivity analysis test shows that impact results estimated by this study were insensitive to unobserved selection bias which shows it is a real impact of the irrigation. Conclusion It was concluded that irrigation has a positive and significant impact on household food security. Concerned bodies that working on small-scale irrigation development therefore should continue investment in irrigation activities for poverty reduction strategies and scale-up irrigation interventions to the other areas where there is potentially irrigable land.},

abstract = {Background  Despite extensive irrigation development in Ethiopia, limited studies assessed the impact of irrigation on malaria vector mosquito composition, abundance and seasonality. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of sugarcane irrigation on species composition, abundance and seasonality of malaria vectors. Methods Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps from three irrigated and three non-irrigated clusters in and around Arjo-Didessa sugarcane irrigation scheme in southwestern Ethiopia. Mosquitoes were surveyed in four seasons: two wet and two dry, in 2018 and 2019. Mosquito species composition, abundance and seasonality were compared between irrigated and non-irrigated clusters. Anopheles mosquitoes were sorted out to species using morphological keys and molecular techniques. Chi square was used to test the relationships between Anopheles species occurrence, and environmental and seasonal parameters. Results Overall, 2108 female Anopheles mosquitoes comprising of six species were collected. Of these, 92.7{\%} (n = 1954) were from irrigated clusters and 7.3{\%} (n = 154) from the non-irrigated. The Anopheles gambiae complex was the most abundant (67.3{\%}) followed by Anopheles coustani complex (25.3{\%}) and Anopheles pharoensis (5.7{\%}). PCR-based identification revealed that 74.7{\%} (n = 168) of the An. gambiae complex were Anopheles arabiensis and 22.7{\%} (n = 51) Anopheles amharicus. The density of An. gambiae complex (both indoor and outdoor) was higher in irrigated than non-irrigated clusters. The overall anopheline mosquito abundance during the wet seasons (87.2{\%}; n = 1837) was higher than the dry seasons (12.8{\%}; n = 271). Conclusion The ongoing sugarcane irrigation activities in Arjo-Didessa created conditions suitable for malaria transmitting Anopheles species diversity and abundance. This could drive malaria transmission in Arjo-Didessa and its environs in both dry and wet seasons.

abstract = {Background Despite extensive irrigation development in Ethiopia, limited studies assessed the impact of irrigation on malaria vector mosquito composition, abundance and seasonality. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of sugarcane irrigation on species composition, abundance and seasonality of malaria vectors. Methods Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps from three irrigated and three non-irrigated clusters in and around Arjo-Didessa sugarcane irrigation scheme in southwestern Ethiopia. Mosquitoes were surveyed in four seasons: two wet and two dry, in 2018 and 2019. Mosquito species composition, abundance and seasonality were compared between irrigated and non-irrigated clusters. Anopheles mosquitoes were sorted out to species using morphological keys and molecular techniques. Chi-square was used to test the relationships between Anopheles species occurrence, and environmental and seasonal parameters. Results Overall, 2,108 female Anopheles mosquitoes comprising of six species were collected. Of these, 92.7{\%} (n=1,954) were from irrigated clusters and 7.3{\%} (n=154) from the non-irrigated. The Anopheles gambiae complex was the most abundant (67.3{\%}) followed by Anopheles coustani complex (25.3 {\%}) and Anopheles pharoensis (5.7{\%}). PCR-based identification revealed that 74.7{\%} (n=168) of the An. gambiae comlex were Anopheles arabiensis and 22.7{\%} (n=51) Anopheles amharicus. The density of An. gambiae complex (both indoor and outdoor) was higher in irrigated than non-irrigated clusters. The overall anopheline mosquito abundance during the wet seasons (87.2{\%}; n=1,837) was higher than the dry seasons (12.8{\%}; n=271). Conclusion The ongoing sugarcane irrigation activities in Arjo-Didessa created conditions suitable for malaria transmitting Anopheles species diversity and abundance. This could drive malaria transmission in Arjo-Didessa and its environs in both dry and wet seasons. Currently practiced malaria vector interventions need to be strengthened by including larval source management to reduce vector abundance in the irrigated areas.},

Eighty six water samples collected from canal command area of Tonk district of Rajasthan revealed that 22.1, 10.9, 5.8, 21.5, 29.8 and 9.9{\%} water samples were under good, marginally saline, saline, marginally alkali, alkali and highly alkali categories, respectively. Most of these waters had dominance of sodium followed by calcium in cations and chloride as major anion followed by bicarbonate and carbonates. After interventions of sodic soil reclamation, wheat crop in rabi and pearlmillet in next kharif season was grown. Maximum mean yields of 2.53 t ha⁻¹ grain and 11.0 t ha⁻¹ straw of pearlmillet and 3.95 t ha grain and 4.74 t ha straw of wheat were obtained with deep tillage in summer along with gypsum application @ 50{\%} GR, green manuring and FYM @ 10 t ha⁻¹ followed by GR-50{\%} along with green manuring and FYM @ 10 t ha⁻¹.

abstract = {Irrigation is one means by which agricultural production can be increased to meet the growing food demand in Ethiopia. Small-scale irrigation is becoming the main mechanism in livelihood enhancement discourse especially in recent times when the rainfall pattern is becoming erratic in the country. Small-scale irrigation is a policy priority in Ethiopia for rural poverty alleviation and growth, as well as climate adaptation. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of small-scale irrigation on income of rural household in the North Eastern Ethiopia. The study used Taro proportional sampling techniques formula to get 200 sampling respondents of irrigation and non-irrigation users. Econometric model such as Propensity Score Matching method and binary logistic regression model were used to study the specific objectives, impact of use of small-scale irrigation on households' income and determinants of smallholder farmers' decision to participate in small-scale irrigation water use, respectively. The Propensity Score Matching model using logit estimate indicated that family size, credit access and subsidy with productive safety net program were found positive significant effect. The logit model discovered that sex, livestock holding size, dwelling distance from irrigation farm, and subsidy by productive safety net programme and credit access have determinant effect on decision participation in small-scale irrigation. Therefore, attention should be given by the government in expanding of modern irrigation practice and constructing improved storage house should be given priorities.},

abstract = {Against the backdrop of the water and energy sector reforms enunciated by the state government in Gujarat, this paper reviews the important policy changes and outcomes of farm-level adoption of water-saving technologies, on the one hand, and the effective implementation of energy tariff policies, on the other hand. Following an assessment of the water and energy policy and regulatory interventions, the paper provides an overview of the farm-level adoption micro irrigation (sprinkler and drip irrigation) systems over the past one decade of the policy reforms. The paper then examines the case of energy sector reforms enunciated by the state in coordination with the energy regulator through establishment of the distribution companies (DISCOMs). The paper brings out that the policy and regulatory interventions in the water and energy (power) sectors have been successful in terms of wider promotion of micro irrigation systems and deregulation of power generation and distribution activities by establishing dedicated DISCOMs. Thus, the policy initiatives were able to address several challenges facing the water and energy sectors in the state. Firstly, the wide-scale promotion of micro irrigation schemes has significantly reduced the groundwater over-extraction for agriculture. Second, the energy sector reforms have shown a significant progress towards rationalisation of tariffs across sectors. However, it emerges that the policy and regulatory reforms need to (i) go beyond the narrow confines of promotion of micro irrigation systems towards sustainable management of water resources and (ii) move beyond rationalisation of power tariffs by offering sustainable solutions to the problems of water and energy security amidst increasing competition for inter-sectoral allocations. Essentially, the energy sector policies and reforms may explore the potential of renewable energy sources through decentralised investments in solar and wind energy systems in the rural areas involving different public–private community partnership models.},

abstract = {Integration of advanced irrigation systems and technology is essential to improve crop water productivity and yields, especially in developing countries. This study aims at investigating the effects of adopting a drip irrigation system combined with hand-dug wells on crop water productivity and yields of household farmers and their perception on the proposed scheme over two cropping seasons in the Haramaya District, Ethiopia. We chose three locally called “Kebeles” within the District, and selected a certain number of household farmers that had similar characteristics within each Kebele. The selected farmers had practiced both the proposed drip irrigation with private hand-dug wells water supply (intervention pilots) and traditionally-used surface irrigation with communal water supply (non-intervention pilots) schemes. We also conducted interviews with the selected household farmers, personal observations, and measurements on crop water productivity and yields for both intervention and non-intervention pilots. We found that the proposed drip irrigation system significantly improved the crop productivity and yields of the farmers. More importantly, findings indicated that the use of drip irrigation system combined with hand-dug well water supplies reduced the over-exploitation of water (water savings) and labor-intensive manual-irrigation. The latter particularly helped women to work less on their farm works and thus provided them a flexible system to expand their plot sizes and grow a variety of crops. Overall, the drip irrigation system with water supply from hand-dug wells is highly recommended as it allows a flexible system for household farmers and provides an opportunity to expand their plot sizes with a variety of crops, which is also expected to mitigate the negative implications of climate change on freshwater water resources and crop productivity. However, the farmers of the Haramaya District expressed their need on capacity building, financial and technical supports from local to regional governments and other agencies to ensure an efficient and cost-effective drip irrigation system and to further improve their crop water productivity and yield, food self-sufficieny, and livelihoods. It is also important to consider market-based farming approaches, while promoting efficient irrigation systems and self-supply to ensure quick investment returns. This study recommends to adopt and expand the proposed drip irrigation system at household levels in Sub-Saharan and other similar regions. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {In this article, I examine the Rajapur Irrigation Project (RIP), a large-scale infrastructure project to “modernize” a farmer-managed irrigation system in Nepal, as a political encounter between two ontologies or what Blaser called “ways of worlding”: Tharu farmers' fluid practices of living with the Karnali River and engineers' methods of structurally training waterways. In tracing how the logic and world-making practices of the RIP overwrote the place-based ontologies of local farmers through the concrete structures it enacted and left behind, I introduce ontological marginalization as a political process that can occur when one situated understanding of what the world is and how it should be (re)made is imposed on another through structural interventions. I demonstrate infrastructure's power to enforce certain ontologies while marginalizing others, and I also explore how people reassert agency and world-making practices through acts of ontological reclamation in the aftermath of interventions. Ultimately, this article contributes to emergent discussions on infrastructure and its ontological impacts within geography by developing the dual concepts of ontological marginalization and reclamation as ways for scholars to better account for the political implications of infrastructure on diverse ways of worlding.Alternate abstract:在这篇文章中, 我探讨了拉贾普尔灌溉项目（RIP）。RIP是一个大型基础设施项目, 旨在对尼泊尔农民运营的灌溉系统进行“现代化”。该灌溉系统是两种本体论（或布拉瑟所说的“世界化方法”）之间的政治碰撞：塔鲁农民与卡纳利河共存的流动实践、工程师的结构性航道训练方法。在追溯RIP逻辑和创造世界实践如何通过其制造和遗留的混凝土结构改写农民地方本体论的过程中, 我将本体论边缘化视为一种政治过程。世界是什么、世界应该如何（重新）创造？对这些问题的不同理解发生结构化冲突时, 就出现了这种政治过程。我展示了基础设施在实施某些本体论同时边缘化其它本体论的能力；探讨了人们在发生冲突后, 如何通过本体论改造行为, 重新确立影响力和创造世界的行为。最终, 本文推动了本体论边缘化和改造的双重概念, 旨在帮助学者更好地理解基础设施对不同世界化方法的政治影响, 有助于地理学关于基础设施及其影响本体论的迫切讨论。},

abstract = {Reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture soils is crucial, as it accounts for 5.6–6.8{\%} of global anthropogenic emissions. This study aims to understand the interaction among climate, soil nitrogen (N) and applied N on N2O emissions from the irrigated cotton farming system and its implications on farm economics. We conducted simulations for 116 years (1900–2015) and assessed the effect of different N-fertiliser application rates, initial soil nitrate (NO3) N levels and rainfall conditions on N2O emissions, N2O emission factors (EFs) and financial returns (with and without N2O costs). Results showed the following. 1) The proportional impact of higher N fertiliser rates on soil N2O emissions was greater when initial soil N level was lower (5 mg NO3 kg−1) than higher (35 mg NO3 kg−1). However, the volume of impact was greater under higher initial soil N levels. 2) The relationship between N fertiliser rates and the EFs (range 0.03–7.2{\%}) was not linear but bell-shaped. 3) Fertiliser N requirements increased with rainfall and decreased with initial soil N. Accordingly, the cotton returns for the driest rainfall condition ({\textless}10th percentile) were maximum at 300, 250 and 150 kg N ha−1 for initial soil N of 5, 20 and 35 mg NO3 kg−1. For the wettest rainfall condition ({\textgreater}90th percentile), these rates were 50 kg ha−1 higher across the initial soil N conditions. Any additional application of N-fertiliser above these rates was counterproductive. 4) Inclusion of N2O cost into farm economics reduced the annual returns by up to {\$}39 ha−1, but the optimal fertiliser application rates remain the same. 5) Optimising N fertiliser rates to soil N and rainfall conditions increased the annual returns by up to {\$}303 ha−1, with a further increase of {\$}15 ha−1 from fertiliser use efficiency when the Australian Government incentives under the {\$}2.55 billion dollar Emission Reduction Fund program was considered. These findings suggest that N-fertiliser application rates and N2O emission mitigation strategies need further refinements specific to prevailing soil and climate variabilities.},

abstract = {Crop models have been used for investigating crop responses to environmental stresses for decades. The study objectives were to (i) calibrate and validate a simple crop model (Hybrid-Maize) using in-situ measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments as part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Testing Ag Performance Solutions (TAPS) program in North Platte, NE, and (ii) carry out sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation using a multi-parameter optimization approach. Sixteen Arable Mark 1 sensors and thirty two Mark 2 sensors (Arable Labs Inc., San Francisco, CA) collecting hourly and daily weather and crop information in 2019 and 2020 respectively, were installed in the TAPS subsurface drip irrigation experimental plots which were planted with maize and subjected to different irrigation and nitrogen practices. Hybrid-Maize was used for simulating maize yield on the sixteen treatments in 2019 and 2020. Sensitivity analysis showed that initial light use efficiency (LUE), potential kernel filling rate (G5), potential number of kernels per ear (G2), growth respiration coefficient of grain (GRG), empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake (SLW), and maximum photosynthetic rate (MPR) were the most sensitive parameters to yield. A novel multi-parameter optimization (MPO) approach based on kriging was used for calibrating these six parameters, and the best parameter sets which were later used for model validation. Calibration results showed that there seemed to be strong linear relationships between total water received (WR) and some of the parameters. By using each year's MPO averages of the six parameters instead of default values, ME, MAE, RMSE, uRMSE, and nRMSE were all reduced by about 69{\%}, 66{\%}, 60{\%}, 27{\%}, and 61{\%} respectively for validation treatments. The advantage of using in-situ sensors, coupled with the suitability of the calibrated model for simulating maize yield under different irrigation management, will make the model more useful in future field-scale research with focus on developing decision support tools for in-season crop management and yield forecasts.},

abstract = {Biofertilizers are an important source for completing the plant nutrition program, which has a significant effect on reducing the cost and adverse effects of chemical fertilizers and increasing plant resistance to environmental stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Nitroxine and nitrogen biofertilizer on grain yield, nitrogen utilization and use efficiency, nitrogen remobilization and plant water use efficiency in Nigella sativa (black cumin) grown under different irrigation regimes. The experiment was conducted at Yasouj University Research Field in split plots in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2016 and 2018. Factors studied in this experiment consisted of four irrigation regimes (based on phenological stages) including weekly irrigation from emergence to harvest (WI0) and withholding irrigation from blooming to maturity (WIb), from flowering to maturity (WIf), and from the start of grain formation to maturity (WIs) as a main factor and five levels of fertilizer including no application of fertilizers (N0), 80 kg N ha−1 (N80), 40 kg N ha−1 (N40), combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizer (N40 + B), and Nitroxin biofertilizer (B) as sub factors. Application of 80 kg N ha-1 in complete irrigation, and combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizers in other irrigation regimes were associated with greatest grain yield, N content in aerial organs and water use efficiency. In all irrigation regimes, combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizers resulted in the greatest N remobilization (N already has been stored in the vegetative organs, transferred to the developing grains) rate (12.46 kg ha-1). The greatest N utilization efficiency was obtained in non-fertilizer treatments (15.1 kg kg-1) and withholding irrigation from flowering stage (15.7 kg kg-1). Finally, the results showed that the application of nitroxin biofertilizer can reduce the use of urea chemical fertilizer and mitigate the effects of drought stress by N fixing and possibly producing growth hormones and decrease N utilization and water use efficiency.},

abstract = {A field experiment carried out during 2003 and 2004 in India addressed critical soil moisture tension based alternate wetting and drying (AWD) system of irrigation management in dry season rice cultivation in non-traditional areas under waterlogged and flood-prone deepwater conditions. Results showed that a medium duration rice variety, "Geetanjali", grown with irrigation up to 0.1 bar soil moisture tension produced a comparable grain yield of 4.30-4.50 t ha¹ with that under conventional irrigation management (4.50-4.75 t ha¹). However, a significant yield decline of 17.8-18.1{\%} occurred while applying irrigation at 0.2 bar moisture tension. Mean irrigation water requirement was a maximum of 2295 mm in the conventional system; 28.0, 41.7 and 55.8{\%} higher than those at 0.0, 0.1 and 0.2 bar tension, respectively. Average water use efficiency of 3.57 kg grain ha-mm¹ was also significantly higher at 0.2 bar tension. Irrigation at 0.1 bar moisture tension achieved optimum crop productivity of 4.3-4.4 t ha¹ and water productivity of 0.32-0.34 g grain kg¹ water applied. Thus, it is expected that the results of this study would become very useful while planning future research programmes on water-saving irrigation management, viz. the AWD system in rice cultivation.},

abstract = {Intensification of groundwater irrigation is central to goals of improving food security and reducing chronic poverty faced by millions of rural households across the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP) of Nepal and parts of eastern India. At present, levels of groundwater use and access in the EIGP lag far behind other areas of South Asia despite abundant available groundwater resources. A key reason for prevailing access constraints is the dependence on diesel pumpsets for accessing groundwater, which are typically unsubsidised and therefore expensive to purchase and operate. To date, efforts to reduce access costs have focused almost exclusively on how to incentivise adoption of alternative electric or solar-powered pumping technologies, which are viewed as being cheaper to operate and less environmentally damaging due to their lower operational carbon emissions. In contrast, there has been little attention paid to identifying opportunities to make existing diesel pump systems more cost effective for farmers to operate in order to support adaptation to climate change and reduce poverty. In this study, we use evidence from 116 detailed in-situ pump tests along with interviews with pumpset dealers, mechanics and farmers in the Nepal Terai to assess how and why fuel efficiency and operational costs of diesel pump irrigation are affected by farmers' pumpset selection decisions. We show that costs diesel pumpset irrigation can be reduced significantly by supporting and incentivising farmers (e.g., through equipment advisories, improved supply chains for maintenance services and spare parts) to invest in newer low-cost, portable and smaller horsepower pumpset designs that are more effectively matched to local operating conditions in the EIGP than older Indian manufactured engines that have historically been preferred by farmers in the region. Such interventions can help to unlock potential for intensified irrigation water use in the EIGP, contributing to goals of improving agricultural productivity and resilience to climate extremes while also strengthening farmers capacity to invest in emerging low-carbon pumping technologies.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the evidence available on the provision of financing for African smallholder farmers to purchase irrigation equipment such as pumps, pipes and drip irrigation systems. It sets the scene by first reviewing the literature on experiences with providing microcredit and other microfinance services as a poverty reduction strategy. Based on both case studies and several systematic reviews of the literature, it finds that the outcomes and impacts on poverty, gender equity and broader economic development are mixed at best. Microcredit is not a silver bullet solution to poverty, but it can often help poor households improve their lives. The paper then reviews the demand for and supply of financing for smallholders to purchase irrigation equipment. In surveys, farmers express a strong demand for equipment such as pumps, but often point to the lack of affordable and appropriately designed credit as a critical impediment to gaining access to such equipment. Even where microfinance institutions offer agricultural credit, it is usually short-term seasonal credit to purchase seeds and fertilizer. Credit on these terms is not useful to purchase equipment costing several hundred dollars. Focusing on programs specifically aimed at enabling farmers to purchase irrigation equipment, no credible detailed studies were found documenting the impacts and lessons learned. However, there are currently (as of 2018) numerous promising pilot studies and small projects offering a variety of approaches to enable smallholders to make such purchases. The paper reviews what information is available on these. A major recommendation of this paper is that a research project should be designed to carry out studies of these various experiments to identify what works under what conditions, as a basis for scaling out programs to offer financial services aimed at assisting smallholders to gain access to small-scale irrigation equipment.},

abstract = {The present paper studies the process of irrigation systems modernization in five selected cases located in the Mediterranean and West African regions. These were chosen from fourteen irrigation schemes, ranging from 400 to 40000 hectares, surveyed by the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage (IPTRID) in 2002. It describes the technical, managerial and financial aspects of the processes that took place, which were accompanied by institutional reforms in some cases. It identifies the factors that led to the decision to modernize the systems and the impacts of the interventions on water use efficiency, water service quality and guarantee, equity of water sharing and the sustainability of the irrigation scheme. Finally, the paper summarizes lessons learnt, which could make modernization processes more effective.},

abstract = {The Gujarat state government had banned further extraction of groundwater and new electricity connection for agricultural purposes in 57 sub-districts, where over-exploitation of groundwater was observed, in 2001, and these regions were demarcated as dark zone in 2003. The micro-irrigation adopted farmers in these regions are entitled to get additional 10 per cent subsidy since 2012, and concurrently, the ban on new electricity connection was also withdrawn. In particular, adoption of micro-irrigation is mandatory for availing new power connection. Both of them could lead to a large-scale diffusion, and as a result, reducing pressure on groundwater extraction. Although various agricultural interventions are being incentivized in India, there is limited studies with respect to assessing its' impact on farmers' adoption behaviour. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate effect of the above said incentives (subsidy and power connection) on diffusion of micro-irrigation in the dark zone regions. Information on the diffusion of micro-irrigation, i.e., drip and sprinkler irrigation, between 2006-07 and 2014 were collected for 8073 villages and towns, combining both dark zone (treated sample) and its adjacent non dark zone talukas (control group). The empirical analysis was performed for three different samples: (i) full sample, (ii) villages along the administrative boundary line drawn between the dark zone and adjacent talukas, i.e., border villages, and (iii) pair-wise border villages; expected to get robust estimation in the latter two cases as there could be no significant difference with respect to hydrological scenario and cropping patterns. Employing ordinary Least Square fixed effects model, results reveal that these policies are positively influencing diffusion of micro-irrigation. A pecuniary benefits and power connection together, for example, enhance the likelihood of incremental adoption rate by 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent and area installed with micro-irrigation technologies between 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent. This study, henceforth, supports the continuation of present incentive policies to further heightening diffusion of such technologies, and this approach could be replicated in the case other resource efficient technologies as minimizing water and energy footprints are always a policy priority.},

abstract = {Irrigation projects have elicited ambiguous views, if not outright animosity, during the past four decades. Aside from environmental and relocation concerns, low productivity is a source of criticism. Irrigation management systems in developing countries seem to have historically underperformed due to government control. Weak institutional arrangements have hindered effective and timely water distribution. There is widespread dissatisfaction with technocratic top-down programmes imposed with little community support. A rising recognition that more advanced engineering and information technologies are not the primary drivers of increased irrigation potential utilisation has resulted in an emphasis on farmer-led irrigation. Many developing countries have introduced reform instruments since the 1980s, with the most notable paradigm being a move from government control to participative management by stakeholders. This study looks into the situation in Cambodia where participation of farmers in managing irrigation schemes is being sought through the formation of Farmers Water Users Committees. The study quantifies the improvement in project performance with farmers' participation through Farmers Water Users Committees and finds it significant. Furthermore, using difference-in-difference methodology, this research finds that the improvement is not a blip and is sustained over the medium term.},

Projected climate for two future time slices the 2060s (2020 to 2059) and the 2100s (2060 to 2100) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) were used for climate change impact assessment.

Annual inflow in the central (southern) region reservoirs exhibited downward (upward) trends during the 2060s and only upward trends during the 2100s, respectively, whereas rice ETc showed upward tendencies regardless of the farming practices.

Ninety-two samples were infected with Enterococcus faecalis for 21 days and biofilm formation was verified using scanning electron microscopy (n = 2). The 90 infected samples were randomly assigned into 9 groups: no intervention (initial), 1.5{\%} NaOCl irrigation (1.5 N), 2.5{\%} NaOCl irrigation (2.5 N), 1.5 N + intermittent passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), 1.5 N + intermittent canal brushing with Navitip FX (NFX), 1.5 N + intermittent XP-endo Finisher (XPF), 1.5 N + circumferential filing (CF), 1.5 N + 1-min Self-adjusting File (SAF), and 1.5 N + mechanical instrumentation using {\#}90‒110 files (MI). Subsequently, the root canal walls were shaved for microbial analysis. The mean colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined and analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance.RESULTSThe mean CFU count was lowest in the MI group (63.5 CFU/mL), followed by the NFX, XPF, SAF, 2.5 N, CF, PUI, 1.5 N, and initial groups. The remaining bacteria in the 1.5 N group was 3.6-fold higher than that of the PUI group; 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the 2.5 N, CF, and SAF groups; and 22-fold and 36-fold higher than that of the XPF and NFX groups, respectively. The 2.5 N and 1.5 N groups with adjunctive treatments, excluding the PUI group, had significantly fewer remaining bacteria compared with the 1.5 N group (P {\textless} .05).CONCLUSIONSPerforming various procedures supplemental to 1.5 N improved large root canal disinfection. Adjunctive NFX most effectively reduced the number of bacteria without dentin removal.},

abstract = {Red chicory (radicchio) plants produce leafy heads that are of great commercial interest and they require a proper irrigation technique to achieve satisfactory productivity. The use of mini-sprinklers with high-frequency irrigation schedules may increase radicchio productivity, provide better growing conditions due to timely intervention, and save water, but so far little research has been carried out on this topic. This experiment aims at evaluating the effect of two mini-sprinkler irrigation schedules (high- and low-frequency) on radicchio yield and growing conditions over a 5-year cultivation period. Marketable radicchio head production was on average 12{\%} greater with the high-frequency schedule (26.5 t ha−1) than with the low-frequency schedule (23.6 t ha−1), mainly due to greater head weight. The number of underweight, pre-flowering, rotten, and missing plants was significantly different between the two schedules when these variables were considered separately, but the overall number of marketable plants was greater in the high-frequency schedule during certain years. In general, the high-frequency schedule permitted to increase both radicchio yield and to reduce irrigation water use on average by 14{\%} (−24 mm in volume), improving the irrigation water productivity by 19{\%} (from 0.18 t mm−1 of the low-frequency schedule to 0.22 t mm−1 of the high-frequency schedule). Reducing the irrigation interval permits a timely adaptation to the weather course and improves radicchio growing conditions, presenting itself as a valid strategy that could be adopted by the farmers, upon appropriate consideration of energy and management costs.},

abstract = {The projected climate scenario for South Mediterranean Europe predicts lower precipitation and higher temperatures that will negatively affect viticulture in the region. The application of moderate deficit irrigation at crucial moments of berry ripening has been found to improve berry quality. Furthermore, grapevine association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may improve grapevine's ability to cope with abiotic stresses. Therefore, the aims of this research were: (1) to characterize the response of three clones of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo to the combination of different water deficit programs and AMF inoculation under elevated temperatures, and (2) to determine whether AMF inoculation can improve berry antioxidant properties under these conditions. The study was carried out on three fruit-bearing cuttings clones of cv. Tempranillo (CL-260, CL-1089 and CL-843) inoculated (+M) or not (−M) with AMF and subjected to two temperature regimes (24/14°C and 28/18°C (day/night)) combined with three irrigation regimes during berry ripening. Irrigation treatments were: (i) water deficit from fruit set to veraison (early deficit, ED); (ii) water deficit from veraison to maturity (late deficit, LD); and (iii) full irrigation (FI). Although each Tempranillo clone seemed to have different abilities to respond to elevated temperatures and water supply, in general, at 24/14°C the LD treatment performed better than ED. Differences among clones were attenuated at 28/18°C. In addition, potential benefits of the LD treatment were improved by AMF inoculation. Thus, in all clones the loss of anthocyanins at 28/18°C detected in −M plants after applying LD did not occur in the +M plants. Moreover, AMF inoculation increased must antioxidant capacity in CL-843 under these environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the implementation of measures to promote the association of grapevines with appropriate AMF for each variety could contribute to optimize effects of irrigation strategy on berry properties under future warming conditions.},

abstract = {Immediate posttreatment irrigation has been proposed as a method to reduce hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt Davy] phytotoxicity from topramezone. Immediate irrigation is impractical, because it would take a turfgrass sprayer 10 to 15 min to cover an average golf course fairway or athletic field. There is also insufficient evidence regarding how posttreatment irrigation, immediate or otherwise, influences mature goosegrass [Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn.] control from topramezone or low-dose topramezone plus metribuzin programs. We sought to investigate bermudagrass and E. indica response to immediate, 15-min, and 30-min posttreatment irrigation compared with no irrigation following topramezone at 12.3 g ae ha−1, the lowest labeled rate, or topramezone at 6.1 g ha−1 plus metribuzin at 210 g ai ha−1. We also evaluated placement of each herbicide and their combination on soil, foliage, and soil plus foliage to help elucidate the mechanisms involved in differential responses between species and herbicide mixtures. Responses were largely dependent on trial due to bermudagrass injury from high-dose topramezone being nearly eliminated by immediate irrigation in one trial and only slightly affected in another. When posttreatment irrigation was postponed for 15 or 30 min, topramezone alone injured bermudagrass unacceptably in both trials. Bermudagrass was injured less by low-dose topramezone plus metribuzin than by high-dose topramezone. All posttreatment irrigation timings reduced E. indica control compared with no posttreatment irrigation. The herbicide placement study suggested that topramezone control of E. indica is highly dependent on foliar uptake and that phytotoxicity of both bermudagrass and E. indica is greater from topramezone than metribuzin. Thus, posttreatment irrigation likely reduces topramezone rate load with a concomitant effect on plant phytotoxicity of both species. Metribuzin reduced 21-d cumulative clipping weight and tiller production of plants, and this may be a mechanism by which it reduces foliar white discoloration from topramezone.},

@phdthesis{Yohannes2020,
abstract = {To address the problem of water scarcity and to achieve food self-sufficiency, huge efforts and massive irrigation developments have been made in the last twenty-five years by the Ethiopian Government. However, the performance of many small-scale irrigation (SSI) schemes is still very poor. Deficient irrigation water management is one of the major factors challenging the success and the sustainability of the SSI. Farmers are constrained by inappropriate irrigation management strategies, which result in irrigation water scarcity, yield loss and undesirable environmental impacts in most SSI. The issue of sustainability is given hardly attention.This thesis tries to assess, understand and evaluate the current irrigation water management practices in relation to crop yield and soil salinization and then come-up with simple and innovative irrigation water management strategies that can influence the farmers' decision and enable them to cope with the problem of water scarcity and soil salinity.In Chapter 2 farmers' irrigation water management practices, challenges, perceptions and adaptation were studied. We evaluated farmers survey data, field observations and measurements and found that the farmers' perception of the major causes for aggravating water scarcity, crop yield decline and soil salinization were in line with field observations. The overall plot level and scheme level adaptation strategies of the farmers were not good enough. The farmers are constrained by lack of technical knowledge, weak enforcement capability of the Water Users Association (WUA) and poor irrigation infrastructures to manage the irrigation water properly at plot as well as at scheme level.The government involvement on sustainability of irrigation schemes is poor. Also, the top-down approach by local government authorities has been constraining the farmers' adaptation strategies. The study showed that allowing beneficiaries to make their own decision resulted in innovative drought adaptation strategies. For sustainable utilization of the irrigation scheme, priority should be given to interventions focused on improvement of water efficiency at farm as well as at scheme level.In Chapter 3 we developed a simple irrigation scheduling method based on an FAO procedure (Brouwer et al., 1989), the Hargreaves ET0 equation and the opinions of local farmers and extension agents. Then, under participation and close observation of farmers the method was compared to CropWat simulated and local (Traditional) scheduling practices, using maize as indicator crop.We found that the simple irrigation schedule method resulted in higher grain yield, substantial irrigation water saving and subsequently in significant improvement of water productivity as compared to the other approaches. Farmers' and experts' opinions were in favour of the Practical scheduling method. The practical irrigation scheduling method is thus recommended for maize in the Gumselassa area. The presented procedure can be adopted for preparation of irrigation calendars of other crops, and in other regions.In Chapter 4 we presented a sustainable utilization of the scarce irrigation water resources using cyclic (conjunctive) irrigation strategies for the production of onion. The effects of irrigation strategies using fresh water, moderately-saline water and cyclic combinations of both waters on onion yield and soil salinization were evaluated based on two years experimental data. The study was conducted under close observation and involvement of farmers and extension agents. The results indicated that the cyclic irrigation strategies are promising options for the production of onion without undue onion yield reduction and soil salinization as compared to irrigation using fresh water.In Chapter 5 the long-term (ten years) impact of cyclic irrigation strategies on relative onion yield and soil health were evaluated. Climatic data, and data collected from the irrigation scheme and the field experiment (Chapter 4) were used to calibrate and validate the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. Two scenarios, i.e. 60 mm pre-plant irrigation (PPI) for the 1st case and 70 mm PPI plus 20 percent leaching fraction (LF) for the 2nd case, were used for long-term simulations.Results of the simulation revealed that salinity build-up is critically affected by irrigation water qualities and the application frequencies and the amount of annual rainfall. Irrigating using seepage water resulted in lower onion yield and higher salt accumulation in the root-zone, for both scenarios. Considering soil salinization, results of the long-term simulation indicated that, the cyclic irrigation strategies can be used safely through increasing the PPT to 70 mm and introducing 20{\%} LF.},

abstract = {Access to reliable irrigation enables farmers to adopt new technologies and intensify agricultural, water and land productivity. The Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) of 2000 in Zimbabwe ushered in new, unskilled cadres in the irrigation sector, drastically reducing the area under irrigation from approximately 200,000 ha developed for irrigation to around 120,000 ha. This trend could be explained by lack of knowledge of institutional factors influencing farmers' decisions to participate in irrigation development. A study was done in Mashonaland East Province to investigate the institutional determinants influencing farmer participation in irrigation development. The empirical results revealed the importance of training, cost recovery, participation in design and implementation, access to extension, and access to credit extension in influencing farmers to participate in irrigation development. The findings suggest that it is important to identify institutional mechanisms of assisting the FTLRP beneficiaries to participate in irrigation development. Thus, policy-makers should put emphasis on increasing farmers' knowledge and perception of the merits of irrigation development through better access to technical information and extension as this assists them to develop a positive economic assessment of irrigation development.},

abstract = {In many social-ecological systems, shared resources play a critical role in supporting the livelihoods of rural populations. Physical infrastructure  enables resource access and reduces the variability of resource supply. In order for the infrastructure to remain functional, institutions must incentivize individuals to engage in provision and maintenance. The objective of my dissertation is to understand key formal and informal institutions that affect provision of shared infrastructure and the policy tools that may improve infrastructure provision. I examine these questions in the context of irrigation systems in India because infrastructure maintenance is a persistent challenge and system function is critical for global food production. My first study investigates how the presence of private infrastructure, such as groundwater pumps, affects the provision of shared infrastructure, such as shared tanks or surface reservoirs. I examine whether formal institutions, such as water pricing instruments, may prevent under-provision of the shared tanks. My findings suggest that in the absence of rules that coordinate tank maintenance, the presence of private pumps will have a detrimental effect on system productivity and equality. On the other hand, the combination of a fixed groundwater fee and a location-based maintenance fee for tank users can improve system productivity and equality. The second study examines the effect of power asymmetries between farmers, caused by informal institutions such as caste, on the persistence of political institutions that govern infrastructure provision. I examined the effect of policy tools, such as non-farm wage employment and informational interventions, on the persistence of two types of political institutions: self-governed and nested. Results suggest that critical regime shifts in political institutions can be generated by either intervening in formal institutions, such as non-farm wage employment, or informal institutions, such as knowledge transmission or learning mechanisms. The third study investigates how bureaucratic and political corruption affect public good provision. I examine how institutional and environmental factors affect the likelihood of corruption and infrastructure provision. I demonstrate that cracking down on corruption is only beneficial when infrastructure provision is poor. I also show that bureaucratic wages play an important role in curbing extralegal transactions and improving infrastructure provision.},

abstract = {In response to a congressional mandate, the US Global Change Research Program organized a National Assessment of Climate Change focusing on geographic regions (e.g. Alaska, Great Plains) and sectors (e.g. public health, agriculture, water resources). This paper describes methodology and results of a study by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory contributing to the water sector analysis. The subsequent paper makes use of the water supply results to estimate the climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture. The vulnerability of water resources in the conterminous US to climate changes in 10-year periods centered on 2030 and 2095 as projected by the Hadley/United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) general circulation model (GCM; HadCM2) were modeled using the Hydrologic Unit Model for the United States (HUMUS). HUMUS, a biophysically based hydrology model, consists of a Geographical Information System (GIS) that provides data on soils, land use and climate to drive the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The modeling was done at the scale of the eight-digit United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydrologic Unit Area (HUA) of which there are 2101 in the conterminous US. Results are aggregated to the four- and two-digit (major water resource region, MWRR) scales for various purposes. Daily records of maximum/minimum temperature and precipitation (PPT) from 1961 to 1990 provided the baseline climate. Water yields (WY), used as a measure of water supply for irrigation, increases from the 1961–1990 baseline period over most of the US in 2030 and 2095. In 2030, WY increases in the western US and decreases in the central and southeast regions. Notably, WY increases by 139mm (35{\%}) from baseline in the Pacific Northwest. Driven by higher temperatures and reduced precipitation, WY is projected to decrease in the Lower Mississippi and Texas Gulf basins. The HadCM2 (2095) scenario projects a climate significantly wetter than baseline, resulting in water yield increases of 38{\%} on average. Water yield increases are projected to be significant throughout the eastern US—39{\%} in the Ohio basin, for example. Water yields increase significantly in the western US, as well—57 and 76{\%} in the Upper and Lower Colorado, respectively. Climate change also affects the seasonality of the hydrologic cycle. Early snowmelt is induced in western basins, leading to dramatically increased water yields in late winter and early spring. The simulations were run at current (365ppm) and elevated (560ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations [CO2] to account for the potential impacts of the ‘CO2-fertilization' effect. The effects of climate change scenario were considerably greater than those due to elevated [CO2] but the latter, overall, decreased losses and augmented increases in water yield.},

abstract = {Sustaining irrigated agriculture to meet food production needs while maintaining aquatic ecosystems is at the heart of many policy debates in various parts of the world, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Researchers and practitioners are increasingly calling for integrated approaches, and policy-makers are progressively supporting the inclusion of ecological and social aspects in water management programs. This paper contributes to this policy debate by providing an integrated economic-hydrologic modeling framework that captures the socio-economic and environmental effects of various policy initiatives and climate variability. This modeling integration includes a risk-based economic optimization model and a hydrologic water management simulation model that have been specified for the Middle Guadiana basin, a vulnerable drought-prone agro-ecological area with highly regulated river systems in southwest Spain. Namely, two key water policy interventions were investigated: the implementation of minimum environmental flows (supported by the European Water Framework Directive, EU WFD), and a reduction in the legal amount of water delivered for irrigation (planned measure included in the new Guadiana River Basin Management Plan, GRBMP, still under discussion). Results indicate that current patterns of excessive water use for irrigation in the basin may put environmental flow demands at risk, jeopardizing the WFD's goal of restoring the 'good ecological status' of water bodies by 2015. Conflicts between environmental and agricultural water uses will be stressed during prolonged dry episodes, and particularly in summer low-flow periods, when there is an important increase of crop irrigation water requirements. Securing minimum stream flows would entail a substantial reduction in irrigation water use for rice cultivation, which might affect the profitability and economic viability of small rice-growing farms located upstream in the river. The new GRBMP could contribute to balance competing water demands in the basin and to increase economic water productivity, but might not be sufficient to ensure the provision of environmental flows as required by the WFD. A thoroughly revision of the basin's water use concession system for irrigation seems to be needed in order to bring the GRBMP in line with the WFD objectives. Furthermore, the study illustrates that social, economic, institutional, and technological factors, in addition to bio-physical conditions, are important issues to be considered for designing and developing water management strategies. The research initiative presented in this paper demonstrates that hydro-economic models can explicitly integrate all these issues, constituting a valuable tool that could assist policy makers for implementing sustainable irrigation policies.},

abstract = {Individual effect of different field scale management interventions for water saving in rice viz. changing date of transplanting, cultivar and irrigation schedule on yield, water saving and water productivity is well documented in the literature. However, little is known about their integrated effect. To study that, field experimentation and modeling approach was used. Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2006 and 2007) at Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana on a deep alluvial loamy sand Typic Ustipsamment soils developed under hyper-thermic regime. Treatments included three dates of transplanting (25 May, 10 June and 25 June), two cultivars (PR 118 inbred and RH 257 hybrid) and two irrigation schedules (2-days drainage period and at soil water suction of 16kPa). The model used was CropSyst, which has already been calibrated for growth (periodic biomass and LAI) of rice and soil water content in two independent experiments. The main findings of the field and simulation studies conducted are compared to any individual, integrated management of transplanting date, cultivar and irrigation, sustained yield (6.3–7.5tha−1) and saved substantial amount of water in rice. For example, with two management interventions, i.e. shifting of transplanting date to lower evaporative demand (from 5 May to 25 June) concomitant with growing of short duration hybrid variety (90 days from transplanting to harvest), the total real water saving (wet saving) through reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) was 140mm, which was almost double than managing the single, i.e. 66mm by shifting transplanting or 71mm by growing short duration hybrid variety. Shifting the transplanting date saved water through reduction in soil water evaporation component while growing of short duration variety through reduction in both evaporation and transpiration components of water balance. Managing irrigation water schedule based on soil water suction of 16kPa at 15–20cm soil depth, compared to 2-day drainage, did not save water in real (wet saving), however, it resulted into apparent water saving (dry saving). The real crop water productivity (marketable yield/ET) was more by 17{\%} in 25th June transplanted rice than 25th May, 23{\%} in short duration variety than long and 2{\%} in irrigation treatment of 16kPa soil water suction than 2-days drainage. The corresponding values for the apparent crop water productivity (marketable yield/irrigation water applied) were 16, 20 and 50{\%}, respectively. Pooled experimental data of 2 years showed that with managing irrigation scheduling based on soil water suction of 16kPa at 15–20cm soil depth, though 700mm irrigation water was saved but the associated yield was reduced by 277kgha−1.},

abstract = {This dissertation explores some components of the soil water balance in turfgrass systems that remain poorly understood. Specifically, rainfall interception of the turfgrass canopy and the canopy response to soil moisture deficits. Two research studies were conducted at Kansas State University at the Rocky Ford Turfgrass Research Center, Manhattan, KS. The first research study (Chapter 1) investigated the magnitude of canopy interception and the role that meteorological conditions and plant canopy characteristics play in turfgrass systems. Canopy interception has largely been ignored in turfgrass irrigation scheduling programs and the magnitude of interception effects remains unknown. Canopy interception of two common turfgrass species, zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica L.) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), was measured during various precipitation events in the fall of 2019 and spring of 2020. Canopy throughfall amount resulted in a strong (r = 0.98) positive linear relationship with precipitation total. On average, zoysiagrass and creeping bentgrass canopies intercepted a minimum amount of 5 mm before throughfall occurs. This indicates that no precipitation reaches the soil surface for precipitation events {\textless} 5 mm. Nearly 60{\%} of the contiguous United States could result in annual precipitation interception of 50{\%} within a turfgrass canopy. This study provides detailed insights to understanding the interception dynamics in turfgrass and highlights the inefficient nature of small precipitation and irrigation events in turfgrass systems.The second research study (Chapter 2) was conducted throughout the 2019 and 2020 growing season which focused on integrating soil moisture, canopy information, and forecasted precipitation to guide our water management decisions in ‘Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica L.). We discovered that incorporating soil moisture, plant canopy conditions, and forecasted precipitation into a decision tree resulted in water savings of 81{\%} in 2020 and 66{\%} in 2019 compared to a traditional fixed-amount irrigation scheduling. The decision tree is simple decision-support tool that enhanced our ability to identify and apply irrigation at the most opportune time without sacrificing turfgrass quality.},

abstract = {As climate change adaptation is becoming a recognized policy issue, the need is growing for quantitative economic evaluation of adaptation-related public investment, particularly in the context of climate finance. Funds are meant to be allocated not to any types of beneficial investments with or without climate change but to projects regarded as effective for climate change adaptation based on some metrics. But attempts at such project-specific evaluation of adaptation effects are few, in part because such assessments require an integration of various types of simulation analyses. Against this background, we conduct a case study of a Kenyan irrigation development project using a combination of downscaled climate data, runoff simulations, yield forecasting, and local socioeconomic projections to examine the effects of interventions specifically attributable to climate change adaptation, i.e., how much irrigation development can reduce the negative effects of climate change in the future. The results show that despite the uncertainties in precipitation trends, increased temperatures due to climate change have a general tendency to reduce rice yields, and that irrigation development will mitigate income impacts from the yield loss–for example, for the median scenario, the household income loss of 6{\%} in 2050 due to climate change without irrigation development is flipped to become positive with the project. This means that the irrigation development project will likely be effective as a means for climate change adaptation.},

abstract = {Due to severe water scarcity, water resources used in agricultural sector have been reduced markedly in Hetao irrigation district. Application of water-saving practices (WSPs) is required for the sustainable agricultural development. The human activities including WSPs and increase of groundwater abstraction can lower down the groundwater table, which is helpful to the salinity control. Meanwhile, an excessively large groundwater table depth may result in negative impact on crop growth and fragile ecological environment. In this paper, the Jiefangzha irrigation system in Hetao irrigation district was selected as a typical area, a groundwater flow model based on Arclnfo Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed and implemented to quantify the effect of human activities on the groundwater system in this area. The pre- and post-processing of model data was performed efficiently by using the available GIS tools. The time-variant data in boundary conditions was further edited in Microsoft Excel with programs of Visual Basic for Application (VBA). The model was calibrated and validated with independent data sets. Application of the model indicated that it can well describe the effect of human activities on groundwater dynamics in Jiefangzha irrigation system.},

abstract = {Irrigation in arid regions requires special attention to optimize the management of all components of the orchard system in order to increase water use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts (e.g. soil salinization, degradation of ground and surface waters). This six-year study reports the comparison of some orchard practices (soil and irrigation management, plant nutrition) routinely adopted by local farmers (conventional, C) with those interventions having the potential to save water and maximize water use efficiency in a peach orchard and therefore defined as sustainable (S). Due to the relative approach (C versus S) used in this study, classical statistical comparison of results could not be made. The S system included the application of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with specific crop coefficients to calculate the plant water requirement. The S system on average saved 1450 m3 ha-1 of water per year without affecting yield or fruit quality. The concept of economic water productivity (E(WP)) is discussed. We conclude that addressing some practices currently adopted by farmers could increase sustainability of irrigation and enhance (E(WP)) in peach tree orchards.},

abstract = {In irrigated areas, the intelligent management and scientific decision-making of agricultural irrigation are premised on the accurate estimation of the ecological water demand for different crops under different spatiotemporal conditions. However, the existing estimation methods are blind, slow, or inaccurate, compared with the index values of the water demand collected in real time from irrigated areas. To solve the problem, this paper innovatively introduces the spatiotemporal features of ecological water demand to the forecast of future water demand by integrating an artificial neural network (ANN) for water demand prediction with the prediction indices of water demand. Firstly, the ecological water demand for agricultural irrigation of crops was calculated, and a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was constructed for predicting the water demand of agricultural irrigation. On this basis, an intelligent control strategy was presented for agricultural irrigation based on water demand prediction. The structure of the intelligent control system was fully clarified, and the main program was designed in detail. The proposed model was proved effective through experiments.

abstract = {Intelligent irrigation technologies have been developed in recent years to apply irrigation to turf and landscape plants. These technologies are an evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation controller, which calculates ET for local microclimate. Then, the controller creates a program for loading and communicating automatically with drip or sprinkler system controllers. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the new ET sensors in ability to irrigate agricultural crops and to conserve water use for crop in arid climatic conditions. This paper presents the case for water conservation using intelligent irrigation system (IIS) application technology. The IIS for automating irrigation scheduling was implemented and tested with sprinkle and drip irrigation systems to irrigate wheat and tomato crops. Another irrigation scheduling system was also installed and operated as another treatment, which is based on weather data that retrieved from an automatic weather station. This irrigation control system was running in parallel to the former system (IIS) to be control experiments for comparison purposes. However, this article discusses the implementation of IIS, its installation, testing and calibration of various components. The experiments conducted for one growing season 2009-2010 and the results were represented and discussed herein. Data from all plots were analyzed, which were including soil water status, water consumption, and crop yield. The initial results indicate that up to 25{\%} water saving by intelligent irrigation compared to control method, while maintaining competing yield. Results show that the crop evapotranspiration values for control experiments were higher than that of ET-System in consistent trend during whole growth season. The analysis points out that the values of the two treatments were somewhat close to each other's only in the initial development stages. Generally, the ET-System, with some modification was precise in controlling irrigation water and has been proven to be a good mean to determine the water requirements for crops and to schedule irrigation automatically.},

Average absolute differences between measured and simulated irrigation and deep percolation by event were different among irrigation technologies, ranging from 0 to 0.46 and 0.19 to 2.03 cm, respectively. The model is available as an online tool through the Florida Automated Weather Network using Google technology. The free tool requires minimum user input, offers default values, and generates an updated e-mail by using the input data and real-time weather on a weekly basis.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the effect of the Internet on irrigation system adoption. The authors implement the most extensive household survey of irrigation arrangements ever conducted in rural China and also exploit a public program to improve the quality of distance education in rural middle schools, which has led to plausibly exogenous variation in Internet access across rural districts. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a conceptual framework highlighting the transmission mechanisms whereby Internet access may affect irrigation system selection and identify direct effects through agricultural production and an indirect effect through non-agricultural production. To examine the effect of the Internet on irrigation system adoption, we implement the most extensive household survey of irrigation arrangements ever conducted in rural China. We also exploit a public program to improve the quality of distance education in rural middle schools, which has led to plausibly exogenous variation in Internet access across rural districts. Findings: The authors find evidence to suggest that Internet access can effectively reduce information frictions and searching costs in the non-agricultural labor market, thus increasing rural households' participation in non-farm work. To save more hours from agricultural production, rural households select more labor-saving irrigation systems. Originality/value: This study's findings have important implications for the ongoing policy debate over government investment in Internet infrastructure to improve agricultural development in rural and isolated areas. {\textcopyright} 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {With the support from various donors, His Majesty's Government of Nepal has implemented support programmes with a view to transform water availability, improve production, and increase the institutional capabilities of farmers to develop and sustain efficient, fair and reliable irrigation management practices in irrigation systems in Nepal. In this respect, this study aimed to understand the social, administrative and political processes involved in the social and institutional changes brought about by development interventions at local level. This study focused mainly on the physical aspects of the interventions, the way they were implemented and the consequences for local institutions.The study consists of seven chapters. The first chapter consists of the nature of the problem, research focus and research objective. The various concepts and the theoretical framework along with the various methods used in generating information are presented in the second chapter. The socio-political and administrative environment of the country along with government policies and the priority in irrigation and agriculture development in different plan periods are discussed in the third chapter. The four case studies are discussed in chapters four to six. The case studies consist of the description of the general environment along with the presentation of the cases. The presentation is followed by an analysis of the case. The final chapter includes major findings of the case studies and conclusions. The changes in the government policy at various times have resulted in differences in the intervention strategies designed for various programmes. Moreover, there was no consistency in the intervention policies for various programmes at the same time. The government policy of seeking users' participation in the decision making of project design and implementation was mixed during the 1980s, as indicated by the interventions under different programmes. For example, small-scale financial support for the improvement of the FMIS was implemented with a more or less 'participatory approach'. The processes followed in new construction projects were not based on a 'participatory approach'. However, users' participation in the decision making since the early 1990s was a precondition for the initiation of intervention processes.The study shows that the initiation of interventions is complicated and not always very transparent due to the different objectives and hidden agendas of all the actors involved such as: the users, local leaders, local and regional institutions, government agencies, and external donors. The initiative for interventions started at the local level. The users, local leaders and VP officials formed a linking loop to obtain the resources from in which, they were successful. The VP acted as intermediary between the users and the government agencies in the initiation process of the intervention. However, the linking loop did not function well during the design of the project, as the government officials designed the interventions and great emphasis was placed on the financial and technical aspects, which were not discussed at length with the users. As a result the knowledge of the users' was not fully utilised by the agency officials. The cases indicate that the interface between the users and the other actors were not so intensive to reflect a 'participatory approach'.The implementation of the intervention could be categorised into three types. They are the new construction, rehabilitation and improvement. The objective of the intervention determined the type and scale of financial, technical and the institutional involvement in its implementation. The cases indicate that most of the UCs formed for the purpose of the intervention acted as 'construction committees' and failed to function after the completion of the intervention. In this respect the objectives of creating institutions for the implementation were partially achieved, but they could not ensure the complete participation of the users. Thus, the linking loop formed to obtain the government resources disintegrated during the implementation of the project. However, users with the help of the VP/VDC were quick to form a linking loop to obtain resources for other interventions.The analysis of the cases reveals that four institutions a) the Ditthawal system, b) DIO, c) VP/VDC and d) UC were important for the governance and the management of irrigation systems. The cases also indicate that the legitimacy of the institutions was established through the confidence of the users. The formal or informal status of the institution is secondary. The cases indicate that the fundamental reform of collective-choice rule due to the changes effected by the irrigation intervention in the governance structure contributed to increasing anarchy in 'rules in use'. Besides, there was little contribution in the design by the users due to an absence of constitutional-choice rule. The study also shows that many aspects of 'conditions for successful schemes' were violated due to changes in village administration. The study also shows that agency taking over constitutional-choice rule (policy) without adequate understanding of the village needs.The construction of permanent headworks and the canal lining has facilitated the operations of the system and the task of the users has been made easier. As a result, less participation of the users was needed for the system development, regular repair and cleaning of the canal. The users however lost the social control of the irrigation system due to the introduction of new technology and their dependence on outside resources was increasing. The user allocation of water in the case study area is based on irrigable land. Three types of water distribution practices are prevailing in the case study area. They are rotation, field to field and unregulated allocation. The cases indicate that the contributions in the operation and maintenance of the irrigation system are not the sufficient condition for a fair access to irrigation water. The degree of social control on which the institutions would rely was an important factor for ensuring fair distribution of water resources among the members.Three types of conflicts have been identified from the analysis of the cases. They are the conflict between the irrigation systems over the use of a single water source. However, the construction of the permanent weir did facilitate in defining the water rights between the irrigation systems. The second type of dispute is among the users due to weak institutional arrangements for the distribution of water. The third type of conflict is between the agency and the users due to lack of intensive interfaces during the planning and implementation of the intervention, which had implications on turning over the management of the irrigation system.The nature and extent of the participation by the users reflects that the interventions were not successful in seeking the active participation of the people in decision making due to a lack of an intensive interface between the actors involved in the design and implementation of the interventions. The analysis of the cases suggests that the most common form of participation for resource mobilisation was labour, land and time. The pattern of resource mobilisation shows that the newly introduced irrigation technologies such as permanent structures of the irrigation systems make the user more dependent on the external resources. The cash contribution was almost negligible. The complexity of the technology has considerable consequences for the need for external resources and expertise. The increasing dependence on external agencies for the sustenance of the irrigation system reflects that new linking loops are emerging through interfaces between the actors involved in irrigation development. This indicates that the technical intervention is demanding new organisational control.In all the four case studies, the maintenance of the system after the interventions depended largely on external resources when it came to cash contributions. The newly introduced UCs were only functioning during the time of the intervention but were not functional in mobilising resources for the maintenance of irrigation system. This means a greater dependence on government support. When this is not forthcoming the sustainability of the FMIS is questionable. It is therefore necessary that in the future more attention be given by the government to the institutional aspects of intervention that aims at the improvement of rehabilitation of FMIS. However it was not only the intervention and the way they were implemented that led to a diminishing participation of the users in the maintenance of their irrigation system. The changes in the local, political, and administrative institutions, the opening of the villages via new roads lessened cohesion of the rural communities and opportunities were created or made accessible what led among others to a diminished social control. The provision of all kinds of facilities (school, health-posts) led farmers to look for new roles for the government e.g. to support them with the maintenance of the irrigation system.Alternate abstract:Met de hulp van verschillende donoren heeft Zijne Majesteits regering van Nepal programma's uitgevoerd met het oogmerk de beschikbaarheid van water te verbeteren, de landbouw productiviteit te verhogen en de institutionele capaciteit van de boeren te versterken opdat deze in staat zouden zijn in hun irrigatiesystemen irrigatie management praktijken uit te voeren die effici{\"{e}}nt, rechtvaardig, betrouwbaar en duurzaam zouden zijn. In dit kader was deze studie erop gericht inzicht te krijgen in de sociale, administratieve en politieke processen die invloed hadden op de sociale en institutionele veranderingen die teweeg werden gebracht door op ontwikkeling gerichte ingrepen op het lokale niveau. Deze studie bestaat uit zeven hoofdstukken. Het eerste hoofdstuk gaat in op de aard van het probleem, de onderzoeksfocus en het doel van het onderzoek. De verschillende concepten en het theoretisch raamwerk alsmede de diverse onderzoeksmethoden die zijn gebruikt bij het verzamelen van materiaal worden behandeld in hoofdstuk twee. De sociaal-politieke en administratieve situatie in het land evenals de overheidspolitiek en de prioriteiten in de irrigatie en landbouw ontwikkeling in de verschillende plan perioden worden bediscussieerd in het derde hoofdstuk. De vier case studies worden besproken in de hoofdstukken vier tot en met zes. Deze case studies bestaan uit een bespreking van de omgeving waarin de interventies plaatsvonden en de beschrijving ervan. Deze presentaties worden gevolgd door een analyse. Het laatste hoofdstuk bevat de belangrijkste bevindingen en conclusies. De veranderingen die op verschillende momenten plaatsvonden in het overheidsbeleid hadden tot gevolg dat er verschillende interventie strategie{\"{e}}n werden ontwikkeld voor de diverse programma's. Bovendien was er geen consistentie in het beleid in de programma's die op hetzelfde moment werden uitgevoerd. Het overheidsbeleid dat er op gericht was de gebruikers te laten participeren in de besluitvorming gedurende de opstelling van het project ontwerp en de uitvoering daarvan varieerde gedurende de tachtiger jaren zoals aangegeven is in de verschillende programma's die hierna worden besproken. Bijvoorbeeld bij de uitvoering van de financi{\"{e}}le ondersteuning op beperkte schaal voor de verbetering van de door de boeren zelf beheerde irrigatiesystemen werd min of meer een participatieve benadering gevolgd. Maar bij nieuw te bouwen irrigatiesystemen was van participatie nauwelijks sprake. Toch was de participatie van gebruikers sinds het begin van de jaren negentig een voorwaarde alvorens eenn interventie proces mocht beginnen. Deze studie laat zien dat het begin van interventies een gecompliceerd proces is dat niet altijd doorzichtig is als gevolg van het feit dat de actoren die erbij betrokken zijn, zoals de gebruikers, de lokale leiders, lokale en regionale instellingen, overheidsorganisaties en externe donoren, verschillende doeleinden en verborgen agenda's hebben. Initiatie van interventies op het lokale niveau kwam van gebruikers, lokale leiders en Village Panchayat (VP) functionarissen. De VP bemiddelde tussen de gebruikers en de overheidsorganisaties gedurende de initiatie fase van de interventie. De case studies geven de indruk dat het de overheidsfunctionarissen waren die de interventie projectmatig uitwerkten waarbij hun aandacht vooral uitging naar de technische en financi{\"{e}}le aspecten en dat deze niet uitvoerig met de gebruikers werden besproken. Dit had tot gevolg dat de kennis die bij de gebruikers aanwezig was niet werd gebruikt. De case studies geven aan dat de contacten tussen de gebruikers en de andere actoren niet zo intensief waren dat gesproken kan worden van een participatieve benadering. Er zijn drie typen van uitvoering van een interventie: een nieuwe constructie, herstel en verbetering. Het doel van de interventie bepaalde de aard en de omvang van financi{\"{e}}le, technische en de institutionele betrokkenheid van de gebruikers bij de uitvoering. De case studies geven aan dat de meeste gebruikers commissies (UC) die werden opgericht vooral functioneerden als 'constructie commissies en ophielden te functioneren nadat de uitvoering van de interventie was voltooid. Het doel om instituties te scheppen voor de uitvoering was {\'{o}}p deze wijze gedeeltelijk gerealiseerd, maar dit garandeerde nog niet de volledige participatie van de gebruikers. De analyses van de case studies tonen aan dat vier instituties van belang waren voor het bestuur en beheer van irrigatiesystemen: a) het Ditthawal systeem, b) DIO, c) VP/VDC en d) UC. De case studies geven ook aan dat de legitimiteit van de instituties gebaseerd was op het vertrouwen van de gebruikers. Van minder belang was het of het formele of informele instituties waren. De case studies tonen aan dat de ingrijpende hervorming van de 'collectieve keuze regel' als gevolg van de veranderingen die voortkwamen uit de interventie in een irrigatie systeem in de bestuursstructuur ervan bijdroegen tot een toenemende anarchie in de 'regels in gebruik'. Bovendien was er maar een geringe bijdrage van de gebruikers in het ontwerp van de interventie als gevolg van het ontbreken van de 'constitutionele keuze regel'. Deze studie toont eveneens aan dat de organisatie die de 'constitutionele keuze regel' (beleid) overnam geen inzicht had in de behoeften die in het dorp bestonden. De constructie van permanente inlaatwerken en het met betonwanden bekleden van de irrigatie kanalen maakten de exploitatie van het systeem gemakkelijker en de taken van de gebruikers werden minder zwaar. Het gevolg was dat minder participatie van de gebruikers nodig was voor het geregeld onderhouden en schoonmaken van de kanalen. De allocatie van water aan de gebruikers is gebaseerd op het te irrigeren areaal dat ze bezitten. In het gebied waarin de case studies plaatsvonden waren drie typen van waterverdelingspraktijken: rotatie, veld tot veld irrigatie, en ongeregelde allocatie. De case studies tonen aan dat de bijdrage van de gebruikers aan de exploitatie en onderhouden van het irrigatie systeem nog geen zekerheid gaf voor een eerlijke verdeling van het water. De mate van sociale controle waarop de instituties konden rekenen was een belangrijke factor om te verzekeren dat er een eerlijk waterverdeling onder de gebruikers tot stand kwam. De analyse van de case studies laat zien dat er drie typen van conflicten kunnen worden onderscheiden. Er is het conflict tussen twee irrigatiesystemen over het gebruik van {\'{e}}{\'{e}}n enkele waterbron. Ten tweede kan er een dispuut ontstaan tussen de gebruikers over de verdeling van het water als gevolg van gebrekkige institutionele regelingen. Het derde type van conflict is dat tussen de organisatie die het systeem beheert en de gebruikers. Dit is het gevolg van het gebrek aan contacten gedurende de plarvr{\"{u}}ng en de uitvoering van de interventies hetwelk gevolgen had voor de overdracht van het management van het irrigatie systeem. De aard en de mate van de participatie van de gebruikers geeft weer dat bij de interventies niet met succes de actieve participatie van deze gebruikers is gezocht bij de beslissingen door de actoren die waren betrokken bij het ontwerpen en uitvoeren van de interventie. De analyse van de case studies suggereert dat de meest voorkomende vorm van participatie voor de mobilisatie van middelen was het geven arbeid, land en het beschikbaar stellen van tijd. Het patroon van middelen mobilisatie laat zien dat de ge{\"{i}}ntroduceerde nieuwe irrigatie technieken de bevolking meer afhankelijk heeft gemaakt van externe hulp. Bijdragen in geld waren praktisch te verwaarlozen. De complexiteit van de nieuwe technologie had belangrijke gevolgen en maakte dat de gebruikers meer afhankelijk zijn geworden van externe expertise en middelen. Deze toename van de afhankelijkheid van externe organisaties geeft aan dat nieuwe samenwerkingsverbanden moesten worden gemaakt door het leggen van contacten tussen de actoren die betrokken zijn met de ontwikkeling van irrigatiesystemen. Dit geeft aan dat interventies van een technische aard ook vragen om een nieuwe vorm van organisatorische controle. In al de vier case studies was het onderhoud van de irrigatiesystemen, wanneer het om geldelijke bijdrages ging, in zeer belangrijke mate afhankelijk van externe middelen. De nieuw opgerichte gebruikers commissies functioneerden alleen maar gedurende de uitvoering van de interventies maar waren niet in staat om middelen te mobiliseren voor het onderhoud van de systemen. Dit betekent een grotere afhankelijkheid van overheidssteun. Wanneer die steun niet komt dan is een duurzaam voortbestaan van deze irrigatiesystemen onwaarschijnlijk. Het is daarom noodzakelijk dat de overheid meer aandacht heeft voor de institutionele aspecten van interventies die gericht zijn op de verbetering en onderhoud van door boeren beheerde irrigatiesystemen. Maar het waren niet alleen de interventies en de wijze waarop zij werden uitgevoerd die hebben geleid tot een vermindering van de participatie van de gebruikers in het onderhoud van hun irrigatiesystemen. De veranderingen in de lokale, politieke en administratieve instituties, het uit hun isolatie halen van de dorpen door de aanleg van wegen maakte dat de sociale cohesie van de rurale gemeenschappen verminderde. Ook werden nieuwe mogelijkheden voor de bevolking geschapen of werden bestaande mogelijkheden toegankelijker gemaakt waardoor de sociale controle afnam. Het beschikbaar stellen van vele soorten faciliteiten (scholen, klinieken) maakte dat de boeren de overheid een nieuwe rol toedachten, bijvoorbeeld bij het hun terzijde staan bij het onderhoud van de irrigatiesystemen.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the intra-specific variation of wheat grain quality response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (e[CO2]), eight wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)cultivars were grown at two CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) (current atmospheric, 389 CO2 $\mu$mol mol−1vs. e[CO2], FACE (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment), 550 ± 10{\%} CO2 $\mu$mol mol−1), at two water levels (rain-fed vs. irrigated) and at two times of sowing (TOS1, vs. TOS2). The TOS treatment was mainly imposed to understand whether e[CO2] could modify the effects of timing of higher grain filling temperatures on grain quality. When plants were grown at TOS1, TKW (thousand kernel weight), grain test weight, hardness index, P, Ca, Na and phytate were not significantly changed under e[CO2]. On the other hand, e[CO2] increased TKW (16{\%}), hardness index (9{\%}), kernel diameter (6{\%}), test weight (2{\%}) but decreased grain protein (10{\%}) and grain phytate (11{\%}) at TOS2. In regard to grain Zn, Mn and Cu concentrations and some flour rheological properties, cultivar specific responses to e[CO2] were observed at both sowing times. Observed genetic variability in response to e[CO2] in terms of grain minerals and flour rheological properties could be easily incorporated into future wheat breeding programs to enable adaptation to climate change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDSurgical site infections (SSIs) are wound infections that occur after an operative procedure. A preventable complication, they are costly and associated with poorer patient outcomes, increased mortality, morbidity and reoperation rates. Surgical wound irrigation is an intraoperative technique, which may reduce the rate of SSIs through removal of dead or damaged tissue, metabolic waste, and wound exudate. Irrigation can be undertaken prior to wound closure or postoperatively. Intracavity lavage is a similar technique used in operations that expose a bodily cavity; such as procedures on the abdominal cavity and during joint replacement surgery.OBJECTIVESTo assess the effects of wound irrigation and intracavity lavage on the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI).SEARCH METHODSIn February 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication or study setting.SELECTION CRITERIAWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants undergoing surgical procedures in which the use of a particular type of intraoperative washout (irrigation or lavage) was the only systematic difference between groups, and in which wounds underwent primary closure. The primary outcomes were SSI and wound dehiscence. Secondary outcomes were mortality, use of systemic antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, adverse events, re-intervention, length of hospital stay, and readmissions.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion at each stage. Two review authors also undertook data extraction, assessment of risk of bias and GRADE assessment. We calculated risk ratios or differences in means with 95{\%} confidence intervals where possible.MAIN RESULTSWe included 59 RCTs with 14,738 participants. Studies assessed comparisons between irrigation and no irrigation, between antibacterial and non-antibacterial irrigation, between different antibiotics, different antiseptics or different non-antibacterial agents, or between different methods of irrigation delivery. No studies compared antiseptic with antibiotic irrigation. Surgical site infectionIrrigation compared with no irrigation (20 studies; 7192 participants): there is no clear difference in risk of SSI between irrigation and no irrigation (RR 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.68 to 1.11; I2 = 28{\%}; 14 studies, 6106 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 13 fewer SSIs per 1000 people treated with irrigation compared with no irrigation; the 95{\%} CI spanned from 31 fewer to 10 more SSIs. This was low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision.Antibacterial irrigation compared with non-antibacterial irrigation (36 studies, 6163 participants): there may be a lower incidence of SSI in participants treated with antibacterial irrigation compared with non-antibacterial irrigation (RR 0.57, 95{\%} CI 0.44 to 0.75; I2 = 53{\%}; 30 studies, 5141 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 60 fewer SSIs per 1000 people treated with antibacterial irrigation than with non-antibacterial (95{\%} CI 35 fewer to 78 fewer). This was low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and suspected publication bias.Comparison of irrigation of two agents of the same class (10 studies; 2118 participants): there may be a higher incidence of SSI in participants treated with povidone iodine compared with superoxidised water (Dermacyn) (RR 2.80, 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 7.47; low-certainty evidence from one study, 190 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 95 more SSIs per 1000 people treated with povidone iodine than with superoxidised water (95{\%} CI 3 more to 341 more). All other comparisons found low- or very low-certainty evidence of no clear difference between groups.Comparison of two irrigation techniques: two studies compared standard (non-pulsed) methods with pulsatile methods. There may, on average, be fewer SSIs in participants treated with pulsatile methods compared with standard methods (RR 0.34, 95{\%} CI 0.19 to 0.62; I2 = 0{\%}; two studies, 484 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 109 fewer SSIs occurring per 1000 with pulsatile irrigation compared with standard (95{\%} CI 62 fewer to 134 fewer). This was low-certainty evidence downgraded twice for risks of bias across multiple domains. Wound dehiscenceFew studies reported wound dehiscence. No comparison had evidence for a difference between intervention groups. This included comparisons between irrigation and no irrigation (one study, low-certainty evidence); antibacterial and non-antibacterial irrigation (three studies, very low-certainty evidence) and pulsatile and standard irrigation (one study, low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomesFew studies reported outcomes such as use of systemic antibiotics and antibiotic resistance and they were poorly and incompletely reported. There was limited reporting of mortality; this may have been partially due to failure to specify zero events in participants at low risk of death. Adverse event reporting was variable and often limited to individual event types. The evidence for the impact of interventions on length of hospital stay was low or moderate certainty; where differences were seen they were too small to be clinically important.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSThe evidence base for intracavity lavage and wound irrigation is generally of low certainty. Therefore where we identified a possible difference in the incidence of SSI (in comparisons of antibacterial and non-antibacterial interventions, and pulsatile versus standard methods) these should be considered in the context of uncertainty, particularly given the possibility of publication bias for the comparison of antibacterial and non-antibacterial interventions. Clinicians should also consider whether the evidence is relevant to the surgical populations under consideration, the varying reporting of other prophylactic antibiotics, and concerns about antibiotic resistance.We did not identify any trials that compared an antibiotic with an antiseptic. This gap in the direct evidence base may merit further investigation, potentially using network meta-analysis; to inform the direction of new primary research. Any new trial should be adequately powered to detect a difference in SSIs in eligible participants, should use robust research methodology to reduce the risks of bias and internationally recognised criteria for diagnosis of SSI, and should have adequate duration and follow-up.},

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue: Paddy and Water Management with the System of Rice Intensification (SRI)   There are various avenues for intensifying agricultural production, the most common being increased use of fertilizers, supplemental irrigation of crops, and adoption of high-yielding varieties. These options are rather widely known to farmers around the world, but they have not been widely adopted by smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa. The low adoption rate is related to complex technical and socio-economic issues, such as poor extension services, lack of capital, failure to mobilize the requisite water, or simply, poverty. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is in a special category of innovation in that, farmers stand to gain multiple benefits from its use, including the possibility of increasing rice yields substantially, saving water, and getting better grain quality, using differently the assets that they already have. A major impediment for the adoption of SRI in Africa has been lack of knowledge about this intervention, especially for farmers already practicing irrigated agriculture. Farmers generally have good business sense and will adopt technologies or practices once the benefits are proven and the risks are seen as minor. SRI should be attractive for these reasons, but there are various issues to be resolved before large numbers of farmers can adopt the method. This article reports on the steps taken and the technical and socio-economic issues addressed in efforts to introduce SRI and promote it in Kenya, specifically in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme. A diverse set of individuals and institutions in Kenya together embarked on the evaluation and dissemination of SRI methods in this East African country beginning in July 2009. If the new methods can perform in Kenya as in other countries, this will bring much benefit to rice farmers and rice consumers in the region. SRI is coming to Kenya relatively late, as it was the thirty-ninth country from which favorable SRI results have been reported. This means that Kenyans can learn from others' experience and evaluations, and there is also now more of a supportive institutional framework. The initial results from on-farm SRI trials have been positive, although not conclusive. They have given impetus to Kenyan farmers and institutions to collaborate within a multi-sectoral, multi-level coalition that has provided an informal, multi-faceted platform for the evaluation, adaptation and dissemination of SRI practices. The initiative in Kenya is now gaining more formal status and more resources. This experience is presented to show the kinds of things that have been and can be done to utilize the SRI opportunity for raising land, labor, and water productivity in the rice sector.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Much of the investment in small-scale water extraction devices, farm ponds, and irrigation equipment in Africa and South Asia has been made by individual farmers, without involving a formal irrigation scheme or a water user association. The farm-level benefits of these investments in small, private irrigation include the production and revenue gains made possible through reliable, timely access to surface water, groundwater, or rainfall that has been captured and stored. Governments and donors can enhance the pace of such investments by providing information regarding water availability, the types of appropriate water extraction devices and irrigation technology available, the likely impacts on farm-level production, and the prices farmers should expect to pay for good quality materials. Farmers might also benefit from certification programs that convey information regarding the reliability of suppliers, and credit programs that provide affordable loans. Such programs might be particularly helpful in Africa, where rural populations are less dense than in Asia, such that the per-household cost of delivering information and services might restrain the pace of private sector provision of water extraction devices and irrigation equipment.},

abstract = {All living species in the world need is water. These days, water consumption in family units has expanded because of the illadvised utilization of water in different exercises, for example, cultivating, vehicle washing or family unit cleaning. This causes water shortage and an expansion in family unit financial consumption.Today, farmers have a few issues in agriculture because of absence of downpours and shortage of water. The primary adage of this task is to spare time and exertion of each farmer by utilizing the water collecting strategy in a manual or programmed method of utilization. Manual intercession is required for conventional farmland procedures. Human intervention can be constrained with the motorized development of water framework. By utilizing soil dampness sensor levels of soil dampness/mugginess can be checked. At whatever point there is an adjustment in stickiness in the dirt this sensor detects the change and an intrude on signal is passed to the microcontroller and relying upon this the water system framework works. The mechanized water system framework gives a web interface to the client with the goal that the client can screen and control the framework remotely i.e., can make the water system framework ON and OFF remotely. The rainwater harvesting system can reduce the water shortage and useful in various situations.In view of measurable data accessible during quite a while, a reproduction framework is worked to decide the ideal precipitation assortment tank volume and assess the utilization of such a framework in specific areas. It creates and collaborates with the techniques for displaying and mapping fields and water profitability of downpour took care of harvests in semiarid situations of India utilising hyperspectral and multispectral remote detecting information and connecting the information to a similar field zone information and atmosphere station information. This is to give data to propel water reaping innovations in the horticultural grounds of the semidry situations of India.},

abstract = {In India, water wastage in agricultural fields becomes a challenging issue and it is needed to minimize the loss of water in the irrigation process. Since the conventional irrigation system needs massive quantity of water utilization, a smart irrigation system can be designed with the help of recent technologies such as machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). With this motivation, this paper designs a novel IoT enabled deep learning enabled smart irrigation system (IoTDL-SIS) technique. The goal of the IoTDL-SIS technique focuses on the design of smart irrigation techniques for effectual water utilization with less human interventions. The proposed IoTDL-SIS technique involves distinct sensors namely soil moisture, temperature, air temperature, and humidity for data acquisition purposes. The sensor data are transmitted to the Arduino module which then transmits the sensor data to the cloud server for further process. The cloud server performs the data analysis process using three distinct processes namely regression, clustering, and binary classification. Firstly, deep support vector machine (DSVM) based regression is employed was utilized for predicting the soil and environmental parameters in advances such as atmospheric pressure, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed. Secondly, these estimated outcomes are fed into the clustering technique to minimize the predicted error. Thirdly, Artificial Immune Optimization Algorithm (AIOA) with deep belief network (DBN) model receives the clustering data with the estimated weather data as input and performs classification process. A detailed experimental results analysis demonstrated the promising performance of the presented technique over the other recent state of art techniques with the higher accuracy of 0.971.},

abstract = {In the traditional irrigation process, a huge amount of water consumption is required which leads to water wastage. To reduce the wasting of water for this tedious task, an intelligent irrigation system is urgently needed. The era of machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) brings it is a great advantage of building an intelligent system that performs this task automatically with minimal human effort. In this study, an IoT enabled ML-trained recommendation system is proposed for efficient water usage with the nominal intervention of farmers. IoT devices are deployed in the crop field to precisely collect the ground and environmental details. The gathered data are forwarded and stored in a cloud-based server, which applies ML approaches to analyze data and suggest irrigation to the farmer. To make the system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism is added to this recommendation system. The experimentation, reveals that the proposed system performs quite well on our own collected dataset and National Institute of Technology (NIT) Raipur crop dataset.},

abstract = {This study is about rural agricultural development and social processes of change in rural Zimbabwe. It is aimed at understanding how irrigation intervention in a remote rural context changed the cultural, social, poHtical and farming Uves of people. It is a study of people coping with changes in their Hvelihoods which had been introduced from outside by development intervention. The study was sustained by the realisation that irrigation is not just a matter of technical artefacts, but has much to do with people, especially the people it is meant to benefit. Development practitioners and researchers should be interested not only in irrigation performance, but also in how people manipulate the irrigation resources available to them. How does irrigation development change the Hves of the irrigators over time? How is it transformed and adapted by them? How does it change their perceptions of each other in view of their local social identities and differences? What do irrigation farmers use to gain improved access to irrigation resources? How do they manipulate their social, poHtical, technical and management environments to their benefit? What lessons can we derive from "targeted" beneficiaries' analyses of how their Hves have been transformed by development intervention?The study focuses on social constructions of cultural identities, on social interaction and change among smallholder farmers in the context of irrigation development intervention in Eastern Zimbabwe. It shows how the introduction of an irrigation scheme not only created, but also nurtured and promoted processes of cultural identity and social differentiation among groups of rural producers who had previously had but few distmguishing social characteristics (such as ethnic affiHation). It is a study of how the irrigation context helps to highlight their social and cultural differences and leads to social conflicts and leadership struggles, and to how different individual actors devise strategies, such as erux)lling outsiders into local struggles, to achieve their often conflicting group and individual objectives. The analysis portrays the irrigation scheme as a social and poHtical 'domain' in which different groups of farmers and outsiders engage each other in negotiations over resources, and the meanings attached to these resources. In some instances, the irrigation domain is seen as an arena, a contested area where struggles take place over a diversity of Hvelihood resources such as water and land. The study used the actor-oriented perspective as the theoretical basis for the analysis of research findings. An actor-oriented approach helps one recognise the agency of social actors in interactive situations. It requires a fuU analysis of the ways in which different social actors manage and interpret new elements in their life-worlds. The capacity of social actors to influence and shape their social surroundings is one of the saHent features of the approach used in this Nyamaropa study.The study is also about the omnipresence of encounters and clashes of different 'world-views' at the local level in the irrigation scheme. The clashes take place in the social, technical, administrative, managerial and poHtical domains. It looks at how the different 'life-worlds' accommodate to each other in actors' daily interactions to give a semblance of harmony and attraction, co-existing with conflict and rejection. It is an analysis of the dynamism of social differences in irrigation intervention, and in any development intervention for that matter, that reveals the multiplexity of actors' interactions, and how their multiple relations and mterlocking projects generate potentially explosive social exchanges. The study starts from the bottom, as it were, in its analysis of how different people in a specific rural development context create and live with complex social relations where daily interaction is characterised by strategic negotiation and mutual enrolment in other actors' projects. The analysis focuses more on local level dynamics, and does not deal, for example, with the politics of decisionmaking at higher levels of administration, such as the province or central government departments under which smallholder irrigation development fails. The study does, however, acknowledge the inevitable, sometimes useful role of macro-policy structures in influencing development outcomes at the local level. As a sociological study, this research work focused on how people interacted, worked together, settled differences and used community resources in their daily struggles for survival. Irrigation literature in Zimbabwe has only recently begun to pay specific attention to the fact that irrigation development is essentially a social process. Part of the objective here is to contribute to the debate about how rural actors manage their differentiated irrigating lives, discourses, struggles and negotiations, conflicts and accommodations in their constantly changing social environments. In order to examine this complex social process, it was proposed to undertake a detailed analysis of one irrigation scheme and its impact both on farmers practising irrigated agriculture and on surrounding dryland communities.The thesis is divided into four parts. Part One gives 'the story behind the study'. Then there is a background to the study in the form of Chapter 2. This chapter provides what I have called The Setting. This is Zimbabwe's agricultural history, the history of smallholder irrigation development in the country, a background to Nyamaropa irrigation intervention, and an introduction to the different social and political actors who appear throughout the book. Part Two is about the embeddedness of social, political and power relationships, social and economic differences, in land and water resources. Chapter 3 deals with struggles over land and water among irrigation farmers. There is a debate on water ownership from the different actors' standpoints in the Nyamaropa area. This chapter is central in the sense that it introduces the crucial issues of cultural and social identity in relations between formal irrigators and non-irrigators, between original inhabitants of the now irrigated area and immigrants to the same area. These are some of the issues that set the scene for case analyses of the dynamics of development intervention, constructions and reconstructions of cultural and social identities and differences. Chapter 4, also in Part Two, is about the issue of different claims to water use, between irrigation farmers in the Nyamaropa project, and villagers in the catchment area who use river water which is the source of water for the irrigation scheme downstream. Here the argument is that spatial distinctions, cultural identities, and a strong sense of communal existence, constitute a crucial entry point for the analysis of ways of assembling claims to resource use by different actors. Differences in community organisation feature as competing aspects of claims to resource utilisation. Part Three is about the irrigation domain as a shared life-world. Chapter 5 is on gender images and irrigation life. There are cases of widows who struggle to survive in a tough and competitive irrigation environment. A salient feature of this chapter is how women relate to the irrigation scheme through their families or individual plots. Walking through the irrigation scheme one is struck by a common feature of the area: over seventy percent of people one sees working or meets in the fields are women and children, with the majority of them being women. A surprising, yet refreshing, phenomenon in the Nyamaropa irrigation scheme is that almost thirty percent of registered plotholders are widows! Some of them registered as widows when their men worked in town, so that they would have access to irrigated plots. This was a stratagem to beat the rule prohibiting those with wage-earning spouses from having access to irrigated land. It worked, to their advantage.Chapter 6 focuses on irrigation extension specifically. This provides cases of farmers' encounters with Agritex (the national extension agency), and reveals the different views of similar situations between farmers and outsiders, and among farmers themselves in the presence of outsiders. This chapter focuses on one of the central issues in the study: that of how social differences among people impact on their responses to new knowledge and information. In this case, it is a matter of how farmers relate to Extension Workers as promoters of change, improvement and innovation. Part Four is on official (and unofficial) regulations and practices, looking especially at government practice through Agritex and the traditional institution through the Headman. Chapter 7 deals with a delicate and sensitive subject of age, inheritance, sub-leasing and renting, and the irrigation rules which were ignored. The average age of plotholders in Nyamaropa was approximately 55 years, though there were plotholders as old as 84 years. Most of them were first generation plotholders. These were farmers who cleared the plots themselves when the project started in the late fifties. Most of the elderly irrigators were too old to fully utilise their irrigation plots, but still retained their names in the register. They regarded irrigation land as their family asset, against the official rule that they were lessees on state land. To maintain productivity, they sub-leased their plots to dryland farmers who needed irrigated land for food. Some of them had established networks with local businessmen who rented part of their land in return for paying irrigation fees for the plotholders. There were some long-term relationships of mutual assistance between the different types of farmers. Rules and regulations are seen here as among the tools at farmers' disposal in their constant negotiations for hetter deals' among themselves and with their resident Extension Workers. Chapter 8 is the only chapter in Part Five. This section provides conclusions and theoretical analyses of research findings. It contextualises social difference and cultural identity in the life-situations of irrigators and drylanders in Nyamaropa. Discussed here are issues of how the different social groupings fit into the whole story of social dynamics of development intervention, and what some social theorists say on the issue of cultural identity and social difference (which is not much so far). This chapter brings together different theoretical issues raised in case material in the chapters before it. Chapter 8 also looks into problems facing 'irrigating lives' in smallholder irrigation schemes in the context of external intervention, and the issues and contradictions surrounding concepts such as cultural identity, and strategic difference in rural development. One hopes that such a study will initiate a process that will lead to bringing out and appraising differences among development programme beneficiaries to make interventions not merely effective (by externalised criteria), but also meaningful to the range of people whose lives are unavoidably affected by its introduction. The study will help in the general understanding of social dynamics of rural development, of land reform and of poverty-reduction strategies in Zimbabwe and the Southern African region.Alternate abstract:Deze Studie gaat over landbouw, rurale ontwikkeling en sociale veranderingsprocessen op het platteland in Zimbabwe. Het doel is om te begrijpen hoe irrigatie projecten het sociale, politieke en culturele leven van mensen ver{\"{a}}ndert en be'invloedt. Bestuurd wordt hoe mensen omgaan met veranderingen in hun dage{\"{u}}jks leven die voortvloeien uit interventies van buitenaf. De Studie bouwt voort op het gedachtegoed dat irrigatie niet slechts technische artefacten behelst, maar veel te maken heeft met mensen en vooral met hen die ervan zouden moeten profiteren. Ctotwikkelingswerkers en onderzoekers zouden niet alleen geihteresseerd moeten zijn in irrigatie per se, maar er ook oog voor moeten hebben hoe mensen met de hulpbronnen die bij irrigatie een rol speien omgaan of deze zelfs manipuleren. Belangrijke vragen in dit verband zijn hoe hrigatieontvrikkeiing het leven van de betrokkenen ver{\"{a}}ndert en be'invloedt; hoe irrigatie wordt herontworpen en aangepast door de betrokken actoren; hoe de percepties die men van elkaar heeft met betrekking tot sociale verschillen en identiteit worden bijgesteld; welke activiteiten mensen ontplooien om toegang te krijgen tot de irrigatiehulpbronnen; hoe de sociale, politieke, technische en beheersomgeving worden gemanipuleerd ten eigen b{\"{a}}te; en welke lessen er zijn te trekken uit een analyse hoe projecten en programma's het leven van de doelgroepen voor wie ze worden uitgevoerd hebben veranderd. Centraal staat hoe in de context van irrigatieontwikkeling in het Oosten van Zimbabwe, identiteiten worden geconstrueerd, mensen met elkaar omgaan en veranderingen plaats vinden binnen een kleine boerengemeenschap. De Studie laat niet alleen zien hoe de aanleg van een irrigatiestelsel sociale verschillen en verschilfende identiteiten tussen groepen producenten, die voorheen nauwelijks onderling verschilden, creeerde, maar hoe deze de verschillen juist ook voedde. Hoe accentueert irrigatie sociale en culturele verschillen en hoe kan zij allerlei conflicten aanleiding geven. Hoe ontwikkelen verschillende actoren strategieen, zoals het betrekken van buitenstaanders bij lokale conflicten, ten einde hun conflicterende groeps- en individuele belangen te verenigen. De analyse schetst het irrigatie stelsel als een sociaal en politiek domein waarin verschilfende groepen boeren en buitenstaanders onderhandelen over hulpbronnen. In bepaalde gevallen is het irrigatie domein een arena, een betwist gebied waarin gestreden wordt over tal van hulpbronnen, zoals land en water, die van essentieel belang zijn om de eindjes aan elkaar te knopen. De Studie maakt gebruik van het actor georienteerde perspectief waarin het verm{\"{o}}gen van actoren om te handelen centraal staan. Het vereist een volledige analyse van de manieren waarop actoren nieuwe elementen in hun leven beheren en interpreteren. Het verm{\"{o}}gen van actoren om hun eigen leefomgeving te beinvloeden en vorm te geven is een van de meest herkenbare dementen van deze benadering in deze Studie. De Studie betreff ook de alom aanwezige ontmoetingen en confrontaties van verschillende discoursen op het lokale niveau van een irrigatiestelsel. De confrontaties manifesteren zieh in de sociale, politieke en techrusch-administratieve domeinen. Geanalyseerd wordt hoe de verschillende leefwerelden de dagelijkse interacties helpen vorm te geven aan harmonie en samenwerking en tegeUjkertijd aan conflict en afwijzing. Het is een analyse van de dynamiek van sodale verschillen in irrigatie projecten die de complexiteit van de interacties hissen actoren bloot legt, en hoe de verschillende sodale verhoudingen en samenwerkingsverbanden potentieel explosieve situaties kunnen voortbrengen. De Studie begint daarom, als het ware, aan de basis ten einde te laten zien hoe adoren in een ontwikkelingscontext omgaan met sodale relaties die gekenmerkt worden door interactie en strategische onderhandelingen en het telkens pogen om anderen voor de eigen doeleinden te gebruiken. De analyse concentreert zieh daarom meer op het lokale niveau, en niet op de beleidscontext van bijvoorbeeld de provindes of centrale overheid die verantwoordelijk zijn voor irrigatie. De Studie onderkent echter wel de onvermijdelijke en soms belangrijke macro-politieke structuren die ontwikkelingen op het lokale niveau beinvloeden. Als een sociologisch onderzoek betaamt, rieht het onderzoek zieh vooral op de wijze waarop mensen met elkaar omgaan, samenwerken, confliden beslechten en gemeenschappelijke hulpbronnen gebruiken in hun dagelijkse strijd om het bestaan. De Zimbabwaanse Uteratuur over irrigatie is slechts recenteHjk aandacht gaan schenken aan irrigatie als een in essentie sociaal proces. Onderdeel van de doestelling van het onderzoek is om bij te dragen aan de analyse van irrigatieontwikkeling vanuit het gezichtspunt hoe actoren hun leven organiseren, de discoursen die worden gehanteerd, de confliden en de onderhandelingen en de pogingen om conflicten bij te leggen. Om dit complexe geheel uit een te kunnen zetten is gekozen voor een gedetailleerde analyse van een irrigatie stelsel en de invloed die het heeft op zowel de boeren die irrigeren als op de boeren die zieh bezig houden met 'droge' of regenafhankelijke landbouw. Het proefschrift bevat vier delen. Het eerste deel beschrijft de achtergronden van de studie en de historische context van het irrigatiegebeuren plaats vindt. Het behandelt de agrarische geschiedenis van Zimbabwe, de geschiedenis van kleinschahge irrigatie en die in Nyamaropa in het bijzonder, en gaat ook in op de verschillende actoren die een rol spelen in het irrigatie projed in Nyamaropa. Deel twee is een verhandeling over de mbedding van sodale, politieke en machtsverhoudingen in hulpbronnen land en water. Hoofdstuk 3 gaat over de conflicten over land en water zoals die zieh afspelen tussen irrigeerders onderling. Een van de cruciale debatten in en rondom het irrigatiestelsel in Nyamaropa is wie nu het eigendomsrecht van water heeft. Dit hoofdstuk introduceert de belangrijke zaken zoals de culturele en sodale identiteit in de verhoudingen tussen diegenen die irrigeren en zij die niet irrigeren, tussen de oorspronkelijke bewoners en de immigranten. Deze onderwerpen spelen een grote rol in de analyse van de dynamiek van ontwildcelingsinterventie, de constructie maar ook de deconstructie van culturele en sodale identiteiten en verschillen. Hoofdstuk 4 handelt over de verschillende aanspraken op water die zowel door de irrigeerders als de diegenen die in het stroomgebied van het irrigatiestelsel wonen worden gelegd. Het centrale argument is dat het ruimtelijk onderscheid, culturele identiteiten en een sterk gemeenschapsgevoel, in belangrijke ingang vormt tot de analyse van de verschillende aanspraken op water door de verschillende adoren. Verschillen in gemeenschapsorganisatie komen naar voren als contradictoire aspecten van aanspraken op het gebruik van hulpbronnen. Deel Drie analyseert het irrigatie domein als een gedeelde leefwereld. Hoofdstuk 5 behandelt gender in een irrigatiecontext en beschrijft hoe weduwen worstelen om hun bestaan in een harde en competitieve omgeving. Een bezoek aan irrigatiestelsel maakt onmiddelHjk duideHjk dat diegenen die de velden bewerken voor het overgrote deel vrouwen en kinderen zijn. Bijna 30 procent van de geregistreerde irrigeerders zijn weduwen! Om toegang tot het irrigatiestelsel te krijgen, registreerden sommige weduwen zieh terwijl hun partners in de stad werkzaam waren. Dit was een list om de regel te omzeilen die zegt dat diegenen die een betrekking in de stad of elders hebben geen land in het irrigatiestelsel m{\"{o}}gen hebben. Hoofdstuk 6 concentreert zieh op de voor{\"{U}}chting op het vlak van irrigatie. Het hoofdstuk bevat een aantal cases van ontmoetingen tussen boeren en staf van Agritex (de nationale voorlichtingsdienst). Het maakt de verschillende gezichtspunten duideHjk tussen boeren en buitenstaanders, en tussen de boeren onderling in het bijzijn van buitenstaanders. Dit hoofdstuk beHcht een van de hoofd thema's van de Studie, nameHjk hoe sociale verschillen de reaches op nieuwe kermis en innovaties beinvloeden. Het bHjkt van belang te zijn om aandacht te schenken aan de relaties tussen boeren en voorHchters als bevorderaars van Ver{\"{a}}nderung ontwikkeling en innovatie. Deel Vier gaat over de formele (en informele) regels en praktijken. Dit wordt begrepen vanuit het perspectief van de overheid middels Agritex en de tribale instituties zoals het hoofd. Hoofdstuk 7 handelt over een deHcaat en gevoeHg onderwerp, namelijk leeftijd, vererving, onderhuur en verhuur en de irrigatieregelgeving die niet wordt nageleefd. De gemiddelde leeftijd van de irrigeerders was ongeveer 55 jaar en sommigen waren zelfs 84 jaar oud. De meeste onder hen behoorden tot de eerste generatie irrigeerders die zelf het land bouwrijp heeft gemaakt vlak na de aanlag van het stelsel aan het einde van de 50er jaren. Velen van hen zijn nu eigenlijk te oud om het land voUedig te bewerken, maar staan nog steeds geregistreerd. Een geirrigeerd stukje land vertegenwoordigde voor hen een famiHebezit hetgeen tegen de regelgeving van het stelsel is. Om de productie te handhaven verhuren ze hun land geheel of gedeelteHjk aan 'droge' landbouwers die graag toegang tot het stelsel willen ten behoeve van de eigen voedselproductie. Sommigen hebben relaties met lokale handelaren die in ruil voor een stukje land de irrigatiekosten betalen. Sornmigen van deze relaties bestaan reeds jarenlang. Regels en regelgeving worden hier gezien als een van de middelen die boeren gebruiken in hun continue onderhandeling met andere boeren en voorHchters. In het Vijfde deel worden conclusies getrokken en wordt een theoretische analyse van de onderzoeksresultaten gepresenteerd. Hoofdstuk 8 plaatst sociale verschillen en culturele identiteiten in hun context van het dageHjks leven van irrigatie en regenafhankelijke of 'droge' landbouw in Nyamaropa. Hier wordt uiteengezet hoe de verschillende sociale groeperingen passen in het geheel van de sociale dynamiek van ontwikkelingsinterventies, en wat sociale wetenschappers te zeggen hebben over culturele identiteiten en sociale verschillen (hetgeen niet zoveel is tot nu toe). Dit hoofdstuk verb{\"{u}}ndt versch{\"{u}}lende theoretische thema's met de onderwerpen die naar voren zijn gekomen in voorgaande empirische hoofdstukken. Hoofdstuk 8 beziet ook de problemen die voortkomen uit extern aangestuurde interventies waarmee de irrigeerders in hun dagelijks leven als irrigeerders worden geconfronteerd. Ook worden de contradicties rond concepten als culturele identiteit en strategische verschillen in rurale ontwikkeling besproken. Het is te hopen dat studies als deze bijdragen aan een goed begrip van sociale verschillen tussen de beoogde begunstigden van ontwikkelmgsprogramrna's en dat dit zal leiden tot een meer effectieve (volgens externe criteria), maar ook meer zinvolle programma's voor diegenen die op een of andere manier door interventies worden beroerd. De Studie draagt aldus bij aan een algemeen begrip van de sociale dynamiek van rurale ontwikkeling, van landhervormingprocessen en van armoedebestrijdingsstrategie{\"{e}}n in Zimbabwe en de Zuidelijk Afrikaanse regio.},

abstract = {Considering different scenarios of future trends in climate, several authors have found that the impact that climate change will have on agriculture will most likely be negative. Most of these studies consider regions with low level of irrigation and do not control for purchased farm inputs. An important step towards understanding the evolution of agricultural production is to carefully estimate the effect that different temperatures and precipitation have on agricultural productivity considering also inputs under farmers control and the farmers profit-maximizing behavior. This research develops a county level biomass production function for an 800-mile climatic gradient from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River (41N). Our results quantify the critical effects that high temperatures have on agricultural productivity in the region, after controlling for irrigation, other managed inputs, soil characteristics, precipitation, and technological change. We find a negative and increasing (nonlinear) effect of temperatures over 30 C on crop yields; a full day of temperatures between 30 C and 35 C decreases expected yield by 1.7{\%} and a day of temperatures over 35 C decreases yields by 23.1{\%}. In addition, converting rainfed crops to irrigated crop will produce a sharp decrease in the negative impact of the higher temperature interval.

abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans and animals, but can be toxic at higher concentrations. In the mid 1980s, high Se concentrations in the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, California, caused high mortality in fish and waterfowl, initiating the National Irrigation Water Quality Program (NIWQP). The NIWQP identified the Kendrick Reclamation Project in Wyoming as one of several areas at risk for Se-related environmental problems, due to seleniferous Cody shale. Project objectives were (1) to examine relationships of Se concentration with flow, load, and suspended solids in natural streams and irrigation drains, (2) use geochemical modeling to predict Se speciation and possible sorption to minerals, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of a lab-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) inoculated with indigenous organisms from the Kendrick District at reducing Se concentrations in influents containing Se and SO42-.    We collected samples from natural streams and irrigation drains in and around the Kendrick District. Analysis was conducted using a completely randomized design with two factors; (1) inside vs. outside the district and (2) parent material (on vs. off Cody shale). Se concentrations were higher inside the district (64 and 17 $\mu$g L-1 on and off the shale, respectively) than outside the district (5 and 3 $\mu$g L-1 on and off the shale, respectively). Interaction between the two factors was significant (p=0.002), so independent-samples t-tests were used to separate the simple effects averages. Significant differences for parent material were found both inside the district (p{\textless}0.001) and outside the district (p=0.009). Se concentrations in irrigation drains were compared to natural streams. Concentrations were not significantly different between drains and streams in the irrigation off season (p=0.515), but were significantly higher in the streams during irrigation (p{\textless}0.001), indicating a dilution effect from irrigation. Streamflow was inversely correlated to Se concentration and positively correlated to Se loads.    Se6+ was the predominant form of Se present in the Kendrick surface waters, although thermodynamic data predicts Se4+ will predominate. The MINTEQA2 geochemical model was used to predict formation of solid phases that would adsorb Se4+ and explain the low concentration relative to Se6+. Although the model predicted formation of several minerals that sorb Se4+, their presence could not be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.    A lab-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) was constructed and inoculated with microorganisms collected from seleniferous surface waters of the Kendrick district to evaluate its use in remediation of Se-containing water. Four influents were used; 120 $\mu$g L-1 Se4+, 110 $\mu$g L -1 Se4+ + 11,000 mg L-1 SO4 2-, 150 $\mu$g L-1 Se6+, and 250 $\mu$g L-1 Se6+ + 10,000 mg L -1 SO42-. After a 7 day equilibration period, total Se was reduced between 89{\%} for the Se4+ + SO4 2- influent to 15{\%} for the Se4+ influent. Because apparent high evaporation from the reactor tank, (indicated by increasing SO4 2- concentrations in the last stage), may have concentrated the influents, the actual removal efficiency was likely much higher. Future work to optimize the reactor conditions may make the RBC a useful tool for bioremediation of Se-contaminated wastewater.},

abstract = {Dry-seeded rice has a potential to save water, but may entail loss in yield. A 2-year field study examined the combined effects of irrigation frequency and deep tillage on water use and productivity of rice cultivars differing in duration to maturity. Mean grain yield was greater in shorter (5.4 t ha−1) than in medium-duration (4.0 t ha−1) cultivar. Yield gain was more with deep tillage over conventional tillage (25–42{\%}) than with full irrigation over partial irrigation regime (11–16{\%}). Benefits of deep tillage were greater with partial (35–55{\%}) than with full-irrigation regime (15–35{\%}) for the two cultivars. Harvest-time soil water in top 0.30-m-depth layer was 0.2–1.0{\%} (absolute) less with deep tillage than with conventional tillage. It implies that deep tillage enhanced profile water depletion component of crop water use. These effects can be attributed to denser rooting below 0.10 m depth due to a reduction in soil penetration resistance under deep tillage that helped in better mining of subsoil water suggesting that deep tillage could be used as a water-saving intervention.},

abstract = {Amvrakikos Wetlands National Park is located in the North-West Greece.
It is an area of high environmental importance, as it is characterized
by a very rich biodiversity. Because of it's importance, the north part
of the gulf is protected by Ramsar Convention and is part of the EU
NATURA network. The adjacent plain of Arta (most of which is part of the
land part of the park), hosts intensively cultivated, irrigated
agricultural land and a number of food processing facilities and though
it constitutes a major threat for this ecosystem. As water is plentiful
and cheap, most farmers over-irrigate using water by the old open canal
scheme that covers part of the plain and from numerous drillings most of
which are illegal. The main pathways of agricultural pollutants
(fertilizers, pesticides etc) are three rivers (Louros, Aracthos and
Vovos) and three main draining canals (Salaoras, Fidokastrou and
Neochoriou). This presentation, reviews information from several
research works of the last 10 years which investigated the effects of
agricultural activity to the coastal and the inland natural and rural
landscape. Efforts that have been made (installation of measuring -
alarming stations, educational sessions for farmers, de-nitrification
programs etc) during the same period are also referred. (C) 2015 The

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to clarify the linkages between irrigation and poverty by offering an objective review of recent research on the subject. The key questions addressed herein are: (1) what is the role of irrigation development and management in poverty alleviation? (2) what are the linkages and pathways through which irrigation contributes to poverty alleviation? (3) what is the magnitude of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? and (4) what are key determinants of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? Our review focuses on topical empirical research studies in Asia. The extensive review suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation and poverty. These linkages are both direct and indirect. Direct linkages operate via localized and household- level effects, and indirect linkages operate via aggregate or subnational and national level impacts. Irrigation benefits the poor though higher production, higher yields, lower risk of crop failure, and higher and year-round farm and nonfarm employment. Irrigation enables smallholders to adopt more diversified cropping patterns, and to switch from low-value subsistence production to high- value market-oriented production. Increased production makes food available and affordable for the poor. The indirect linkages operate via regional, national, and economy-wide effects. Irrigation investments act as production and supply shifters, and have a strong positive effect on growth, benefiting the poor in the long run. Further, irrigation benefits also accrue to the poor and landless in the long run, although in the short run relative benefits to the landless and land-poor may be small, as the allocation of water often tends to be land-based. Despite that, the poor and landless benefit, in both absolute and relative terms, from irrigation investments. Recent advances in irrigation technologies, such as micro-irrigation systems, have strong anti-poverty potential. Ongoing studies in Asian countries document strong evidence that irrigation helps to alleviate both permanent and temporary poverty. Further, it helps to alleviate poverty in its worst forms, namely chronic poverty. In general, irrigation is productivity enhancing, growth promoting, and poverty reducing. Instances of negative externality effects associated with large and medium-scale irrigation systems point to management issues, and therefore call for more comprehensive response mechanisms from the planning and the political community alike. The anti-poverty impacts of irrigation can be intensified by creating conditions or enabling environments that could achieve functional inclusion of the poor. These include: (1) equitable access to land; (2) integrated water resource management; (3) access to and adequacy of good quality surface and groundwater; (4) modern production technology, (5) shift to high-value market-oriented production; and (6) opportunities for the sale of farm outputs at low transaction costs. The benefits of irrigation to the poor can be intensified by initiating broader level and targeted interventions simultaneously.},

abstract = {Vineyard replanting in Washington state can be negatively impacted by the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne hapla. Chemically focused nematode management programs do not offer long-term suppression; however, this may be achieved through the adoption of cultural approaches such as rootstocks and irrigation. Nematode-resistant rootstocks are used extensively in other regions but many have not been tested against M. hapla. Vineyards in eastern Washington are irrigated; therefore, manipulating available soil water may also impact nematode development. In 2017, two field trials were established in eastern Washington to evaluate the effects of (i) late-summer water limitation on M. hapla population development and (ii) host status of 1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, and Matador rootstocks for M. hapla. The efficacy of these cultural management approaches was evaluated under three initial M. hapla densities (0, 50, and 250 M. hapla second-stage juveniles per 250 g of soil) in both trials. Reducing irrigation to manage M. hapla infestation of grape roots was ineffective and may cause harm to the vines by inducing too much water stress. Conversely, rootstocks effectively reduced population densities of M. hapla. Overall, rootstocks show the most promise as a cultural tool to manage M. hapla during the establishment phase in Washington vineyards.},

@misc{Gulashvili2020,
abstract = {Nearly 20 years have passed since the European Community implemented the European Directives on water management. Its main directions are the achievement of good water quality and the implementation of water management principles. In Georgia, this process has been underway already for 3 years. The country's territory is divided into 6 basin areas. One of them is the Rioni River basin, whose area is 13,000 km2 with up to 700 rivers. In addition, there are reservoirs and a system of irrigation canals. In the downstream. The Rioni River flows along the wetland territory of the Colchis lowland and merges with the Black Sea near the city of Poti. Rioni is the affluent river of Georgia and taking into account this parameter, is characterized by frequent natural disasters, especially during the spring season. To this are added the tributaries, which originates from high mountains and are distinguished by fast flows. Historically fixed floods are the most ambitious than other river basins and caused the greatest losses at different times. The functioning of the agricultural lands located here and the process of stable development of settlements depends on natural disasters caused by the hydrological regime of the Rioni River, since the riverbed in the downstream and middle flow is in close contact with these objects. Given this factor, in this area there are many vulnerable districts for which prevention and mitigation of natural risks has of great importance. In the Rioni basin, in the eastern part of the Colchis Lowland, there are two cities of cultural and economic importance - Kutaisi and Samtredia, and rural settlements adjacent to their agglomerations, whose incomes are self-employment in the agricultural sphere. Therefore, reducing the vulnerability of these areas and ensuring a stable economic environment are crucial. Since the main place in the economy of the studied area is agriculture, the major challenge is the efficient use of the water resources of the Rioni River basin and the creation of a modern scheme for this use. It is also important to effectively address the issue of drinking water supply of large urban settlements and rural areas. The increased number of flood disasters in the Rioni River basin, gives us an idea, that the basin has more than enough water resources and their proper distribution would increase the effect of the economic benefits of the region and would receive a scientifically based regulated basin management system. To accomplish the goals, was made a stationary work and field trip to the study area. During the stationary work past topographic maps were analyzed to describe the earlier system of hydrotechnical constructions and management. New topographic maps and orthophotos performed by the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) of Georgia in 2007-2016 were used in conjunction with past maps to reveal the dynamics. Water users, such are the agricultural lands, were also identified on the base of cadastral information obtained from the NAPR of Georgia. The population of urban and rural settlements was determined according to the census data of the National Statistics Office of Georgia. To get acquainted with the current state of water supply/demand and its use, a field trip was made to the region. In the final phase of the research were used a computer programs "AQUATOOL" and "WEAP".},

abstract = {It is widely understood that the same policy interventions can have different outcomes depending on the social structures they are implemented in. Much less clear though is what fundamentally determines communities' social capital, or the way individuals in a society interact. This study analyzes how irrigation practices, a key feature of agricultural organization in India, affect different indicators of social capital. To this end, an informative household survey is combined with detailed historical agricultural statistics on irrigation and grain cultivation. The depth of the datasets allows for fine-grained analysis of effects of different kinds of irrigation on groups with varying degrees of involvement in the agricultural production process. I show a significant negative influence of specific types of irrigation on the prevalence of conflict and an increased likelihood for attendance of public meetings, yet it is not possible to establish a broad and consistent relationship between agricultural indicators and social capital, which contradicts previous research. Furthermore, specific groups with varying incentive structures based on their land-holding status and agricultural engagement appear to be affected by different kinds of irrigation. The results underline the need for a multidimensional analysis of both social capital and agricultural organization, as well as their interaction. I do not find evidence supporting the rice theory of culture.},

abstract = {Fuzzy SARSA learning (FSL) is a robust reinforcement learning (RL) technique that represents successful solutions in various industrial problems. Water management in irrigation canals is one of these problems where an FSL agent interacts with the canal environment to control the gates. FSL often requires a large number of interactive experiences and takes a long time in real‐life problems. To reduce the iteration and speed up the learning process, an enhanced FSL (EFSL) was developed to accelerate the process of policy learning. A MATLAB program was written, and combined with the irrigation canal conveyance system simulation (ICSS) model. To evaluate the proposed idea, the E1R1 Dez canal, located in the south‐west of Iran, was considered as a case study. Standard performance indicators were used for assessing the results based on considered water delivery scenarios, showing a shorter learning time with reasonable performance in controlling water depth changes within the canal.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}L'apprentissage flou SARSA (FSL) est une technique robuste d'apprentissage par renforcement (RL) qui repr{\'{e}}sente des solutions efficaces {\`{a}} divers probl{\`{e}}mes industriels.

abstract = {California has unsustainable use of agricultural water and energy, as well as problems of severe drought, nitrate pollution and groundwater salinity. As the leading producer and exporter of agricultural produce in the United States, 5.6 percent of California's energy is currently used for pumping groundwater. These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule, account and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil management. Growers require varying levels of decision support to integrate different irrigation strategies into farm operations. Decision support can come from the public or private sector, where there are many tradeoffs between cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm integration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear definitions, decision support and guidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy nexus benefits of different practices and combinations of practices under shifting water governance. The California Energy Commission-sponsored Energy Product Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of providing science-based evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water management for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation decision support systems in California. This project incorporates end-user perceptions into evaluations of existing decision support tools in partnership with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this article, we review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision support systems (IDSS), discuss the benefits/tradeoffs and report on their efficacy and ease of use for the most prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally, we identify research and knowledge-to-action gaps for incorporating irrigation decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for reporting water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in the state of California.},

@article{Shah2004,
abstract = {There has been renewed interest during recent times in the impact of irrigation development on rural poverty. For long, researchers asked whether irrigation development reduces the poverty of irrigators. However, the question being asked now is: does investing in irrigation - rather than in other public works - help reduce rural poverty in a region? Using Government of Gujarat's 1997 census of Below Poverty Line (BPL) households as well as the Village Amenity Survey of the same year, this paper explores the interplay between irrigation development and rural poverty in 177 predominantly rural talukas, which is an administrative unit with a population of around 100,000-150,000 people, of Gujarat state in western India. Our analysis shows that for the design of poverty-targeting programs, two variables have the highest appeal: primary education infrastructure and improved land productivity through irrigation. It also suggests that, over the long run, irrigation benefits far transcend the command areas of irrigation systems. As a result, irrigation impact studies focused at farm or command area level seriously underestimate overall livelihood impacts of irrigation development. This is because intensively irrigated areas act as magnets that attract rural poverty from their surround, especially from other dry areas. Population pressure on farm lands thus tends to get redistributed according to the carrying capacity of farm lands. Across 177 predominantly rural talukas of Gujarat, we find: a) an inverse relationship between land use intensity and land-man ratio; and b) as land productivity (output/hectare of net sown area) declines, output per rural person declines too, but far more slowly than would have been the case without the "magnet effect".},

abstract = {Irrigation is the most impacting and uncertain human intervention on the water resource. The possibility of retrieving information on irrigation practices through remote sensing technology opens unprecedented perspectives on the monitoring of anthropized basins. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of different approaches to model the contribution of the evapotranspiration in retrieving the amounts of water applied for irrigation through a soil-moisture-based (SM-based) inversion algorithm; such a contribution is conclusive especially over semi-arid regions. Three modeling approaches relying on both calculated and remotely sensed actual and potential evapotranspiration (ET and PET) data sets were implemented to represent the evapotranspiration rate within the SM-based inversion method, which allows backward estimation of irrigation through the soil water balance inversion. By combining the different evapotranspiration data sources and modeling approaches, seven experiments aimed at inverting DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture at 1 km to estimate irrigation over four heavily irrigated agricultural districts located in Spain (Aragon and Catalonia) were compared. The results highlighted that the application of the FAO56 guidelines parametrization relying on the use of optical data as proposed by the authors in a previous study remains the most reliable configuration. In fact, the implementation of a simplified approach not considering the transpiration component of the specific crop led to irrigation underestimates. Finally, it is interesting to note that the application of the method with remotely sensed ET from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) produced reliable district-aggregated irrigation estimates, thus opening the perspective of an algorithm configuration forced with remote sensing data only.},

The Irrigation Improvement Project in Egypt, started in 1994, would have a generally positive impact on the environment, as revealed by an assessment of physical and chemical properties of water of the selected improved and unimproved irrigation canal areas. Evaluation of the human health associated with irrigation improvement in the Nile Delta is the main objective of this research. The study was carried out from May 2007 to April 2008 in four selected locations along the improved and unimproved canals through a monthly water sampling program. The health condition of the farmers was assessed through a questionnaire served to 300 families. The results showed that percentage of farmers with health problems (fever, diabetes, diarrhea, vision disorders, hypertension, skin irritation and cancer) were lower in improved irrigation areas than in the unimproved ones. The values for total dissolved salts, biological oxygen demand, electrical conductivity and heavy metal content of water in the improved canals were less than in the unimproved canals, although in both cases these values were below the safe permissible limit. Water resources for multi-purpose usage must be more widely considered for positive impact in agriculture, health and environment sectors.},

abstract = {In the past three decades successive “Irrigation Improvement Projects” (IIP) have been implemented in the Nile Valley and Delta of Egypt. They have consisted in replacing scattered individual pumps by collective pumps serving distribution networks at the tertiary level, while ensuring a continuous flow in secondary canals, in lieu of the rotational system. This intervention has been praised as “a state-of-the-art project” spearheading the ‘modernization' of irrigation in Egypt. Given their ambitious objectives and the massive investment of capital planned - the 1986 policy's target was to ‘improve' one million ha by the year 2000 - these modernization efforts warrant thorough independent evaluation. This article attempts to revisit the achievements of the project after 30 years of implementation by presenting findings derived from fieldwork surveys carried out in the central part of the Delta. We document how these socio-technical innovations perform on the ground, how they change water distribution and how, in turn, they are adopted and reshaped by farmers. Understanding the contexts in which improvement projects are most beneficial, and the conditions under which such investments may be at risk, leads us to make recommendations as to how the design and implementation of these projects can be improved but also to ask whether such investment is essential for the country.},

abstract = {Irrigation is a lynchpin of rural development strategies and a key input to improving productivity and farm incomes, the key source of livelihood for the majority of the world's poor. Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions.},

abstract = {Does irrigation infrastructure lead to trust, and how does this happen? We approach these questions by testing two processes of trust formation: particularized trust built on repeated interactions of rational individuals and generalized trust based on arational habits. To identify the causal relationship between farmers' irrigation infrastructure access and trust, we conducted an incentivized trust game with beneficiaries of the irrigated land settlement program in rural Sri Lanka, where land allocation was arguably random. Two findings emerged. First, trust among community members monotonically increases with each farmer's years of access to irrigation, regardless of social relationships. Second, the nexus between irrigation access years and trust does not necessarily differ between in-group and out-group members. These findings suggest the relative significance of generalized trust formation by habits in irrigated communities, although we cannot fully rule out the possible particularized trust formation through repeated interactions. Since generalized trust is essential to facilitate market transactions, our finding is especially relevant when formulating infrastructure investment policies in developing countries. {\textcopyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The level of transfer of management responsibility precisely varies for different types of irrigation system. In India during 1990s systematic institutional and organizational changes have been undertaken to increase farmers' participation in irrigation management through formation of Water Users' Association (WUA) or Pani Panchayats under different externally assisted economic restructuring and irrigation infrastructure development programmes of World Bank, European Community, Japan Bank for International Cooperation etc. or through Union or State government initiative. Today, Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) or Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) at various levels is being implemented in different types of irrigation systems. For this programme, appropriate institutional arrangements and mechanism to bring about efficient utilization, equitable distribution and sustainable irrigation service are framed by different states of India. Further steps are being taken continuously for improvement in the strategies to achieve the goals of PIM.

abstract = {Underperformance of the irrigation systems and poor cost recovery from irrigated area in Pakistan have been a source of concern for the last few decades and since then it has been the subject of considerable external assistance and internal policy reforms. To address these problems in the management of irrigation systems, the World Bank proposed a number of institutional changes for irrigation management turnover (IMT). After thorough consideration it was decided to decentralize instead of privatizing the irrigation system management and to promote farmers' participation in the system management. Under these reforms, management at secondary canal level has recently been handed over to the farmers' organizations (FOs) of selected distributaries at a pilot scale. This study was designed to evaluate the farmer- managed distributary in southern Punjab. Initial field measurements revealed that hydraulic aspects of the irrigation service delivered by the FO management have been significantly improved and as a result a highly proportionate and equitable water distribution pattern was observed, particularly at the tail reaches of the distributary during the post-transfer scenario. Due to effective FO management farmers' interventions to increase the outlet discharge by illegal means have almost ceased. As a result of these improvements made by the FO in system management the extent of irrigated area has on average increased by 6-7{\%} even under severe drought and continued famine-like conditions prevailing in the country during recent years. Most importantly, cost recoveries have increased by an amount of 14{\%} for summer and 23{\%} for winter growing seasons respectively from the irrigated area of the distributary. Thus experience from the Hakra 4-R distributary has shown that even under undesirable natural circumstances IMT was quite effective in achieving the key targets of the institutional reforms launched at pilot scale in the country.},

abstract = {During the last quarter of the 20th century, many irrigation schemes were constructed along the bank of the Senegal River in Mauritania. About 40,000ha were developed but less than 23,000ha remain irrigated today. A program for rehabilitation is now in place to counteract deterioration and abandonment of these schemes. This paper presents an evaluation of the rehabilitation of a small, representative irrigation scheme governed by a farmers' cooperative in the village of B{\'{e}}linab{\'{e}}. Before rehabilitation, the scheme covered 37.7ha comprising 107 plots each of 0.33ha, essentially all devoted to production of rice. Water for irrigation was pumped directly from the river into two head basins and distributed through open canals. After rehabilitation, the scheme was extended to 115ha with new plots averaging 0.36ha. Water is now supplied by a single cluster of pumps and conveyed through pipes and open canals. Evaluation of performance consisted in analysis of: capacity; distribution losses; flexibility, adequacy and reliability of the system; maintenance status; farmer's perception of system performance. Field data were collected during irrigation campaigns before rehabilitation in 2004 and during 2006 and 2007 afterwards. A model of network distribution and field water balance was developed to assist evaluation. It was established that before rehabilitation the scheme could operate satisfactorily if proper maintenance were practiced. After rehabilitation, more families have access to irrigation but reliability and flexibility of water distribution have been reduced. Furthermore, pumping capacity is now insufficient to cover crop water requirements. Recommendations are provided for future rehabilitation work and maintenance of schemes generally.},

abstract = {The vicious cycle of irrigation management is characterized by lack of user participation and poor irrigation service delivery from state managed irrigation agencies leading to poor water distribution and low productivity. This precipitates inability and unwillingness by farmers to pay irrigation service fees (ISF), which deepens irrigation agency insolvency, further compromising service delivery and maintenance. Poor irrigation service delivery is often exacerbated by pervasive non-cooperative behavior by farmers to avail of water beyond an equitable and efficient distribution. To address the problem, greater farmer involvement through irrigation management transfer (IMT) has been advocated since resources users should have greater incentives and local knowledge to manage resource more effectively and have more leverage to ensure cooperative behavior. A key task in IMT is creating robust, effective local institutions (water user associations—WUAs). This dissertation evaluates World Bank IMT project outcomes in a large gravity irrigation system in the Philippines managed by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). Research activities included formal interviews with WUAs, farmer and NIA staff surveys, and discussions with NIAs, WUAs, and farmers. The dissertation details the systemic causes of poor irrigation service delivery and critiques previous Philippine experience with IMT. Research findings are mixed. System monitoring increased significantly under WUAs, which enhanced rule compliance and improved water distribution, especially for downstream farmers. ISF collections improved from greater efforts by WUAs who received 50 percent of proceeds. Farmer satisfaction and willingness to contribute resources was significantly greater when physical improvements accompanied the institutional changes and when awareness was higher. Maintenance improvements were inconclusive. The program did not appear to produce sustainable institutions because: it inadequately mobilized average farmers; WUAs did not have required capacity; clarity and accountability for responsibilities was lacking; and no real transfer of authority or governance occurred. The program had limited impact on stemming the vicious cycle of irrigation management because it could not address larger policy problems such as setting sufficient ISF rates, altering subsidy flows, redefining the role and incentives of NIA, and improving supporting agriculture service to maximize productivity.},

In this paper, we assess the potential scope for policy intervention on the construction of irrigation reservoirs and its design, focusing on the collective action aspect. We formulate a theoretical model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir. We conceptualized the reservoir as a “blue club” that increases the potential water availability in dry season, thus improving water safety for the whole society. We determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the policy measures to correct it, focusing on two different club access rules (open vs closed membership). Results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership, and minimum participation rules are required to increase the club size.},

abstract = {Despite license plates proclaiming it as the "dairy state," Wisconsin is the top cranberry producing state in the nation. Cranberry operations are unique in that they are agricultural operations that require vast quantities of water. Water discharged to lakes, wetlands, and rivers through ditches and canals during the production process can contain the phosphorus fertilizers and residues of pesticides that were applied during the growing season, which can cause serious water quality problems. Although the cranberry industry has not historically been subject to the Clean Water Act, cranberry bog discharges appear to fit squarely within the purview of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under that statute. In 2004, the Wisconsin attorney general Sled a public nuisance lawsuit against a cranberry grower, alleging that the grower discharged bog water laced with phosphorus to the lake. However, provided that cranberry bog discharges do not fall within the "irrigation return Sow" exemption from the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program may be a more cost-effective approach to addressing the water quality problems that can be caused by cranberry bog discharges.},

abstract = {In an effort to improve plant growth and to achieve high yield and/or quality, irrigation scheduling (IS) seeks to provide plants with appropriate quantities of water at appropriate times. To better understand irrigation scheduling's main processes and principles, its four most common methods of operation—(1) evapotranspiration and water balance (ET-WB), (2) soil moisture ($\Theta$) status, (3) plant water status, and (4) models—along with their pros and cons are introduced and compared. Irrigation applications, including software, programs, and associated controllers are introduced. Given that some of these methods focus on $\Theta$ or plant responses to soil moisture, the determination of target soil moisture levels, along with estimates (either calculated or measured) of current soil moisture status are key to both scheduling irrigations, and the precise replenishment of soil moisture to target levels. Accordingly, factors in the soil-crop-atmosphere system affecting soil moisture must be considered in the scheduling process. As all four types of IS methods focus on soil water content, which serves as a bridge between irrigation management and crop water requirements for growth, future scheduling methods should focus on the management of soil moisture based on an advanced understanding of its effects on crop growth either by the integration of existing IS methods or the development of new models, using intelligent algorithms. Using these approaches, more practical, accurate, and easily adaptable IS applications should be developed for real-time farming operations. Weather station networks and online data access should be enhanced to better serve these IS applications.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the most suitable irrigation frequency and quantity in cucumber grown under field conditions. The amount of water used was based on pan evaporation from a screened Class-A pan. Irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation intervals (I1: 4 and I2: 8 day), and three plant-pan coefficients (K sub(c) sub(p)1: 0.50; K sub(c) sub(p)2: 0.75 and K sub(c) sub(p)3: 1.00). Plants were first watered at the transplanting date and scheduled irrigations were initiated after 4- and 8-day intervals. Irrigation quantities applied to the treatments varied from 320 to 509mm; seasonal plant water comsumption or evapotranspiration of irrigation treatments varied from 391 to 597mm; and the cuccumber yield varied from 17.99 to 45.20tonha super(-) super(1). The highest total yield was obtained from I2K sub(c) sub(p)3 treatment. Moreover, K sub(c) sub(p)3 treatments had the highest early yield. E sub(t)/E sub(p) sub(a) sub(n) ratio according to treatments ranged from 0.29 to 1.25. Irrigation treatments had significant effects (P{\textless}0.01) on yield and there were significant positive linear relations (P{\textless}0.01) between the fruit number and irrigation water and between the plant water compsumption and the yield. In conclusion, K sub(c) sub(p)3 treatment with 8-day-irrigation interval is recommended for cucumber grown under field conditions in order to get higher cucumber yield and to save time and labor. Furthermore, the E sub(t)/E sub(p) sub(a) sub(n) equation of the best irrigation treatment (I2K sub(c) sub(p)3) of this study (E sub(t)=1.05E sub(p) sub(a) sub(n)+96.72) should, therefore, be used in the scheduling irrigation programs in similar conditions. ns.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration-based irrigation controllers, also known as ET controllers, use ET information or estimation to schedule irrigation. Previous research has shown that ET controllers could reduce irrigation as much as 42{\%} when compared to a time-based irrigation schedule. The objective of this study was to determine the capability of three brands of ET-based irrigation controllers to schedule irrigation compared to a theoretically derived soil water balance model based on the Irrigation Association Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) protocol to determine the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling. Five treatments were established, T1–T5, replicated four times for a total of twenty field plots in a completely randomized block design. The irrigation treatments were as follows: T1, Weathermatic SL1600 with SLW15 weather monitor; T2, Toro Intelli-sense; T3, ETwater Smart Controller 100; T4, a time-based treatment determined by local recommendations; and T5, a reduced time-based treatment 60{\%} of T4. All treatments utilized rain sensors set at a 6mm threshold. A daily soil water balance model was used to calculate the theoretical irrigation requirements for comparison with actual irrigation water applied. Calculated in 30-day running totals, irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency were used to quantify under- and over-irrigation, respectively. The study period, 25 May 2006 through 27 November 2007, was drier than the historical average with a total of 1326mm of rainfall compared to 1979mm for the same historical period. It was found that all treatments applied less irrigation than required for all seasons. Additionally, the ET controllers applied only half of the irrigation calculated for the theoretical requirement for each irrigation event, on average. Irrigation adequacy decreased when the ET controllers were allowed to irrigate any day of the week. All treatments had decreased scheduling efficiency averages in the rainy season with the largest decrease of 29 percentile points with a timer and rain sensor (T4) and an average decrease of 20 percentile points for the ET controllers, indicating that site specific rainfall has a significant effect on scheduling efficiency results. Rainfall did not drastically impact the average irrigation adequacy results. For this study, there were two controller program settings that impacted the results. The first setting was the crop coefficients where specific values were chosen for the location of the study when calculating the theoretical requirement whereas the controllers used default values. The second setting was the soil type that defines the soil water holding capacity of the soil. The ET controllers were able to regularly adjust to real-time weather, unlike the conventional irrigation timers. However, the incorporation of site specific rainfall measurements is extremely important to their success at managing landscape water needs and at a minimum a rain sensor should be used.},

abstract = {The High Plains aquifer is a primary source of irrigation in western Kansas. Since World War II, producers increased irrigation and the irrigated acreage with the widespread adoption of newer irrigation technologies, causing a reduction in the saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer. In an effort to conserve water and reduce further decline of the aquifer, the state of Kansas administered cost-share programs to producers who upgraded to an efficient irrigation system. But evidence suggests that the efforts to reduce water consumption have been undermined by producers, who under certain conditions have increased irrigation and irrigated acreage of high-valued and water-intensive crops. The state of Kansas is in a quandary to reduce water consumption and stabilize the saturated thickness of the aquifer while maintaining the economic viability of irrigated agriculture.   A producer is faced with the choice of crop, irrigation timing and irrigation technology at the start of the season. This research identifies the conditions for risk-efficient crop choices and estimates the effect of an irrigation technology upgrade on the aquifer. Simulation models based on data from Tribune, Kansas were executed under various scenarios, varying by crop (corn or sorghum), irrigation system (conventional center-pivot or center-pivot with drop nozzles) and well capacity (190, 285 or 570 gallons per minute). Each well capacity was associated with a pre-season soil moisture level (0.40, 0.60 or 0.80 of field capacity). Each scenario was simulated over weather data observed during the 36-year period (1971-2006).   Results indicate that producers with slower wells could maximize their net returns while conserving water by choosing less water-intensive crops like sorghum, while irrigating with a conventional center-pivot irrigation system. Producers with faster wells could maximize net returns by choosing water-intensive crops like corn and irrigate with the more efficient center-pivot with drop nozzle irrigation system. In order to reduce groundwater consumption and maintain the saturated thickness of the aquifer, water policies should internalize the interests of all stakeholders and be a combination of irrigation technology, economic factors, hydrological conditions, agronomic practices, conservation practices and local dynamics of the region.},

This paper examines the effects of the irrigation subsidy programme in Chile by reviewing 32 years of allocations and exploring the drivers and consequences of the subsidy programme with a clear market approach based on competition and a state risk-free strategy. Our analysis reveals that, despite the flexibility in targeting, the results indicate an uneven allocation to smallholders' detriment, a state inability to identify farmers' needs, market concentration and a bias towards agricultural expansion. As long as the programme remains unaltered, it will threaten agriculture and water resources' sustainability.},

abstract = {BackgroundAssessment of suitable lands for irrigation is indispensable to plan and implement different programs in a cost-effective approach for sustainable land use planning and efficient utilization of the land. Hence selecting proper land use based on land suitability evaluation will enhance the productivity per unit area and ensures the sustainable use of land resources. Therefore, the research was designed to evaluate the suitability of the soil properties of Zamra irrigation scheme for irrigation purposes.MethodFor this study about 195.16 ha of land were evaluated for irrigation suitablity. Four soil profile pits were opened in the representative site of the scheme based on slope, texture, soil color and soil depth. Soil samples were collected from the soil mapping units for analysis of texture, electrical conductivity, and calcium carbonate content, whereas slope, drainage and soil depth were directly measured at the field. The evaluation was carried out using a parametric evaluation method.ResultsThe results of the study revealed that four types of soils were identified namely, Rehodic Nitisol(eutric), Haplic Regosol (eutric) Eutric Regosol, Leptic Regosol (eutric, loamic), and Vertic Cambisol (Hypereutric). The soil texture consists of sandy loam and sandy clay loam at the surface and subsurface soil and the soil depth of study area varied from shallow to very deep. The soil of the scheme was free from salinity and the status of calcium carbonate was at a low level. The slope of the study area was ranged from flat (0–3{\%}) to slopping (8–15{\%}). Generally, 80.64 ha (41.32{\%}) of the scheme was moderately suitable whereas 71.68 ha (36.73{\%}) of the land was marginally suitable for irrigation. Due to major limiting factors of soil depth and slope about 42.84 ha of the land (21.95{\%}) were not currently suitable for irrigation.ConclusionIn the study area, the major limitations were slope and soil depth. Therefore, to increase production and productivity of the scheme, land improvement operations are suggested.},

abstract = {Depleting water resources is a widespread problem across the Kansas High Plains aquifer. The value of irrigation is accentuated due to lack of surface water and low precipitation in western Kansas. Accelerated groundwater withdrawals for irrigation caused a further decline in the saturated thickness of the aquifer. To encourage water conservation and reduce further depletion of the aquifer, federal and state cost-share programs have subsidized irrigation technology upgrades. However, this effort may have been undermined by producers who increased their water usage for irrigation with water-intensive crops. A simulation model comprised of an irrigation scheduling tool coupled with a crop yield simulator are used to predict risk-efficient crop and technology choices, which allows us to estimate the effect of an irrigation technology upgrade on the aquifer. This research characterizes producers' decisions to maintain economic viability while adapting to limited irrigation conditions. The study will identify the conditions under which technology upgrades will both save water and increase farmers' returns from irrigation. The study also estimates the threshold payments to farmers to switch to relatively less water-intensive crops that will promote water conservation on the High Plains aquifer.},

abstract = {Ensuring sustainable water supply, in particular in agriculture, requires knowledge of the local hydrologic cycle and up-to-date assessment of the water resources, determined by the new requirements of agricultural holdings water demand for irrigation and the level of irrigation infrastructure, especially in drought. The aim of the present work is to offer an informed solution for water use management in a pilot irrigation system. The study has been carried out by a balance method through a computer program for compiling a dispatching schedule, using rules for filling the reservoir with taking into account the ecological flow and data about the annual inflow into it and water consumption for irrigation in the pilot section of a selected irrigation system for the period 1990{\^{}}2019. The analysis of the results regarding the necessary volumes in the reservoir to guarantee the irrigation with characteristic exceedence probability under the existing conditions defines the respective solution. In years of drought, the volumes, the declared needs and the water supply regime should be reassessed in compliance with the priorities of water use. The study proves the need for a detailed water balance assessment for each irrigation system and mapping out adaptive measures and actions in case of drought, which is important for developing appropriate operational strategies for water management in any particular area of Bulgaria.},

abstract = {This article describes the opinions and perceptions of farmers on water management tools that conserve groundwater and on alternative sources of water for irrigation. The analysis is based on a survey of producers (N=466) across the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri. Summary statistics of practice usage across the region and for each state are presented. A Poisson count model is applied to the data to identify factors that influence the number of groundwater-conserving practices employed. The number of irrigated acres, years of farming, annual income level, perception of groundwater problems, and participation in conservation programs have statistically significant association with the number of practices employed. Years of farming experience is the only factor negatively associated with the number of practices employed, while participation in conservation programs has the largest magnitude effect on that number. These results provide evidence that sponsored conservation programs increase the number of conservation practices adopted by farmers. This insight is useful for producer collectives, policy makers, and program managers to design and target of conservation programs across the LMRB.},

abstract = {In Ethiopia, irrigation is mainly implemented in small-scale irrigation schemes, which are often characterized by low water productivity. This study reports on the efficiency and productivity of a typical small-scale irrigation scheme in the highlands of the Blue Nile, Ethiopia. Canal water flows and the volume of irrigation water applied were measured at field level. Grain and crop residue biomass and grass biomass production along the canals were also measured. To triangulate the measurements, the irrigation farm management, effects of water logging around irrigation canals, farm water distribution mechanisms, effects of night irrigation and water losses due to soil cracking created by prolonged irrigation were closely observed. The average canal water loss from the main, the secondary and the field canals was 2.58, 1.59 and 0.39 l s-1 100 m-1, representing 4.5, 4.0 and 26{\%} of the total water flow respectively. About 0.05{\%} of the loss was attributed to grass production for livestock, while the rest was lost through evaporation and canal seepage. Grass production for livestock feed had a land productivity of 6190.5 kg ha-1 and a water productivity of 0.82 kg m-3. Land productivity for straw and grain was 2048 and 770 kg ha-1, respectively, for teff, and 1864 kg ha-1 and 758 kg ha-1, respectively, for wheat. Water productivities of the crops varied from 0.2 to 1.63 kg m-3. A significant volume of water was lost from small-scale irrigation systems mainly because farmers' water application did not match crop needs. The high price incurred by pumped irrigation positively affected water management by minimizing water losses and forced farmers to use deficit irrigation. Improving water productivity of small-scale irrigation requires integrated interventions including night storage mechanisms, optimal irrigation scheduling, empowerment of farmers to maintain canals and proper irrigation schedules.},

abstract = {Lily growers adapt intensive fertigation programs to produce superior flowers, which raises substrate salinity and input cost. Soil salinity negatively impact growth and productivity and lead to several environmental problems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of K+ (applied as K2SO4 drench application) in ameliorating the negative effects of irrigation-saline water in Asiatic lily growth, physiology, and flower quality. Both lily cultivars bulbs were grown in 10 L pots filled with 3:1 peat moss: perlite. Treatments were three levels of irrigation saline water (electrical conductivity (EC), 0.5 (control), 3.0 and 6 dS m-1) and two K (applied as K2SO4) concentrations 10 and 15 mmol l-1. Irrigation with saline water significantly increased soil salinity and pH, especially in 6 dS m-1 salt level. As a result, the 6.0 dS m-1 treatment reduced stem diameter, plant height and total leaf area. In addition, gas exchange (specifically, Pn and E) in control (0.5 dS m-1) plants during the vegetative stage was significantly higher than the 6.0 dS m-1 treatment. During flowering, irrigation with 6.0 dS m-1 saline water significantly reduced flower number per stem, H* color coordinate and flower diameter. Interestingly, the response of lily flower to moderate salt stress (3 dS m-1) was similar to control (0.5 dS m-1) treatment. The 3 dS m-1 salinity treatment had similar color density coordinates (L*, C*, H*), days to flowering, and flower longevity when compared to control (0.5 dS m-1). Additionally, K2 SO4 treatment (15 mmol l-1) potentially improved lily growth (gas exchange and stem diameter) during vegetative stage. Overall, irrigation with moderate levels of salts (3 dS m-1) has no negative impact on lily growth and productivity. Furthermore, supplementary K+ applied as K2SO4 (15 mmol l-1) can alleviate the negative impact of salinity during the vegetative growth.},

abstract = {There are debates about climate-led resource scarcity and users' behavior. Common pool resources (CPRs) are of particular interest in this regard as climate change may increase existing challenges. One reason for this is that CPR users may change their behavior in ways that affect other users. This paper looks at communal irrigation as a CPR in Ethiopia, where reduced availability of water may lead to unfair water allocations. Unfairness could lead to envy, which may pose extra problems for sustainable water management. I therefore conducted a joy-of-destruction game involving 192 randomly selected household heads (players) that mimic burning of another's possession. Using a random draw, players were grouped into either the scarce water condition or abundant water condition. Within each group I randomly paired two players to play the game. This hypothetical game asks if the player in the group is willing to damage the other group's irrigation field to maximize his/her own benefit. Both descriptive and econometrics methods of analysis were employed. Surprisingly, I found that players display less envious behavior when there is water scarcity than abundance. This is an astounding result and the possible explanation could be that the participating farmers in the experiment were not fully detached from their real-life perceptions. Both variables, water condition and amount of deduction, significantly influence the players' decisions. The paper has implications on possible interventions of CPRs management, and suggests the need for further work on methodological aspects to enhance external validity in field games.},

abstract = {Limited availability of good quality water increases the need for a strategy for the use of wastewater and other low quality waters for various purposes. Irrigation with low quality water may affect crop quality, crop production and the environment. In the EU-project $\backslash$“SAFIR” (www.safir4eu.org) the $\backslash$“open modelling interface” (openMI-protocol) for model interaction is being used to integrate modelling tools handling all issues within irrigation management on a farm level, i.e. water sources, water purification, soil-plant-atmosphere processes, irrigation and fertigation strategy, risk assessment, crop quality and economy. The integrated modelling system will be used as the core of a decision support system to select water sources for irrigation and define purification requirements, based on the demands to crop quality and yield as well as economic issues. Short term and long term effects on concentrations of pollutants affecting crop quality are thoroughly analysed to propose improved practices and determine critical concentration levels. The accumulation of pollutants within a single crop cycle and the long term deterioration and degradation of the root zone of the soil will also be addressed. The integrated modelling system will be tested on data from a comprehensive field investigation programme in Denmark, Italy, Greece, Romania and China.},

abstract = {Groundwater withdrawal by desalination plants might lead to a drop of the piezometric levels of aquifers, causing negative impacts, especially in water-dependent ecosystems. Management strategies are necessary to overcome these potential problems, particularly in abandoned solar saltworks—wetlands which are particularly prone to degradation by desiccation. This paper reports the soil–vegetation relationships in one of these wetlands (Agua Amarga salt marsh, SE Spain), in which a pioneer programme of irrigation with seawater is applied to correct the environmental impacts of two desalination plants. Depth of water level and soil Eh, bulk density, moisture and salinity were determined in December 2011 and June and October 2012, in 63 plots from 12 different environments/types of vegetation. Multivariate analyses were used to identify gradients, and a model of soil–vegetation relationships was elaborated to contribute to the management of the marsh. Two different situations were identified: the periphery (drier and less saline soils) and the abandoned saline ponds (wetter and more saline soils). The three environments/types of vegetation of the periphery (Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp. stands) were separated according to the seasonal behaviour of soil salinity and moisture, regardless of the irrigation programme. Hence, modifications in the vegetation distribution should be mainly attributable to environmental factors, including possible consequences of climate change. The nine environments/types of vegetation of the abandoned saline ponds (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum growing in patches with and without the presence of seedlings, bare soils among A. macrostachyum patches, mixed stands with S. fruticosa and A. macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, flooded ponds with Ruppia maritima, Phragmites australis and a burned zone) were separated mainly according to soil moisture, water level in the soil profile, Eh and salinity. In this zone, vegetation can be used as a bioindicator to detect the consequences of the irrigation programme, which should be carefully managed if biodiversity and habitat variety have to be preserved. Our results indicate that the amount of seawater pumped is a critical issue and must be planned taking into account not only the vegetation but also the current soil properties such as bulk density (that influences water infiltration and retention) and salinity (mainly determined by the salts that remain in the soils due to the former use of the ponds as solar saltworks).},

Residents in the irrigated area experienced persistent, low-density parasite infections and higher molFOI. Addition of indoor residual spraying was effective in reducing malaria burden, but the reduction was more pronounced in the nonirrigated area than in the irrigated area.CONCLUSIONSOur findings collectively suggest that irrigation may sustain and enhance Plasmodium transmission and affects intervention effectiveness.},

abstract = {Intensification of agriculture leads to stress on the environment and subsequently can have strong societal and ecological impacts. In deserts, areas of very high sensitivity to land-use changes, these local-scale impacts are not well documented. On the arid southwestern coast of Peru, several vast irrigation programmes were developed in the 1950s on the flat detritic plateau surrounding narrow valleys to supply new farming areas. We document the long-term effects of irrigation on the erosion of arid deserts in the Vitor and Siguas valleys, south Peru, using 40 yr of satellite data. We demonstrate that irrigation initiated very large slow-moving landslides, affecting one-third of the valleys. Their kinematics present periods of quiescence and short periods of rapid activity, corresponding to landslide destabilization by their headscarp retrogression. This analysis suggests that the landslide motion continues long after their initiation by irrigations. Those landslides affect the fertile valley floors, leading to the destruction of villages and agricultural areas. We conclude that modern intensive farming can strongly impact traditional agriculture in desert areas where water management is particularly critical.},

abstract = {Current best management practice programs in Florida aim to reduce water volumes needed for producing vegetable crops. Therefore, irrigation practices that save water while maintaining the economic sustainability of those crops are desirable. Field studies were conducted to determine the effects of water management regimes on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production and assess the effects of highly retentive mulches and methyl bromide alternatives on water volumes necessary for tomato irrigation. Twelve treatments resulted from combinations of fumigant, mulches, and irrigation programs. The combinations of fumigants and mulches were as follows: a) methyl bromide + chloropicrin (67:33 v/v) at a rate of 196 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha¹ under metalized mulch; b) 1,3-dichloropropene + chloropicrin (65:35 v/v) at 150 L{\textperiodcentered}ha¹ under metalized mulch; and c) 1,3-dichloropropene + chloropicrin (65:35 v/v) at 300 L{\textperiodcentered}ha¹ under high-density polyethylene mulch. Irrigation methods were seepage (subsurface) irrigation alone at 5000 and 10,000 m³/ha per season and the same seepage irrigation volumes combined with a drip irrigation volume of 3500 m³/ha per season. Increasing seepage volume from 5000 and 10,000 m³/ha in combination with drip irrigation did not increase average soil moisture, which ranged from 9.0{\%} to 10.3{\%}. Irrigation volumes affected soil moisture when only seepage irrigation was provided, with values increasing from 9.4{\%} to 11.9{\%} when water volumes increased from 5000 to 10,000 m³/ha, respectively. Only irrigation affected total marketable fruit weight. Adding drip irrigation to seepage-treated plots positively affected fruit weight, increasing yields from 36.5 Mg{\textperiodcentered}ha¹ in plots with only seepage to 39.5 Mg{\textperiodcentered}ha¹. Increasing seepage irrigation from 5000 to 10,000 m³/ha in plots under drip irrigation improved yield from 34.5 to 44.5 Mg{\textperiodcentered}ha¹. However, increasing seepage volumes in plots without drip irrigation did not affect tomato total marketable yields.},

@article{Racchetti2019a,
abstract = {In the Po plain, northern Italy, rivers within agricultural basins display steep summer increases in nitrate (NO3−) concentrations. Flood irrigation in overfertilized, permeable soils may drive such diffuse pollution, facilitating interactions between NO3−-rich groundwater and surface waters. We discuss multiple, indirect evidence of this mechanism in the Adda, Oglio, and Mincio rivers. These rivers drain agricultural soils with elevated nitrogen (N) surpluses, averaging 139, 193, and 136 kg ha−1 in the Adda, Oglio, and Mincio watersheds, respectively. The three rivers cross a transitional area between highly permeable and impermeable soils, where summer NO3− concentrations may increase by one order of magnitude over short distances (8–20 km). Upstream of this transitional area, a major fraction of the river flow is diverted for flood irrigation, a traditional and widespread irrigation technique for permeable soils. We speculate that diverted water solubilizes soil N excess, recharges the aquifer, and transfers soil N surplus into groundwater, resulting in NO3− pollution. Groundwater–river interactions were estimated experimentally, via water and NO3− budgets in 0.3 to 1 m3 s−1 km−1 and in 1500 to 5400 kg NO3−–N day−1. The data suggest a pronounced east–west gradient of groundwater to river diffuse water inputs among the three adjacent basins, reflecting the soil permeability and the width of the river–groundwater interaction zone. Given the large stock of NO3− in groundwater, management interventions performed at the basin scale and aimed at decreasing N excess will not produce an immediate decrease in river NO3− pollution.},

abstract = {Interventions aimed at increasing water availability for livelihood and domestic activities have great potential to improve various determinants of undernutrition, such as the quantity and diversity of foods consumed within the household, income generation, and women's empowerment. However, current evidence on the topic is diluted across many different publications. This paper aims to connect the dots and review the literature available on the linkages between irrigation and food security, improved nutrition, and health. We conclude that the evidence remains insufficient to draw broad conclusions due to the low number of rigorous studies that can be used to assess the linkages. Based on the limited evidence, six factors that should be taken into account in irrigation development to address nutrition and gender gapswith a focus on Africa south of the Sahara are identified: ( 1) food security and nutrition gains should be stated goals of irrigation programs; (2) training programs and awareness campaigns should accompany irrigation interventions to promote nutrient-dense food production and consumption as well as minimization of health risks; (3) multiple uses of irrigation water should be recognized in order to improve access to water supply and sanitation and livestock and aquatic production; (4) women's empowerment and women's participation in irrigation programs should be promoted; (5) homestead food production should be encouraged; and (6) policy synergies between different sectors (agriculture, nutrition, health, water supply and sanitation, education) should be sought.},

abstract = {In the context of increased competition for water, growing more rice with less water will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. This paper examines water savings and issues of scale in water productivity. The main objective is to understand if and how field-scale interventions scale up to subbasin-scale water savings in the Zhanghe Irrigation District (ZID) in Hubei Province, central China. Our results confirmed that on-farm water-saving practices result in higher water productivity per unit of irrigation water at the field scale due to lower irrigation water input. However, the question is, if these field-scale practices have led to "real" water savings; savings which can be transferred to other agricultural and non-agricultural uses without lowering existing production levels. To investigate this question, we examined water use and productivity at four different scales: field scale, meso scale, main canal command scale, and subbasin scale using the water accounting methodology. The study clearly demonstrates the high dependence on the scale of water use and productivity parameters. Depleted fraction and water productivity per unit of gross inflow and irrigation water varied dramatically across scale. Thus, it is not possible to conclude from field-scale observations that basin level water savings will or will not take place. The major reasons for these scale effects are the lateral flow of water across boundaries, differing land use patterns across scales, and changing water management patterns across scales. In the ZID, going from field and meso scale to even larger scales, water productivity per unit of irrigation increases to even higher levels than at the field scale. Here it becomes clear that the ZID, with its possibilities of reuse of drainage return flows and capturing rainfall and runoff in all the reservoirs within the system, is very effective in capturing and using water productively. Factors that influence water productivity and depleted fraction are on-farm water savings as well as the reuse of drainage water, effective capturing and utilization of rain, and canal water management. The scope for additional real water savings in the Zhanghe Irrigation District is limited. Only 13{\%} of the combined rainfall and Zhanghe reservoir irrigation water releases flow out of the basin. A further reduction in drainage surface outflow from the ZID may have negative downstream effects on other water uses, including environmental uses. The main lessons learned are that (1) employing a combination of factors--on-farm practices, reuse, and canal operations--can be an effective means of conserving water resources within irrigation systems, (2) the scope for savings must be considered by an analysis at larger scales (i.e. irrigation system or basin scale), and may be less than thought because of the interactions of these factors. The results clearly indicate that scale effects are important for understanding and planning for water savings and water productivity.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a field study undertaken in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, to understand the experience and impact of an ongoing programme of transitioning from karez (an ancient mode of tapping groundwater) to tubewell irrigation on social equity, livelihoods, community cohesion and environmental quality. The article explores how changes in water management techniques and technologies are influenced by and, in turn, impact social power relations at various scales. Analyses of the field study results and policy context of groundwater management in Balochistan reveals that the transition from karez to tubewell irrigation was neither inevitable nor necessarily more advantageous but, rather, the outcome of deliberate policy choices by the government. The diffusion of tubewells is putting traditional communal modes of power in communities under stress and, in places, replacing them with the power of large farmers. At the policy level, the differential power of the discourse of modernization, coupled with the compensatory power of large farmers, is facilitating the rapid diffusion of tubewells in Balochistan. The transition from karez to tubewell irrigation also is having negative consequences for social equity and environmental quality. The article concludes by proposing specific policy initiatives that may help save and rehabilitate the rapidly dwindling karez irrigation in Balochistan.

abstract = {In the pursuit of information to support policies and actions to alleviate hunger and poverty through irrigation and drainage, this paper attempts to provide correlations between water scarcity, communities and poverty. Many reviews have found strong direct and indirect relationships between irrigation and poverty. One of the main goals of the international community is to eliminate hunger and poverty and in this perspective, through the Millennium Development Goals, much progress has been achieved and evidence obtained. Sustainable Development Goals and various other United Nations initiatives intend to move forward this agenda by making it a part of broader development frameworks. In this paper, the important elements of irrigation and drainage that affect the alleviation of hunger and poverty are discussed. These elements are grouped into governance, rights-based developments, water rights and pricing, management, efficiency improvement, and the role of technology. Both the potential and the need for innovative technology and solutions in irrigation are underlined, which can be used to cater for the challenges in different subsectors. The main focus of these solutions is on maximizing productivity and efficiency, reducing water losses, achieving sustainable intensification and managing demands on water resources and the associated trade-offs.

abstract = {In the state of Louisiana surface irrigation is widely used due to the low start-up cost, typically high rainfall, and soil conditions. Irrigation scheduling is an important practice to achieve water use efficiency in agriculture. The objectives of this study were to compare three different methods to determine crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for soybeans in addition to, evaluate a computer based irrigation scheduling program using real scale fields. Weather variables, soil moisture and irrigation water use collected during the summer months of 2005 and 2006 at a production agriculture farm in northeast Louisiana were studied. The ETc estimates obtained using atmometers (ETgage); a weather station approach; an evapotranspiration algorithm from the computer based Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS). Three weeks of continuous ETc values showed that the atmometer and the weather station methods estimated similar values. The AIS method estimated lower values than the other two methods. The higher estimates by the weather station compared to the AIS are related to higher ETo values throughout the analyzed period. Similar estimation by the atmometer and the weather station methods suggest that these approaches were more suitable than the AIS method for estimating ETc at Angelina Plantation. The AIS proved to be a good scheduling tool that accurately predicts the crop's irrigation needs. However, the results obtained at Angelina Plantation suggest that the farmer or irrigator programs the irrigation events modified by on-farm requirements. The AIS monitored the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD). Higher MAD values at the end of the crop cycle reduced the number of irrigations per field but increased the water use. Non-standard procedures implemented in leveled basins suggested a negative impact in the field drainage and made the irrigation process more labor intensive. Extra care is necessary to avoid waterlogging with level basins.},

This led successive governments to introduce policies to systematically reduce water available for irrigated agriculture. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was developed by the Commonwealth government and is designed to secure water savings from irrigators and to direct those water savings to the stressed natural environment. This paper focuses on the impact of these changes on irrigation dairy families and their communities in northern Victoria. Using a model designed to test the limits to adaptation, we draw out the constraints, limits and barriers to adaptation for dairy families and their communities coping with reduced water access. This model highlights the types of socially just and fair interventions necessary to assist adaptation and focuses attention on thresholds and traps that may prevent adaptation. The model is relevant to other areas where climate changes and environmental disasters are shaping inevitable change.},

abstract = {Groundwater abstraction is among the main anthropogenic causes of wetland desiccation worldwide, and corrective measures must be taken to avoid degradation of this valuable ecosystems. A case study is the Agua Amarga salt marsh (≈180 ha) (SE Spain). Agua Amarga includes a solar saltwork pond network in operation between 1925 and 1975, when it was abandoned, and the ponds were colonized by salt marsh vegetation. In 2008 two desalination plants were operating in the marsh vicinity, which were supplied with groundwater. To mitigate the possible negative impact on the salt marsh ecosystem due to groundwater drawdown, in 2009 a sea water irrigation program was implemented. This paper summarizes the results of a ten-year monitoring program (2010–2020) to evaluate the effects of the irrigation program on groundwater levels and quality, soil salinity and moisture, and vegetation cover. During this period, average groundwater level was 2.5 m below the surface and around 1 m deep near the irrigated ponds. Groundwater salinity was not affected outside the saltmarsh, but inside, where the saltworks caused values to rise above 300 mS/cm, it decreased more than 150 mS/cm in some 20 m deep piezometers. Between 2012 and 2020, vegetation cover increased between ≈10 and ≈25 {\%}, with halophyte species such as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Sarcocornia fruticosa being the most favoured. In areas with prolonged flooding, Ruppia maritima, a plant species that lives submerged in saline water, was found. In the irrigated areas, soil electrical conductivity (1:5 soil:water extracts) decreased from ≈7-14 mS cm-1 to ≈2-6 mS cm-1. We present an example of sustainable actions in a coastal wetland, where the exploitation of water resources in semiarid areas is combined with promoting natural habitats.},

abstract = {Objectives: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) results in significant morbidity and healthcare expenditure. The safety and effectiveness of nasal irrigation for the treatment of pediatric CRS has been demonstrated, but its long-term outcomes are unknown. This study's goals were to assess the effectiveness of nasal irrigation after first-time use for pediatric CRS and to determine the short- and long-term outcomes of treating nasal symptoms with irrigation.   Methods: This was a two-part study. First, we performed a retrospective cohort study on pediatric CRS patients who were treated by a single pediatric otolaryngologist between July 2003 and January 2012 and were prescribed a 6-week course of nasal irrigation. Demographics, presenting symptoms, Lund-Mackay scores, and treatment outcomes were summarized. Second, we surveyed parents from 1 to 9 years later to assess each patient's symptom recurrence, parent-initiated use of nasal irrigation for recurrent symptoms, and any subsequent surgical interventions.   Results: One hundred four patients were reviewed. The mean age was 8.0 years, and 65.4{\%} were male. Presenting symptoms included congestion (95.2{\%}), cough (79.8{\%}), and rhinorrhea (60.6{\%}). Comorbid conditions include asthma (57.3{\%}) and positive allergy test (50.0{\%}). After the initial 6 weeks of irrigation, 57.7{\%} of patients reported complete resolution of symptoms, and 10.6{\%} patients underwent FESS. Reductions in Lund-Mackay scores were 4.14 and 4.38 on the left and right sides, respectively (p{\textless}0.001). Fifty-four parents completed the follow-up survey with a median length of follow-up of 48 months (range 20-113). Of those surveyed, 53.7{\%} reported using irrigation again in the last 12 months (median 1, IQR 0-3), and an additional 3 patients underwent FESS. There were no significant differences in age, Lund-MacKay score changes, and symptom resolution proportions between those who completed the survey versus not.   Conclusion: Nasal irrigation may well be effective as a first line treatment for pediatric CRS as well as for recurring symptoms. Once nasal irrigation is used as a treatment modality for pediatric CRS, parents and caretakers are likely to utilize it again for recurrent symptoms. Patients with symptoms of CRS, even when refractory to other medical therapies, should utilize nasal irrigation before consideration for FESS.},

The children and their caregivers were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire before TAI and at 3 months and 3 years after initiation of the program.Results:Successful treatment outcome was achieved in 38 (86.4{\%}) children after a mean follow-up duration of 33 months (range, 30-36). The mean number of fecal incontinence episodes per week, the number of diaper changes and the total time for bowel care per day before the program decreased at the latest follow-up examination from 7.3 to 0.4 (P{\textless}0.001), 1.6 to 0.2 (P{\textless}0.001) and 29.2 to 19.4 min (P=0.038), respectively. These results remained constant from short-term follow-up at 3 months to 3 years. Caregivers and children could go out more often (P=0.002), and the emotional impact of bowel care on caregivers decreased (P{\textless}0.001). The reported mean overall satisfaction with TAI was 8/10. The common adverse effect during TAI was abdominal discomfort (60.5{\%}).Conclusion:We observed a sustained significant improvement in defecation symptoms and quality of life for 3 years in spina bifida children who underwent continuous TAI.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to evaluate the long‐term water conservation potential of two smart irrigation controllers when implemented in single‐family homes with excess irrigation. Treatments were established in Orange County, Florida, across two types of soils and included homes monitored only (MO), homes that received an evapotranspiration (ET) controller or a soil moisture sensor (SMS) controller, and homes that received an ET or SMS plus an onsite specific programing and tutorial given to the homeowner (ETPgm or SMSPgm, respectively). All treatments resulted in significant water savings compared with the MO group, without negatively affecting the turf quality. Average irrigation reductions in sandy and flatwoods soils for ET were 21{\%} and 17{\%} and 26{\%} and 31{\%}, respectively, in the ETPgm group. The SMS group reduced irrigation by 18{\%} and 42{\%} in flatwoods and sandy soils, respectively, while the SMSPgm treatment applied 41{\%} and 35{\%} less water, respectively.

abstract = {BackgroundConstipation is common in adults and up to 20{\%} of the population report this symptom. Chronic constipation (CC), usually defined as more than 6 months of symptoms, is less common but results in 0.5 million UK GP consultations per annum. The effect of symptoms on measured quality of life (QOL) is significant, and CC consumes significant health care resources. In the UK, it is estimated that 10{\%} of district nursing time is spent on constipation. Trans-anal irrigation therapy has become a widely used treatment despite a lack of robust efficacy data to support its use. The long-term outcome of treatment is also unclear. A randomised comparison of two different methods of irrigation (high- and low-volume) will provide valuable evidence of superiority of one system over the other, as well as providing efficacy data for the treatment as a whole.MethodsParticipants will be recruited based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Following informed consent, they will be randomised to either high-volume (HV) or low-volume (LV) irrigation and undergo standardised radiological and physiological investigations. Following training, they will commence home irrigation with the allocated device. Data will be collected at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months according to a standardised outcomes framework. The primary outcome is PAC-QOL, measured at 3 months. The study is powered to detect a 10{\%} difference in outcome between systems at 3 months; this means that 300 patients will need to be recruited.DiscussionThis study will be the first randomised comparison of two different methods of trans-anal irrigation. It will also be the largest prospective study of CC patients treated with irrigation. It will provide evidence for the effectiveness of irrigation in the treatment of CC, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the two methods. This will enable more cost-effective and evidence-based use of irrigation. Also, the results will be combined with the other studies in the CapaCiTY programme to generate an evidence-based treatment algorithm for CC in adults.Trial registrationISRCTN, identifier: ISRCTN11093872.

Thus, field experiments have been carried out in a split–plot design at the Agricultural Research Station, Faculty of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University. The experiments included 20 treatments, four wheat genotypes, (Yecora Rojo, West bread, KSU 102 and KSU 105) and five irrigation schedules (50, 100, 150, 200 mm) of cumulative pan evaporation CPE, as compared to traditional irrigation methods used by many farmers (weekly irrigation). The total amount of water supplied over the growing season was calculated. The data obtained clearly indicated that a gradual decrease in most of the yield and yield component characters were in line with decreasing irrigation schedules. The results also showed that no significant differences were found between irrigation schedules at 50 mm of CPE and weekly irrigation in most of the studied characters, except on biological yield, which was similar to traditional irrigation. In addition, significant differences among wheat genotypes were observed in all traits. The KSU 105 genotype ranked in the first position and surpassed the other tested genotypes. The interaction between irrigation schedules and genotypes was also significant for grain yield.

abstract = {The influence of gender in participatory irrigation management reforms has been the subject of significant research in the past. Whilst there is some understanding of what hinders women and marginalized groups from participating in irrigation management, there is limited understanding of how male and female farmers vary in their perceptions on the effectiveness of participation in irrigation affairs. There is also limited understanding around the interaction on gender and the overall success of participatory irrigation management programs. Based on the information obtained from 128 households surveyed through separate male and female questionnaires in Pakistan in 2018 (Sindh and Punjab provinces), we studied the country's experience in engaging gender into its participatory irrigation management program. We found there was a significant difference in participatory irrigation management perceptions across both gender and locational jurisdiction. Overall, women generally perceive the performance and impact of farmer organizations to be significantly less effective than men. Our study emphasizes the importance of putting findings in a historical context to inform the theory, policy, and practice of mainstreaming gender into irrigation management.},

abstract = {Little is known about the comparison of management practices on malt barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) yield and quality in irrigated and non-irrigated cropping systems. We evaluated the effects of irrigation, tillage, cropping system, and N fertilization on malt barley yield and quality in a sandy loam soil from 2005 to 2011 in croplands converted from Conservation Reserve Program in western North Dakota. Treatments were two irrigation practices (irrigated vs. non-irrigated) and five cropping systems (conventional till malt barley with nitrogen fertilizer [CTBN], conventional till malt barley without nitrogen fertilizer [CTBO], no-till malt barley–pea [Pisum sativum L.] with nitrogen fertilizer [NTB–P], no-till malt barley with nitrogen fertilizer [NTBN], and no-till malt barley without nitrogen fertilizer [NTBO]). Malt barley biomass and grain yields were greater with NTB–P, CTBN, and NTBN than CTBO and NTBO in the irrigated and non-irrigated practices. Compared with CTBO and NTBO, grain protein concentration was greater with CTBN in the irrigated practice and greater with NTB-P in the non-irrigated practice. Grain plumpness was greater with CTBO than CTBN in the irrigated practice and greater with CTBN than NTB–P in the non-irrigated practice. Plant stand and test weight were greater with CTBO than CTBN in the irrigated practice and harvest index greater with NTBO than other treatments in the non-irrigated practice. Because of similar or superior yield and quality, NTB–P may be used to sustain malt barley yield and quality compared with the traditional CTBN in the irrigated condition and during years with adequate precipitation in the non-irrigated condition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of open fractures demands rapid intervention consisting of intravenous antibiotics, aggressive debridement, fracture immobilization, and soft tissue management including additional debridements and soft tissue coverage. Despite this approach, infection, particularly osteomyelitis, after open fracture continues to be a source of significant morbidity. Recent literature has provided several studies that performed clinical trials in superficial wounds. These investigations compared sterile solutions with tap water for wound decontamination. The results suggest that tap water washouts are cost-effective for these specifie wounds. MATERIAL: An established protocol using sterile porcine hind limb tibias, as reported by Bhandari et al., was applied with modification. There were then 15 specimens and 5 controls (no irrigation) for each condition. The conditions were potable water and sterile water. A representative bacterium of gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, or gram-negative, Escherichia coli, acted as the contaminant. Sectioned, sterile porcine hind limb tibias were inoculated with 1 mL of a known concentration (1x 10 super(10)) of bacterium and incubated. Each specimen was then irrigated, with bulb irrigation at a standardized distance of 15 cm, with 500 mL of irrigation. The specimen, along with 0.5 mL of wash (irrigant collected after it was placed over the specimen), was placed in 5 mL of Brain Heart Infusion broth. All specimens were incubated in this broth at 37 degree C for 2 hours. At 2 hours, a 100- mu L supernatant was plated on blood agar plates and incubated for 24 hours. Colony counts for each specimen and controls were then performed. RESULTS: The number of colony forming units (CFUs) for each type of bacterium was different. The average CFUs from bone samples contaminated with E. coli was 5.18 x 10 super(8) after irrigation with sterile water and 6.24 x 10 super(8) after irrigation with tap water. The average CFUs from bone samples contaminated with S. aureus was 18 x 10 super(6) after irrigation with sterile water and 12 x 10 super(6) after irrigation with tap water. The average CFUs from the irrigation samples from E. coli contamination treated with sterile water was 1.3 x 10 super(6) and the CFUs from E. coli contamination treated with tap water was 2.2 x 10 super(6). The average CFUs from the irrigation samples from S. aureus contamination treated with sterile water was 1.57 x 10 super(6) and the CFUs from S. aureus contamination treated with tap water was 1.56 x 10 super(6). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between the CFUs for the sterile and potable water (p = 0.201) for each bacterium (p = 0.871).},

abstract = {Human interventions often lead to unsustainable river systems. There is always a trade-off between level of socio-economic gains from consumptive use in the river system and the need to maintain the natural seasonality of river flows supporting the ecosystem function. In the case of the Murrumbidgee River, Australia, irrigation demand is concentrated in the summer season while natural inflows to the river occur during the winter season. The summer-dominated irrigation water demand has created environmental and supply problems by altering the natural flow regime. This paper presents a hydrologic assessment of a range of irrigation demand management options for improving the natural seasonality of the river flow. Among the possible alternatives, change of cropping pattern by achieving a better mix of summer and winter crops is recommended as the most feasible alternative, which can also save up to 211 million m3 of water yearly. This water can then be released during the winter time to augment the environmental flows of the river. Other irrigation demand management options explored in this paper include aquifer storage and recovery, on-farm and off-farm water savings and construction of intermediate surface water storages.},

abstract = {Agriculture development has been the main strategy for the socioeconomic development in the country since time immemorial, even though its contribution to GDP has been declining recently. Successive governments of Sri Lanka since independence have invested heavily in the irrigated agriculture sector to address the food security concerns of the country. The continuous investment in irrigation was required to address problems such as spatial and temporal variations in monsoonal rainfall in the country, which has a serious negative impact on food production and livelihoods of people. The need for pursuing irrigation development and management has become more important in the country in the face of rapid population growth and increasing food prices in the world market. In this context, managing irrigation schemes for productivity increase is becoming increasingly important and different irrigation management models have also emerged through attempts made in this direction by countries including Sri Lanka, where irrigation plays a leading role in food production and nation development. Farmers' active involvement in irrigation management, especially operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) and decision-making as well, has been identified as a key requirement to attain productivity goals and the sustainability of irrigation systems. This paper aims at reviewing participatory irrigation management approaches adopted in medium and major irrigation systems in Sri Lanka with a view to identifying their past and present trends and future directions. The review will contribute to an improved understanding by policymakers, managers of irrigation schemes and farmers of the role of participatory irrigation management, its past and present including institutional structures, responsibilities and performance and the directions it should take to meet future challenges as a dynamic institutional mechanism. As all the medium and major irrigation schemes in the country are jointly managed by farmers and government agencies, the inferences drawn from the review would be important for the agencies and farmers alike to introduce necessary changes in their programs to address future needs and requirements.},

abstract = {Limited supply of clean water in urbanizing watersheds creates challenges for safely sustaining irrigated agriculture and global food security. On-farm interventions, such as riverbank filtration (RBF), are used in developing countries to treat irrigation water from rivers with extensive fecal contamination. Using a Bayesian approach incorporating ethnographic data and pathogen measurements, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) methods were employed to assess the impact of RBF on consumer health burdens for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus infections resulting from indirect wastewater reuse, with lettuce irrigation in Bolivia as a model system. Concentrations of the microbial source tracking markers pepper mild mottle virus and HF183 Bacteroides were respectively 2.9 and 5.5 log1† units lower in RBF-treated water than in the river water. Consumption of lettuce irrigated with river water caused an estimated median health burden that represents 37{\%} of Bolivia's overall diarrheal disease burden, but RBF resulted in an estimated health burden that is only 1.1{\%} of this overall diarrheal disease burden. Variability and uncertainty associated with environmental and cultural factors affecting exposure correlated more with QMRA-predicted health outcomes than factors related to disease vulnerability. Policies governing simple on-farm interventions like RBF can be intermediary solutions for communities in urbanizing watersheds that currently lack wastewater treatment.},

abstract = {Protecting flood prone locations through floodwater recharge of the depleted aquifers and using it for protecting dry season irrigated agriculture is the rationale for a form of intervention termed as ‘underground transfer of floods for irrigation' (UTFI). This helps reduce the intensity of seasonal floods by tapping and storing excess floodwater in aquifers for productive agricultural use. This paper presents a case study of managing the recharge interventions in the context of the Ramganga basin, India. Using a case study approach, this study determines the socio-economic and institutional context of the study area, proposes three potential routes to institutionalize UTFI, and provides insights for scaling up the interventions in the Ganges and other river basins that face seasonal floods and dry season water shortages.Managing the interventions involves community participation in regular operations and maintenance tasks. Given the limited scale of the pilot UTFI intervention implemented to date, and the socio-economic and institutional context of the case study region, the benefits are not conspicuous, though the piloting helped in identifying potential ways forward for the long-term management of the pilot site, and for scaling up the interventions. Initially pilot site management was handled by the project team working closely with the community leaders and villagers. As the intervention was demonstrated to perform effectively, management was handed over to the district authorities after providing appropriate training to the government personnel to manage the system and liaise with the local community to ensure the site is operated and managed appropriately. The district administration is willing to support UTFI by pooling money from different sources and routing them through the sub-district administration. While this is working in the short term, the paper outlines a programmatic longer term approach for wider replication.},

abstract = {Precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are two important variables in hydrologic analyses, agricultural crop production, determining actual crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirements, and irrigation management. Both variables vary in space and time, and the weather networks that measure or quantify and report both variables are too sparse for practical applications by water resources planners, managers, and irrigators. Long-term (1986-2009) average annual (January to December), seasonal (growing season, May to September), and monthly (May, June, July, August, and September) precipitation and Penman-Monteith-estimated alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ET(ref)) were spatially interpolated and mapped for all 93 counties in Nebraska using the spline interpolation technique in ArcGIS. Precipitation gradually increased from the western part and southwest corner (zone 1) to the eastern part (zone 4) of the state. Long-term average county annual precipitation ranged from 325 to 923 mm, with a statewide mean of 581 mm. The long-term average seasonal precipitation showed a similar trend as the annual precipitation and ranged from 215 to 601 mm, with a statewide average of 380 mm. Based on the annual average precipitation data, there was an approximately 30 mm decrease in precipitation for every 40 km from east to west. Seasonal and annual precipitation were inversely proportional to elevation with high coefficients of determination (R(2)=0.94 for annual and R(2)=0.88 for seasonal). Annual precipitation decreased between 18 and 131 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation. Seasonal precipitation decreased between 11 and 72 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation. The long-term statewide average annual ET(ref) was 1,400 mm, with significant differences across the state: 1,662 mm (zone 1), 1,542 mm (zone 2), 1,350 mm (zone 3), and 1,285 mm (zone 4). The statewide long-term average seasonal ET(ref) was 883 mm, with a maximum of 1,087 mm and minimum of 684 mm. The maximum monthly ET(ref) of 268 mm was observed in July, and the minimum value of 12 mm was observed in December. The annual ET(ref) increased by 47 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation, and the seasonal ET(ref) increased by 29 mm for every 100 m increase in elevation. Spatially interpolated maps of precipitation and ET(ref) can provide important background information and physical interpretation of precipitation and ET(ref) for climate change studies in the region, which can lead to the ability to take proactive steps to balance water supply and demand through various available methods, such as changing cropping patterns to implement cropping systems with lower water demand, reduced tillage practices to minimize unbeneficial water use (soil evaporation), implementing newer drought-tolerant crop hybrids and cultivars, implementing deficit irrigation strategies, and initiating and deploying more aggressive and effective irrigation management programs.},

abstract = {Summary This thesis documents my attempt to study masculinities among irrigation engineers and water professionals in Nepal. It is based on the recognition that more than two decades of mainstreaming gender in development research and policy have failed to come to grips with the masculine subject. In this thesis, it is hypothesized that there is something intrinsically masculine about the irrigation and water management profession, both in the West and in Nepal. This hypothesis is based on personal experience, being a male researcher myself and being trained as an irrigation professional in the Netherlands, and having travelled to India and Nepal to meet irrigation engineers and water professionals in an intercultural context. The hypothesis is also based on academic questioning of masculinities in irrigation. The aim of the thesis is to scrutinize a taken-for-granted association of men with organisational power, authority and expertise in irrigation. To facilitate investigations, two domains in the world of irrigation are conceptualized: the domain of the irrigation professional and the domain of irrigation expert knowledge. For each of these domains, a set of research questions has been formulated. First, how does one become an irrigation engineer in Nepal, employed in the Department of Irrigation, and what masculinities might be involved in becoming one; and second, how might masculinities be implicated in irrigation knowledge and water expert thinking. To answer the first question, this thesis analyses the institutions of engineering education, professional associations and regulatory bodies, and the Department of Irrigation. To answer the second question, this thesis analyses the use and presentation of irrigation data in policy making and it examines histories of irrigation expert thinking in Nepal. The conceptual backbone of the thesis is to see professional performance in irrigation as cultural performance, drawing inspiration from the work of Victor Turner in particular. In Chapter 1, I explain that he metaphor of performance can be read as technical performance and cultural performance, and is conceived in this thesis as two sides of the same coin, mutually constituting professional performance. In the process of research, I have come to see the concept of cultural performance as particularly apt for this thesis. It has enabled me to conceptualize linkages between the gender of engineers, professional cultures in irrigation and technical representations in irrigation knowledge, without having to exclude myself from the writing process. The latter is important in research on masculinities because identifications of masculinities and femininities are unavoidably interpretative, situated and partial. Chapter 2 presents historical contexts of irrigation development in Nepal, highlighting the main state interventions in the sector and some of the changes in professional practice in irrigation. It also presents a background on the education system and the civil service in Nepal from the 1950s onwards, highlighting gendered aspects of these institutions and revealing that they have functioned as closed institutions of the high-class, upper-caste elite in Nepal. It also documents a history of women professionals in rural development in Nepal from the 1950s onwards, in an attempt to understand why there are so few female irrigation engineers in the Department of Irrigation. In this account, I briefly re-visit the introduction of ‘social organisers' in irrigation in the early 1990s in an attempt to figure out why social organiser positions were not taken up by women professionals as community specialists. The analysis reveals that the position of women professionals, from the 1950s onwards, has been defined in terms of their ‘feminine capacity' to deal with ‘women's issues', marked by their non-involvement in broader issues of development. Chapter 3 presents feminist histories of the main institutions that constitute the roadway for becoming an irrigation engineer in Nepal. The first institution is engineering education, focussing on Nepal but also mentioning the places abroad (mainly in India) where Nepalese men (and some women) have gone for engineering education. The focus is mainly on diploma (overseer) and bachelor (engineer) level education in the disciplines of civil – and agricultural engineering. For these disciplines, I have collected gender and caste segregated enrolment data of students at engineering colleges in Nepal (going back to the 1980s). A second set of institutions are the regulatory organisations for the engineering profession in Nepal and the professional associations that exist in relation to the field of engineering, water, agriculture and irrigation. It presents an analysis of about 40 professional associations and also discusses some of the incipient networks of women professionals in natural resources management. The third institution is the Department of Irrigation, describing its history from 1952 onwards (year of establishment) and presenting an analysis on who is employed in the organisation. The analysis of the institutions reveals that they mainly have been the world of men. Chapter 4 focusses on the informal milieu in the Department of Irrigation to understand how one becomes a ‘real' irrigation engineer. The analysis is based on the assumption that getting an engineering degree, and becoming a member of an engineering association and securing employment in the civil service of the Department of Irrigation, does not automatically make a person a ‘real' irrigation engineer. It is hypothesized that junior engineers need to participate in the informal milieu of the institutions, develop agency and acquire the desire, skills and perceptions that ‘fit' a normative and gender authentic performance of a ‘real' irrigation engineer. The development of agency and desire is conceptualized to occur through two distinct yet interrelated processes, which I call ‘self-normalization' and ‘transitional performance'. The analysis reveals that the informal milieu of the Department of Irrigation is infiltrated with social stereotypes and cultural norms that prevail in (elite) society in Nepal, causing barriers, particularly for women, to perform as ‘real' irrigation engineers. The analysis also identifies two periods in the lives of engineers that can be conceived as rites of passage for becoming an irrigation engineer: ‘the college' and ‘the field'. It is suggested that participation in these rites of passage is a pre-requisite to become a ‘real' irrigation engineer. Chapter 5 discusses the performance of women engineers and ‘other men' in the Department of Irrigation. Other men are conceptualized as a broad category of men, from professionals with a disciplinary background other than engineering to men of ‘low caste' and men with a particular ethnic background. The analysis focusses, however, mainly on the performance of ‘lady engineers' as women engineers in the Department are known. Their marginalized position in the organisation is highly visible whereas subordinated positions of men in the Department are more difficult to detect. Apart from the presence of (male) Madhesi officers, class, caste and ethnic issues among men are difficult to understand ‘within' the Department, because staff with a Dalit background, for instance, constitute only 2{\%} of staff in lower management positions in the organisation. The taboo for women to perform in the field is discussed in relation to the performance of the lady engineer. Also an overview is presented of the disadvantages that lady engineers tend to accumulate in the pursuit of a career in the Department. The analysis reveals that most women engineers come to face a career plateau in their life, causing them to accept office work that is considered of secondary importance, switch jobs or quit service altogether. Chapter 6 analyses the performativity of irrigation data and their use in policy making in Nepal. In the recognition that technical representations of reality help to enact professional credibility and claims of truths of irrigation engineers and water professionals, the focus is on understanding how irrigation data might support (and help to enact) professional performance in irrigation. It is analysed how irrigation data breathe life into particular representations of reality, reflecting and structuring a particular experience in irrigation expert thinking. It is suggested that the ‘show' of irrigation data can also be considered a ‘cultural expression' of authority, professional identities and masculinities in irrigation. This is not to say that women professionals in irrigation would use and construct irrigation data in a different way, but to point out that authority ‘sticks' more easily to male engineers when they use irrigation data, than to female engineers when they use irrigation data. Chapter 7 presents a self-portrait of ‘our knowledges' in irrigation. Speaking about ‘our knowledges' in irrigation – something that is deeply contentious from a feminist perspective – is done as a way to acknowledge my subjectivation as an irrigation professional and to invite fellow members of knowledge and policy elites in development to participate in an exercise of self-discovery. I reconstruct a history of irrigation expert thinking in Nepal based on 60 years of state irrigation interventions in Chitwan District (1950-2010). It is an explorative study, rich in empirical material, also presenting a fresh look at irrigation practices in Chitwan before the 1950s and re-constructing an account of how images of the Tennessee Valley Authority in America served to conceptualize multipurpose watershed management and new irrigation projects in Nepal. Through the use of photos, I also show how engineers have acted as negotiators of knowledge and masculinities in the act of building irrigation systems in Chitwan District. The investigation is based on the assumption that it is worthwhile to scrutinize our expert knowledges in irrigation because our performances and identities of ‘ourselves' – as male and female engineers and professionals – are somehow implicated in it. Treating the historical account as a self-referential experience or self-portrait of professional performances in irrigation, I explore how masculinities have been associated with our expert knowledges. The analysis is also an account of professional performance and practices of masculinities that I have negotiated (and performed) myself, in the act of doing research in irrigation on masculinities. In the last chapter (general discussion and conclusions), I conclude that masculinities are deeply embedded in professional cultures in irrigation – not just in interactions between irrigation engineers and water professionals but also in our knowledges in irrigation. Professional performances and expert knowledges in irrigation are an enactment of ‘projectness' – a particular experience of reality (in projects) which reflects and structures ‘our' understandings of the world in a gendered way, and in which ‘we' hardly have been able to date to accommodate feminist perspectives on irrigation and water management. I also point out that qualifying behaviour or practices of people as (partially) masculine or as an effect of masculinities is controversial among irrigation engineers and water professionals. Irrigation and water management historically is a field of applied engineering, and the argument that masculinities are implicated in professional identities and in irrigation expert knowledge, is disputed. Irrigation engineers and water professionals generally have internalized a conviction that science and engineering is rational and universal, and they propagate the view that engineering itself is disconnected from meanings of masculinity and femininity.Alternate abstract:Dit proefschrift is een verslag van mijn pogingen om mannelijkheid of mannelijkheidsconstructies (masculinities) tussen irrigatie-ingenieurs en water-professionals in Nepal te bestuderen. De irrigatie – en waterbeheer wereld is een echte mannenwereld, maar dit wordt nauwelijks erkend, benoemd en bestudeerd, ondanks veel (politieke) aandacht in de afgelopen twintig jaar voor gender ongelijkheid binnen ontwikkelingsbeleid en – onderzoek. Mijn studie is gebaseerd op de waarneming dat er een stilte valt in het debat binnen irrigatie en ontwikkelingssamenwerking zodra het over professionals, mannen en het masculiene subject gaat. De hypothese van de studie is dat er iets intrinsiek mannelijks is aan de professionele cultuur van irrigatie – en waterbeheer, zowel in het Westen als in Nepal. Deze hypothese is gebaseerd op persoonlijke ervaring; ik ben zelf een man en onderzoeker in waterbeheer, en ik ben opgeleid als irrigatie-professional in Nederland. Verder heb ik tijdens mijn studiereizen in India en Nepal irrigatie-ingenieurs en water-professionals ontmoet in een interculturele context. De hypothese is tevens gebaseerd op academische literatuur waarin mannelijkheid en mannelijkheidsconstructies binnen irrigatie ter discussie staat. Het doel van dit proefschrift is het bevragen van een binnen irrigatie veronderstelde en vanzelfsprekende associatie tussen mannen, organisatorische kundigheid, autoriteit en expertise. In het proefschrift wordt de wereld van irrigatie – en waterbeheer ingedeeld in twee denkbeeldige domeinen: het domein van de irrigatie-ingenieur en water-professional, en het domein van professionele expertise en irrigatiekennis. Voor beide domeinen worden verschillende onderzoeksvragen gesteld. Voor het eerste domein: hoe wordt iemand een irrigatie-ingenieur in Nepal, op het Irrigatiedepartement, en wat zijn de gedragingen, identiteiten en associaties van mannelijkheid die daarbij komen kijken. Voor het tweede domein: hoe zijn mannelijkheidsconstructies, in de breedste zin van het woord, mogelijkerwijs ingebakken in professionele expertise en irrigatiekennis. Om de eerste vraag te beantwoorden analyseert dit proefschrift de instituten van technisch (ingenieurs-) onderwijs, beroepsverenigingen en toezichthoudende beroepsorganen, en het Irrigatiedepartement. Om de tweede vraag te beantwoorden analyseert dit proefschrift de presentatie en het gebruik van data (cijfers en statistieken) in irrigatiebeleid, en het bestudeert veranderingen in professionele expertise en irrigatiekennis in Nepal. Het theoretisch raamwerk van het proefschrift is het perspectief dat ‘professionele performance' binnen irrigatie begrepen kan worden als culturele performance, alsof irrigatieingenieurs en water-professionals acteurs zijn in het maatschappelijke decor, net als in een toneelvoorstelling. Deze voorstelling van professionele performance is ge{\"{i}}nspireerd door het werk van de Britse antropoloog Victor Turner. In hoofdstuk 1 leg ik uit dat de metafoor van ‘performance' zowel begrepen kan worden als technische performance en als culturele 498 performance, twee zijden van dezelfde munt, elkaar ondersteunend en onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden in professionele performance. In het onderzoeksproces ben ik deze theorie gaan zien als zeer toepasselijk voor dit proefschrift. Het heeft mij in staat gesteld om verbindingen te leggen tussen de gender van ingenieurs, professionele beroepsculturen binnen irrigatie en technische representaties van de werkelijkheid in irrigatiekennis, zonder daarbij mijzelf van het analytisch proces uit te sluiten. Dit laatste is belangrijk in onderzoek naar mannelijkheidsconstructies, omdat het identificeren van mannelijkheid en vrouwelijkheid onvermijdelijk een interpretatief, context gebonden en partieel proces is. Hoofdstuk 2 presenteert voor het proefschrift relevante historische achtergronden van irrigatieontwikkeling in Nepal. De belangrijkste overheidsprojecten in de irrigatie sector in Nepal en de veranderingen in de professionele beroepspraktijk binnen irrigatie worden toegelicht. Ook wordt er een achtergrondanalyse gepresenteerd van het onderwijssysteem en de overheidsdiensten in Nepal (vanaf de jaren 1950). Hierbij gaat de aandacht naar gender aspecten in deze instanties en er wordt gewezen op het feit dat deze (publieke) instanties altijd hebben gefunctioneerd als gesloten instituten voor de hoge klasse en hoge kaste elite in Nepal. Dit hoofdstuk documenteert ook een geschiedenis van vrouwen-professionals binnen de Nepalese plattelandsontwikkeling (vanaf de jaren 1950). Het doel hierbij is om te begrijpen waarom er eigenlijk zo weinig vrouwen als irrigatie-ingenieur werkzaam zijn in Nepal. In deze analyse wordt ook ingegaan op de introductie van sociaal werkers (social organisers) in irrigatie, een beleidsmaatregel van de vroege jaren 1990. De vraag is waarom deze ‘sociale' posities in irrigatie niet door vrouwen-professionals zijn opgepakt. De studie laat zien dat de rol van vrouwen-professionals binnen de Nepalese plattelandsontwikkeling altijd beperkt is geweest. De vrouwen-professional werd geacht zich hoofdzakelijk bezig te houden met ‘vrouwen-kwesties' vanwege ‘haar' veronderstelde ‘feminiene kwaliteiten', en niet met andere of bredere vraagstukken in plattelandsontwikkeling. Hoofdstuk 3 presenteert een feministische lezing van de geschiedenis van de belangrijkste instanties op het traject om irrigatie-ingenieur te worden in Nepal. Het eerste instituut is het technisch (ingenieurs-) onderwijs. De analyse richt zich hoofdzakelijk op Nepal, maar het benoemt ook de plaatsen in het buitenland (voornamelijk in India) waar Nepalese mannen (en enkele vrouwen) heen zijn gegaan voor hun onderwijs. De analyse richt zich op het zogenaamde diploma-onderwijs (middelbaar beroepsonderwijs, opleiding tot opzichter) en bachelor-onderwijs (hoger beroepsonderwijs, opleiding tot ingenieur) in civiele techniek en landbouwtechniek. Voor deze disciplines heb ik data verzameld van het aantal studenteninschrijvingen aan ingenieurscolleges, en die gesegregeerd naar gender en kaste (vanaf de jaren 1980). Een tweede set van instanties zijn de toezichthoudende beroepsorganen en de beroepsverenigingen voor de professionele sectoren van water, landbouw en irrigatie. Er wordt een analyse gepresenteerd van ongeveer veertig beroepsverenigingen. Ook worden 499 enkele kleine en beginnende beroepsnetwerken van vrouwen-professionals besproken. Het derde instituut is het Irrigatiedepartement. Haar geschiedenis wordt beschreven vanaf 1952, het jaar dat het Departement is opgericht, en er wordt geanalyseerd wie er werkzaam zijn geweest voor het Departement. De studie van de instituten in dit hoofdstuk laat zien dat deze organisaties altijd echte mannenwerelden zijn geweest. Hoofdstuk 4 richt zich op het informele milieu van het Irrigatiedepartement. Het doel is om te begrijpen hoe een afgestudeerde een ‘echte' irrigatie-ingenieur wordt. De analyse is gebaseerd op de aanname dat het verkrijgen van een ingenieursdiploma, het lid worden van een beroepsvereniging en het krijgen van een baan in het Irrigatiedepartement, iemand niet automatisch tot een ‘echte' irrigatie-ingenieur maakt. De hypothese is dat junior ingenieurs hiervoor actief moeten deelnemen aan het informele milieu van de instituten waar zij toe behoren, en dat zij handelingscapaciteit (agency) en wens of wil moeten ontwikkelen en tonen, alsmede vaardigheden en percepties die ‘passen' bij een normatieve en genderauthentieke performance van een ‘echte' irrigatie ingenieur. In theorie vindt de ontwikkeling van handelingscapaciteit (agency) en wens of wil plaats door twee aparte aan elkaar gerelateerde processen. Deze processen noem ik ‘zelf-normalisatie' en ‘transitionele performance'. De analyse laat zien dat het informele milieu van het Irrigatiedepartement is doorspekt met sociale stereotypen en culturele normen die gangbaar zijn in de (elite-) maatschappij in Nepal. Deze stereotypen en normen vormen barri{\`{e}}res, in het bijzonder voor vrouwen, om een ‘echte' ingenieur te worden. In de analyse worden tevens twee fasen in de levens van ingenieurs beschreven, welke gezien kunnen worden als rites de passage of overgangsrituelen om een irrigatie-ingenieur te worden: de opleidingsjaren op het ingenieurscollege en de eerste veldervaring. Er wordt gesteld dat succesvolle deelname aan deze overgangsrituelen een voorvereiste is om een ‘echte' irrigatie-ingenieur te worden. Hoofdstuk 5 bespreekt de professionele performance van vrouwen-ingenieurs en ‘andere mannen' in het Irrigatiedepartement. De categorie ‘andere mannen' is erg breed, en varieert van mannen met een andere opleidingsachtergrond dan die van ingenieur tot mannen van ‘lagere kasten' of met een bepaalde etnische achtergrond. De analyse richt zich echter hoofdzakelijk op de performance van ‘lady-ingenieurs' (lady engineers), zoals vrouweningenieurs op het Departement bekend staan. Hun gemarginaliseerde positie in de organisatie is goed zichtbaar, terwijl ondergeschikte posities van mannen binnen het Departement moeilijker te ontdekken zijn. Afgezien van de zichtbare aanwezigheid van Madhesi-manneningenieurs, zijn de verschillen tussen mannen naar klasse, kaste en etniciteit binnen het Departement moeilijk te beschouwen. De totale staf met een Dalit-achtergrond omvat bijvoorbeeld minder dan 2{\%} van de organisatie. In verband met de performance van de ladyingenieur wordt het taboe voor vrouwen om naar het veld te reizen uitvoerig geanalyseerd. Er wordt ook een overzicht gepresenteerd van alle nadelen die vrouwen tegenkomen als zij een 500 carri{\`{e}}re als ingenieur in het Departement nastreven. De nadelen hebben een cumulatief effect en de analyse laat zien dat de meeste vrouwen-ingenieurs terecht komen op een ‘carri{\`{e}}replateau'. Dit uit zich in het aanvaarden van kantoorwerk dat laag in aanzien staat, het veranderen van baan of het nemen van ontslag. Hoofdstuk 6 analyseert de actieve werking of ‘performativiteit' van irrigatie-data, en het verzamelen en presenteren daarvan voor irrigatiebeleid in Nepal. De aandacht gaat uit naar het begrijpen hoe de presentatie en het gebruik van data in irrigatiebeleid professionele performances in irrigatie in het leven roepen en ondersteunen. Daarin wordt onderkend dat technische representaties van de werkelijkheid een belangrijke rol spelen in het cre{\"{e}}ren en ondersteunen van professionele autoriteit. De analyse laat zien hoe de presentatie en het gebruik van irrigatie-statistieken (nieuw) leven blazen in bepaalde interpretaties van de werkelijkheid, en dat de representaties daarvan een specifieke ‘werkelijkheid' of ‘ervaring' bespiegelen en structuren binnen professionele expertise en irrigatiekennis. Er wordt getoond dat de presentatie en het gebruik van irrigatie-data ook gezien kan worden als een culturele expressie (‘een show') van autoriteit, professionele identiteiten en mannelijkheidsconstructies binnen irrigatie. Dit is niet hetzelfde als beweren dat vrouwen-irrigatie-professionals data en statistieken op een andere manier (zouden) gebruiken; het betekent dat autoriteit makkelijker ‘vastplakt' aan mannen-ingenieurs dan aan vrouwen-ingenieurs wanneer data en statistieken gepresenteerd en gebruikt worden in het maken van irrigatiebeleid. Hoofdstuk 7 presenteert een zelfportret van ‘onze kennis' binnen irrigatie. Spreken over ‘onze kennis' binnen irrigatie is iets wat feministische denkers onmogelijk achten en waar zij tegen ageren. Ik doe het echter om mijn eigen oogkleppen en (ver)vorming (subjectivation) als irrigatie-professional te erkennen en om collega-professionals en andere experts in ontwikkelingssamenwerking uit te nodigen voor een oefening in zelf-ontdekking. Het hoofdstuk reconstrueert een geschiedenis van irrigatiekennis in Nepal gebaseerd op zestig jaar overheidsinterventies in het district Chitwan (1950-2010). Het is een exploratieve studie, rijk aan empirisch materiaal. Dit hoofdstuk presenteert ook een nieuwe blik op de beoefening van irrigatie in Chitwan van v{\'{o}}{\'{o}}r 1950, en het documenteert hoe het ideaalbeeld van de Tennessee Valley Authority in Amerika diende als inspiratiebron voor multifunctionele stroomgebiedsontwikkeling en nieuwe irrigatie-projecten in Nepal. Mede door het gebruik van foto's laat ik zien hoe ingenieurs en andere professionals hebben gefunctioneerd als doorgeefluik en onderhandelaars van kennis en mannelijkheid tijdens het bouwen van irrigatie-systemen in het district Chitwan. De studie is gebaseerd op de aanname dat het de moeite waard is om onze kennis en expertise binnen irrigatie te onderwerpen aan kritische reflectie omdat onze performances als professionals, onze identiteiten als mannen- en vrouwen-ingenieurs, en onze manier van denken over irrigatieontwikkeling, op {\'{e}}{\'{e}}n of andere manier een associatie hebben met mannelijkheid. Door de geschiedenis te behandelen als een zelf-referenti{\"{e}}le ervaring of 501 zelfportret van professionele performance in irrigatie, probeer ik te ontdekken hoe mannelijkheid geassocieerd is geraakt met onze kennis van irrigatie. De analyse is tevens een verslag van mijn eigen professionele performance en een voorbeeld van een mannelijkheidsconstructie binnen irrigatie die ik zelf heb beoefend en bevraagd tijdens het doen van onderzoek. In het laatste hoofdstuk (algemene discussie en conclusies) concludeer ik dat identiteiten, gedragingen en expressies van mannelijkheid diep ingebakken zijn in de beroepscultuur binnen irrigatie – niet alleen als omgangsvormen in interacties tussen irrigatie-ingenieurs en water-professionals maar ook in ‘onze kennis' binnen irrigatie. Professionele performances in irrigatie en expertise binnen waterbeheer zijn onderhevig aan ‘projectigheid' (projectness) – een specifieke ervaring van de realiteit (in projecten) die ons begrip van de wereld bespiegeld en structureert op een manier die sterke mannelijke connotaties heeft en waarin ‘wij', tot op heden, niet in staat zijn geweest om alternatieve feministische perspectieven op irrigatie en waterbeheer te waarderen. Tevens wijs ik erop dat het kwalificeren van gedrag en acties van mensen als (gedeeltelijk) mannelijk of als een effect van mannelijkheidsconstructies, zeer controversieel is onder irrigatie-ingenieurs en water-professionals. Historisch gezien zijn irrigatie en waterbeheer een beroepenveld van toegepaste techniek, en het argument dat ‘masculiniteiten' sterke associaties hebben met professionele identiteiten en zelfs met irrigatiekennis, wordt doorgaans verworpen. Irrigatie-ingenieurs en water-professionals hebben een overtuiging ge{\"{i}}nternaliseerd dat wetenschap en techniek rationeel en universeel zijn, en zij verkondigen een wereldbeeld waarin techniek zelf los staat van de betekenissen van mannelijkheid en vrouwelijkheid},

abstract = {Sprinkler irrigation is a widely studied subject in scientific and technical literature. Initially studies were mainly conducted experimentally, whereas more recently we can say that the use of simulation models is the rule. To calibrate such models, experimental data of high precision are required to prevent possible errors in simulations. In sprinkler irrigation evaluation the collectors play a central role and should be designed to minimize the perturbation of water application it is measuring. Using the fluid dynamics software program Fluent, several designs of collectors have been analyzed to assess their capabilities for precise water collection under a horizontal wind. The analysis was performed in two steps: (1) evaluation of airflow perturbation due to collector and (2) calculation of collection rate for different droplet diameters and wind velocity on two selected collectors (one minimizing airflow perturbations, one easy to manufacture). The collector design producing the best results was used to create a mold for manufacturing collectors out of injected plastic material.},

abstract = {In South Africa the agricultural sector is a significant energy user, with irrigation pumping being the single biggest electricity-demanding farming activity. The agricultural and commercial sectors contribute 6.5{\%} to annual South African electricity sales. Since 2004, Eskom demand side management (DSM) programmes actively engaged farmers to reduce peak period power usage. Farmers with higher power usage were also assisted to move from Landrate tariff structure to Ruraflex in order to incentivise away from peak-period power use. As part of the DSM programme, a number of large evening peak-load-shifting irrigation projects were implemented. Independent measurement and verification (M{\&}V) assessments were made to establish attained savings over the contracted project life. The M{\&}V of DSM projects normally have problems that complicate project assessments, but even taking this into account, the M{\&}V team experienced exceptional difficulties and cumbersome M{\&}V methodology challenges with certain irrigation projects. Normal baseline development methods were ineffective and novel M{\&}V methods needed to be devised and developed. This paper explains the normal M{\&}V methodology used for typical DSM projects and how it is applied. It gives guidance on baseline metering equipment, sampling and metering point selection. Further it demonstrates project specific issues and service level adjustment (SLA) anomalies that render normal M{\&}V methodologies ineffective. It shows novel and alternative baseline development and SLA methods that were incorporated on DSM projects to accurately quantify project impacts.},

abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is the primary sector demanding water resources in the world. Given that, improved irrigation technologies could play a crucial role in enhancing water use efficiency. This paper uses causal inference estimators to evaluate the effect of these technologies on irrigators at the farm level in two irrigated valleys in Central Chile. Doubly robust estimators were employed to address the selection bias of the adoption of improved irrigation technologies. The results show first a low level of technology adoption, with only 18{\%} of irrigators adopting irrigation, where access to credits and education plays a crucial role in their adoption. Despite this low rate, the estimates show consistently positive and significant impacts on adopters in terms of annual margins and land use. As a result, our research calls for attention towards focusing programs and policy targeting on reducing entry barriers and broadening the adoption of irrigation technologies, allowing to reduce the gap in terms of economic wellbeing and the long-term sustainability and adaptation to climate change of irrigated areas.},

abstract = {Small-scale private irrigation schemes (SPRI) have been the driving force behind the expansion of irrigated areas in Nigeria, despite government efforts to promote large-scale public irrigation schemes. SPRI allows adjustment of irrigation schedules in accordance with observed crop needs. The irrigated area in Nigeria is, however, far below its potential and an increase in farmers{\"{i}}¿½ investment in irrigation is essential. While Nigerian farmers{\"{i}}¿½ low level of investment in irrigation may be partly due to low returns, it is also the result of high transaction costs associated specifically with making such an investment. Although reducing transaction costs is important because the reduction provides farmers with a more enabling environment, transaction costs are often unobservable and little is known about what factors contribute to them. This article empirically assesses the effect of unobserved transaction costs for Nigerian farmers{\"{i}}¿½ when investing in irrigation pumps, using the baseline survey data for the Second Fadama Development Program (Fadama II). The results indicate that the unobserved transaction costs are higher for female landless farmers, with higher dependency ratio and residing far from town. The results suggest that the unobserved transaction costs can be as important as the factors determining the profitability of irrigation pump, emphasizing the importance of reducing transaction costs in addition to improving the environment for higher return from irrigation investment.},

abstract = {Since the passage of the 1996 Farm Act, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has provided over {\$}10 billion in technology adoption subsidies. One of the national conservation priorities in EQIP is water conservation, but it is not known how participation in EQIP by irrigators affects water application rates and decisions to expand or reduce a farm's irrigated acreage. Using a farm-level panel data set drawn from three national samples of irrigators taken in 1998, 2003, and 2008, this study provides the first national scale econometric estimates of the changes in water application rates and irrigated acreage that result when a farm receives EQIP payments. Due to a five-fold increase in EQIP funding following the 2002 farm bill, the change in EQIP participation between 2008 and earlier years is largely the result of an exogenous policy shock. A difference-in-differences estimator that exploits this change in EQIP funding and also controls for unobserved farm-specific variables, suggests that for the average farm participating in EQIP between 2004 and 2008, the EQIP payments may have reduced water application rates but also may have increased total water use and led to an expansion in irrigated acreage. However, since EQIP participation is voluntary, there may still be a need to correct for bias due to sample selection. A nearest neighbor matching estimator finds no evidence of any statistically significant effect of EQIP participation on technology adoption rates, water use, water application rates or acreages, which suggests that there is a high degree of self-selection into the program.},

abstract = {This thesis describes the organisation and performance of two large-scale irrigation systems in the North Coast of Peru. Good water management is important in this area because water is scarce and irrigated agriculture provides a livelihood to many small and middle-sized farmers. Water in the coast of Peru is considered to be badly managed, however this study shows that performance is more optimal than critics assume. Apart from the relevance in the local water management discussion, the study also addresses two internationally much debated topics in irrigation water management: irrigation management transfer (from government to water users' associations) and modernisation of infrastructure.Large-scale irrigation is often associated with low water use efficiencies, low control over the deliveries and low fee-recovery. Volumetric water control is one of the solutions proposed to solve these problems. The idea behind volumetric water control is to allocate and schedule precise volumes of water to meet crop water requirements, if possible on request of the water users. The user is charged per volume of water used to prevent over-use, and to raise sufficient funds to operate and maintain the irrigation system. Many authors stress the difficulties of volumetric water control. For example: on-request scheduling is too costly in large systems with many smallholders. High-tech automatic water control systems are too expensive and difficult to operate and maintain. Setting of the Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) might be too low to provide an incentive for water saving, or might be too high for poor farmers to pay.The study aims to achieve a better understanding of the practices in organisation and performance of volumetric water control in two large-scale irrigation systems in the North Coast. The coastal zone of Peru is extremely arid. Precipitation is near zero, except once in about 15 years when the El Ni{\~{n}}o phenomenon brings heavy rains and floods. The irrigation systems depend on the highly irregular rivers, which flow from the Andean Mountains. Main crops in the coastal areas are: sugarcane, rice and maize. Two systems were selected for a comparative study: Chancay-Lambayeque (100,000 ha) and Jequetepeque (40,000 ha). In the Chancay-Lambayeque system the users pay US{\$} 2 per 576 m 3scheduled to be delivered at field level. In the Jequetepeque system the farmers pay a fixed fee according to the crop allowed to grow. For example they pay US{\$} 60 per hectare of rice.The analytical framework highlights two main points: First, the irrigation infrastructure has certain properties, because different stakeholders designed and constructed parts of it in the past. These properties set certain requirements for use. For example the manually operated, undershot gates need skilled and experienced personnel to operate them well. The properties of the infrastructure also affect the water distribution in particular ways. For example a system with undershot offtakes and no check structures in the ongoing canal transports all fluctuations in the inflow to the tail-end of the canals. This affects the farmers in these areas. Second, the organisations can be regarded as 'semi-autonomous fields' where rules and regulations are transformed and local regulations are applied. Social power relations, technical properties, environmental conditions and the interests of actors influence the rules that are used, how and when. The different organisations that manage the irrigation system form a complex entity. At different levels in the system; water users' organisations, private companies and government agencies play a role in water management. This complex entity can be studied by looking at the domains of authority the organisations have, the rules they use, and the structure of decision-making and accountability between the organisations. Conflicts can reveal the rules used and the power plays involved. During one and a half year field research many key informants and water users were interviewed and a water flow measurement programme was executed.Chapter 2 describes the setting of the two irrigation systems: the natural resources, the long history of irrigation in the area and the present production systems. As the coast is arid and plain, waterlogging and salinity are dangers of irrigation. Irrigation began already 3000 years ago. The present main canal of the Chancay-Lambayeque system was built around AD 1000 and the irrigated area then was larger than today. After the conquest the Spaniards largely continued the management of the Incas. Only when the new settlers claimed increasingly more land for their haciendas, conflicts about water grew. State interventions in the management of the systems started early 20 thcentury. At that time the idea of volumetric water control was proposed. However, it was not until the Agrarian Reform of 1969, when the management became completely in the hands of the State, that volumetric allocation and delivery was introduced. And only with the Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) to the Comisiones de Regantes and Juntas de Usuarios in 1992 volumetric charging was enforced. Today sugarcane and rice are cultivated in high input - high output production systems. Main problem for the small and middle-sized landowners is to obtain credit. The local rice purchasers ( molinos ) provide credit, which leads often to ever greater indebtedness of the smallholders. Execpt for the three sugarcane co-operatives the average landholding is 5 ha.Chapter 3 introduces the complex structure of the entities that manage the irrigation systems. Since the Irrigation Management Transfer in 1992 the Comisiones de Regantes (CRs) at the level of the secondary canals operate and maintain the secondary canals. The board of the Comisiones is elected by all water users. For the operation the board hires staff. At the level of the tertiary canals the Comit{\'{e}}s de Canal maintain (and sometimes operate) the tertiary canals. In 1994 (for Chancay-Lambayeque) and 1998 (for Jequetepeque) the Juntas de Usuarios formed private companies to take over the operation and maintenance of the main canal and reservoirs. The local irrigation offices of the Ministry of Agriculture (ATDR) retained the authority to allocate water (up to the individual plot level) and supervise the management by the water users' organisation. Besides the ATDR also the Autonomous Watershed Authorities (AACH) and the Special Project Bureaus are government organisations that have certain domains of authority in water management.The main difference in water use between the systems is that the water users in Jequetepeque apply on average twice as much water per hectare of the same crop compared to the users in Chancay-Lambayeque. This is not caused by the volumetric payment in Chancay, but by the difference in water availability per hectare. After the Land Reform the Chancay system was expanded to win political support with the new water users, whereas in Jequetepeque the luxurious water right position acquired by the haciendas was not changed.Chapter 4 describes the practices of volumetric water allocation and scheduling. The National Water Law of 1969 establishes that all water is property of the State and that the ATDR is the organisation that gives concessions for use to individual water users. The ATDR also establishes how much water each user can request maximum depending on the defined cropping zones. However, for the scheduling of water turns according to the cropping plan the ATDR depends on the Comisiones de Regantes . The Comisiones , however, generally comply with the cropping plan to avoid claims of water users for water they are entitled to. Apart from the permanent water rights ( licencia ) there are also water titles for excess water ( permiso ). This institution was already known in the pre-Inca times. It is an adaptation to the ever fluctuating river supplies. In Chancay-Lambayeque water is scheduled in ' riegos' . One riego is one hour of water delivery with 160 l/s at field level. The water users pay in advance and get the hours the next day. In Jequetepeque the turns are only scheduled at the beginning of the rice-growing season. During the remainder of the rice-growing season the water flows continuously from field to field.In water scarce periods, when supply is less than expected, the Junta de Usuarios together with the ATDR adjust the water allocations. In Chancay-Lambayeque all water users then get scheduled a fixed number of hours each 15 days. The number of riegos per hectare is proportionally less the bigger the landholding of the farmer. This results in plots only party planted with rice, but more often in plots completely planted, but deficiently irrigated. In Jequetepeque water scarcity comes less unexpected, because the reservoir has sufficient capacity for an irrigation season. Here certain campos (small clusters of fields) are excluded from rice growing when the reservoir is low.In Chapter 5 an assessment is made of the volumetric water delivery. First a framework for understanding delivery performance is given. In this framework three main factors are central: the physical infrastructure, the operators, and the water users. However, in the first place the Relative Water Supply (RWS) should be looked at. The RWS is the ratio of the delivered water and the crop water requirements. If the RWS at field level is higher than 1.5 water can be used as a substitute for control. An intensive water flow measurement programme was executed to assess the performance of the water delivery service. Water flows were measured at all levels of the canal system: from offtakes from the main canal to deliveries at field level. The Chancay-Lambayeque system with its manually operated undershot gates, few measurement structures, open and unlined canals, its irregular river supply, and complicated on-request scheduling for 22,000 water users is a 'nightmare' system. Nevertheless, the Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR) was remarkably close to 1.0 at different levels of the system, indicating that the actually delivered flows were as programmed. This together with a RWS of between 0.6 and 0.8 at field level leads to a high water productivity. The remarkably good water delivery performance was explained by the skills of the operators and the accountability of the boards of the Comisiones towards the water users. This accountability was a result of the board members wanting to win the next elections to remain in the position to make money from illegal water selling. Also radio and newspapers were used to exert pressure on the boards to perform well. In Jequetepeque the DPR was almost always above 1.0 indicating that there was more water distributed than programmed. This was explained by the fact the in Jequetepeque the RWS was about 2.Chapter 6 focuses on the financial conduct of the two irrigation systems. The charge for the water delivery service is set by the General Assemblies of the water users. They prioritise the expenditures of the Comisiones and therewith set the fee. The fees are recovered by the Junta de Usuarios (or its private company) and then distributed over the different organisations that manage the systems. The fee recovery was high. In Chancay-Lambayeque from 1993 to 1998 more than ninety percent of the distributed water was paid for (per volume). Users paid per riego , thus recovery was spread throughout the irrigation season. The advance payment could be enforced quite well because o social and technical control over the water. Only the sugarcane co-operatives in the head-end of the system took water without paying. A drawback of volumetric charging is that less river supply means less income for the organisations. Also in Jequetepeque the fee recovery was high. Here the farmers did not pay per volume and the recovery was harder to enforce because of abundant water availability. Therefore, the Junta collected the fees at the beginning of the irrigation season when the system was still dry but the rice farmers need to start their nurseries. By strict control over the water to only those users who had paid the fees of last year the Junta recovered the fees. The farmers could not wait with their nurseries until water would be available abundantly because a later start would mean a yield reduction due to low temperatures at the end of the season. This construction of technical, environmental and institutional elements that enforces the payment was called an 'obligatory point of passage'.Between 1.5 to 3.0 million dollars were collected each year in each system. This was more or less sufficient for operation and maintenance and paying taxes. The distribution of thewas such that the Comisiones had insufficient budget for maintenance, however, the maintenance of the tertiary canals was done by the Comites de Canal, and some subsidies became available from the 1998 El Nino floods. Chapter 7 evaluates the functioning and effects of volumetric water allocation, scheduling, delivery and charging. It is concluded that water control in Chancay-Lambayeque is volumetric. In Jequetepeque water allocation and distribution is only volumetric to a certain extent, and charging is not related to the volume actually applied to the field. In both systems there are two important factors shaping water management. First, the history of the institutions and physical infrastructure. Despite the many abrupt changes in the institutional setting the continuities in the long history contributed to the legitimacy of the rules and the functionality of the infrastructure. Second, the contemporary institutions bring about a power balance among the various organisations involved in irrigation management. The governance of the organisation follows surprisingly strictly the National Water Law. Only some minor rules are not complied with. Rule-compliance is partly enforced by social control among 'equal' parties: e.g. farmers in the tertiary block guard their water against theft, and engineers of the Comisiones ensure they get allocated water for their Subsector according to the rules. Rules are also enforced by the governmental organisations ATDR and AACH. They judge about certain types of conflicts (on rule violation) inside the users' organisations. Punishment of rule violation is also used in political ways: a fine by the ATDR implies exclusion of the involved water user from the next election of the board of the Comisi{\'{o}}n .The effect of volumetric water control on productivity of water is small. It is much more the water availability per hectare that determines the productivity of water. The water in Chancay-Lambayeque is 'stretched' over a much bigger area compared with Jequeteque making water more productive per volume of water applied. The volumetric charging affected livelihoods of poor farmers because it was difficult for them to find the money to pay the water turns when the crops required water. However, as the production system is high input - high output, the farmers invest much money anyway and the water fee is only 5 to 10 percent of the total input costs. The payment per volume made the board and staff of the Comisiones somewhat more accountable in water delivery to the water users.It is concluded in Chapter 8 that the power balance between the water users, different water users' organisations, private company and different public agencies shaped a well functioning entity. The general governance regulations were complied with, but locally rules on allocation, scheduling, maintenance and fee setting were refined and negotiated. It was also concluded that the analytical framework and research methods used in the comparative study were useful in revealing the complex nature of the irrigation management.Alternate abstract:Dit proefschrift beschrijft de organisatie van twee grootschalige irrigatiesystemen aan de noordkust van Peru. Grootschalige irrigatie wordt vaak geassocieerd met lage watergebruiksefficienties, slechte controle over de waterdistributie en slechte financiele prestaties. Volumetrisch waterbeheer is een van de oplossingen die worden voorgesteld om deze problemen op te lossen. Het idee achter volumetrische waterbeheer is om precieze volumes van water toe te wijzen (op aanvraag van de boer) die de waterbehoefte van de gewassen dekt. De gebruiker betaalt per gebruikt volume om over-gebruik te voorkomen en om over voldoende financiele middelen te beschikken voor het gebruik en onderhoud van het irrigatiesysteem. De exacte volumes dienen op precies het goede tijdstip en op precies de goede plaats geleverd te worden. Daarom kunnen we stellen dat volumetrische watercontrole drie dimensies heeft: volumetrische water toekenning, volumetrische water aflevering, en volumetrische betaling. Veel auteurs benadrukken de moeilijkheden van volumetrisch water beheer. Bijvoorbeeld: volumetrische levering aan kleine boeren in een groot systeem zou te duur zijn. Hightech automatische water controle technologieen zouden te duur zijn en te moeilijk zijn in gebruik en onderhoud. De vaststelling van de waterheffing zou te laag kunnen zijn om een prikkel te geven voor water besparing of zou te hoog kunnen zijn voor arme boeren. De studie heeft als doel te komen tot een beter begrip van organisatie en prestatie in de praktijk van volumetrisch waterbeheer in twee grootschalige irrigatiesystemen aan de noordkust van Peru. De kust van Peru is extreem droog. Neerslag is bijna nul, behalve tijdens de El Nino regens en overstromingen die eens in de 15 jaar optreden. De irrigatiesystemen verkrijgen hun water uit rivieren die uit de Andes stromen met heel onregelmatige afvoer. De belangrijkste gewassen in de kust zijn: suikerriet, rijst en mai's. Twee systemen werden uitgekozen voor een vergelijkende studie: Chancay-Lambayeque en Jequetepeque. In het 100.000 ha grootte Chancay-Lambayeque systeem betalen de gebruikers 2 dollar voor aflevering van 576 m3 water op veldniveau. In het 40.000 ha grootte Jequetepeque betalen de gebruikers een vaste heffing per hectare afhankelijk van het gewas waarvoor toestemming is verkregen. Bijvoorbeeld 60 dollar voor een hectare rijst. De redenen voor deze verschillende wijze van betaling en de effecten daarvan werden bestudeerd. Verschillende concepten worden gepresenteerd die gezamenlijk een analytisch kader vormen om irrigatie beheer te bestuderen. Op de eerste plaats worden irrigatiesystemen gedefinieerd als sociaaltechnisch entiteiten, waar water, infrastructuur, water gebruikers, hun organisatie en overheidsinstanties de belangrijkste elementen vormen. Water wordt toegekend aan gebruikers volgens bepaalde principes: 'eigendomsregimes' en waterrechten. Irrigatiewater wordt gecontroleerd door de infrastructuur. De mate van controle die nodig is hangt af van het type kanalen (open of pijpleidingen) en verdeelwerken (vast of te reguleren). De relatieve water voorziening (schaarste of overschot) bei'nvloedt het beheer van de infrastructuur. Extra water kan dienen als een substituut voor controle. Bepaalde belanghebbenden beinvloeden het ontwerp en de constructie van irrigatie infrastructuur. Die infrastructuur heeft daarom bepaalde voorwaarden voor gebruik. Bijvoorbeeld: handmatig te bedienen verdeelwerken vereisen een goed geschoolde en ervaren bediener. De specifieke eigenschappen van de infrastructuur hebben ook specifieke effecten op de waterverdeling. Bijvoorbeeld een systeem met 'undershot' verdeelwerken en zonder regulatiewerken in de doorgaande kanalen transporteert de fluctuaties in de debieten naar het einde van de kanalen. Dit benadeelt de boeren in deze gebieden. De verschillende organisaties die het irrigatiesysteem beheren vormen samen een complexe entiteit. Watergebruikers-organisaties, prive-bedrijven en overheidsinstanties spelen een rol in het waterbeheer op verschillende niveaus in het systeem. Deze complexe entiteit kan bestudeerd worden door te kijken naar de 'domeinen van autoriteit' die de verschillende organisaties hebben, de regels die zij gebruiken, en de structuren van besluitvorming en verantwoording tussen de verschillende organisaties. Macht speelt een belangrijke rol in de interacties in, en tussen, de organisaties. Conflicten brengen de regels die gebruikt worden en de machtsrelaties aan het licht. Gedurende anderhalf jaar veldonderzoek werden velen sleutelinformanten en watergebruikers gei'nterviewd. Tevens werd er een intens debiet meetprogramma uitgevoerd om de waterdistributie te evalueren. Er werden debieten gemeten op alle relevante niveaus in de systemen: van hoofdsysteem tot veldniveau. In hoofdstuk 2 wordt de context van de twee systemen geschetst: de natuurlijke hulpbronnen, de lange geschiedenis van irrigatie in de gebieden, en de huidige productie systemen. Omdat de kust droog en vlak is kan irrigatie verzouting en een te hoge grondwaterstand veroorzaken. De grote fluctuaties in de rivierafvoer, tussen jaren en gedurende het irrigatie seizoen, bemoeilijken het waterbeheer. Irrigatie werd reeds 3000 jaar geleden ontwikkeld en het huidige hoofdkanaal van Chancay-Lambayeque werd 1000 jaar geleden aangelegd. Rond die tijd was het gei'rrigeerde areaal groter dan het huidige areaal. Na de verovering door de Spanjaarden werd het waterbeheer van de Inca's voortgezet. Pas toen de haciendas steeds meer land opeisten groeiden de conflicten. Overheidsbemoeienis begon in het begin van de 20ste  eeuw. Toen werd het idee van volumetrisch waterbeheer gei'ntroduceerd. Echter, de overheid kon volumetrische watertoekenning en distributie pas toepassen nadat zij het waterbeheer in zijn geheel had overgenomen na de Land Hervorming in 1969. Volumetrische betaling werd pas ingevoerd na de overdracht van het beheer van de systemen van de overheid door Comisiones de Regantes en Junta de Usuarios in 1992. Suikerriet en rijst worden tegenwoordig geproduceerd in een systeem dat gekenmerkt wordt door hoge input en hoge opbrengsten. Krediet is voor de kleine en middel grote boeren het grootste probleem. De locale rijstopkopers (molinos) leveren kredieten die leiden tot steeds groter wordende schulden van de boeren. Hoofdstuk 3 beschrijft de complexe structuur van de entiteiten die de irrigatiesystemen beheren. Sinds de overdracht in 1992 beheren de Comisiones de Regantes de kanalen op secondair niveau. Deze watergebruikers-organisaties distribueren het water en onderhouden de infrastructuur. Het bestuur van de Comisiones de Regantes wordt gekozen door de watergebruikers. Het bestuur neemt personeel aan voor het dagelijks beheer. Op het niveau van tertiaire vakken onderhouden de Comites de Canal de kanalen, en soms distribueren ze het water. Juntas de Usuarios zijn overkoepelende organisaties op hoofdsysteemniveau. De Juntas de Usuarios formeerden (in 1994 voor Chancay-Lambayeque en in 1998 voor Jequetepeque) prive-bedrijven voor het beheren van de hoofdinfrastructuur: hoofdkanaal, reservoir en hoofdinlaatwerken. Het lokale irrigatiekantoor van het Ministerie van Landbouw (ATDR) behield de autoriteit om water toe te wijzen (op veldniveau) en het beheer van de verschillende watergebruikers-organisaties te controleren. Naast de ATDR zijn ook de Autonome Stroomgebiedinstantie (AACH) en de Speciale Project Bureaus overheidsorganisaties die bepaalde bevoegdheden hebben in het waterbeheer. Het watergebruik per hectare voor dezelfde gewassen was in Jequetepeque twee maal zo hoog in vergelijking met Chancay-Lambayeque. Dit werd echter niet veroorzaakt door de volumetrische betaling in Chancay-Lambayeque, maar door de lagere waterbeschikbaarheid in Chancay-Lambayeque. Na de Land Hervorming werd het Chancay-Lambayeque systeem uitgebreid in rail voor politieke steun. Terwijl het Jequetepeque systeem haar luxueuze water rechten uit de hacienda-tijd kon behouden. Hoofdstuk 4 beschrijft de toewijzing van waterrechten en de vaststelling van de waterbeurten. De Nationale Waterwet van 1969 stelt dat alle water eigendom is van de Staat. De ATDR geeft de gebruiksconcessies uit aan individuele gebruikers. Dit gebeurde op basis van bestaand recht. De ATDR bepaalt ook hoeveel water elke gebruiker maximaal mag aanvragen afhankelijk van de ingestelde gewaszone. De ATDR is afhankelijk van de Comisiones de Regantes voor de uitvoering van de regels. De Comisiones gebraiken de officiele regels omdat ze claims van watergebruikers willen vermijden die aanspraak maken op de officiele watertoedeling. Er bestaan twee soorten waterrechten: licencia en permiso. Licencia is een permanent waterrecht. Permiso is een recht op water bij een eventueel overschot in de rivier. Dit verschil bestond al in the Inca-tijd, en is een reactie op de sterk fluctuerende rivierafvoeren. In Chancay-Lambayeque wordt water gedistribueerd in 'riegos'. Een riego is een uur water levering met 160 1/s op veldniveau. Bij voldoende water kunnen de boeren zoveel water kopen als ze willen. Ze betalen de dag van tevoren. In Jequetepeque worden individuele beurten alleen in het begin van het rijstgroeiseizoen geprogrammeerd. Gedurende de rest van het rijstgroeiseizoen stroomt het water continue van veld naar veld. In waterschaarse perioden, als er minder water is dan verwacht, passen de Junta de Usuarios en de ATDR samen de watertoewijzingen aan. In Chancay-Lambayeque worden er dan een vast aantal uren per hectare geprogrammeerd met een vaste irrigatie interval van 15 dagen. Het aantal uren dat wordt toegewezen is proportioned kleiner bij een groter landbezit. Boeren kunnen er dan voor kiezen een deel van hun land voldoende te irrigeren of hun gehele perceel deficient te irrigeren. In Jequetepeque komt waterschaarste minder als een verrassing, omdat het reservoir groter is. Hier worden bepaalde stukken land (campos) uitgesloten van het verbouwen van rijst als er weinig water in het reservoir zit. In hoofdstuk 5 wordt de volumetrische waterdistributie geevalueerd. Eerst wordt er een analysekader gepresenteerd. In dit analysekader staan drie factoren centraal: de infrastructuur, het waterverdeel-personeel, en de watergebruikers. Echter, op de eerste plaats is er gekeken naar de relatieve waterbeschikbaarheid. Als er meer dan anderhalf maal meer water beschikbaar is dan nodig voor de gewassen kan water gebruikt worden als substituut voor controle. Chancay-Lambayeque kan beschouwd worden als een 'nachtmerrie'-systeem: handmatige 'undershot' verdeelwerken, weinig meetstructuren, open kanalen, onregelmatige rivierafvoeren, en een gecompliceerd irrigatiebeurten-systeem op aanvraag van de 22.000 watergebruikers. Desondanks kwam de gemeten waterdistributie erg dicht bij de geprogrammeerde waterdistributie. Dit kan verklaard worden door de grote kunde van het waterdistributie-personeel en de verantwoording die het bestuur moet afleggen naar de watergebruikers. Dit sterke mechanisme van verantwoording kwam tot stand doordat het bestuur bij aankomende verkiezingen herkozen wenste te worden in verband met het inkomen uit illegale verkoop van water. Ook radio en kranten werden gebruikt om verantwoording af te dwingen. In Jequetepeque werd meestal meer water afgeleverd dan geprogrammeerd. Dit hield verband met de ruime beschikbaarheid van water. Hoofdstuk 6 gaat in op het financieel beheer van de twee irrigatiesystemen. De Algemene Vergadering van de Comisiones stelt de hoogte van de heffing vast. De heffingen worden betaald aan de Junta de Usuarios, die vervolgens het geld verdeelt over de verschillende gebruikers en overheidsorganisaties. In Chancay-Lambayeque werd in de periode van 1993 tot 1998 meer dan negentig procent van de heffingen daadwerkelijk (per volume) betaald. Dit kon bereikt worden door de hoge mate van technische en sociale controle over het water. Alleen de suikerriet cooperaties in het begin van het systeem namen water zonder de heffing te betalen. Een nadeel van de volumetrische heffing is dat bij weinig rivierafvoer er ook weinig inkomen voor de organisaties is. In Jequetepeque waren de betalingen moeilijker af te dwingen vanwege de ruime water beschikbaarheid. De Junta kon echter de betaling afdwingen in het begin van het rijstgroeiseizoen. Het land was dan nog droog en de boeren moesten voor een bepaalde datum hun rijstzaaibedden klaar hebben in verband met lage temperaturen die de oogst verminderen aan het eind van het seizoen. Door een strikte controle over deze eerste water beurten kon de Junta in Jequetepeque de betaling van de heffingen (van het voorafgaande jaar) afdwingen. Deze combinatie van technische, omgevings-, en institutionele elementen die de betaling afdwingen wordt in de studie een 'verplicht passeerpunt' genoemd. In totaal werd ieder jaar tussen de 1,5 en 3,0 miljoen dollar aan heffingen betaald. Dit was ongeveer voldoende voor het gebruik en onderhoud van het systeem en de belastingen die betaald moesten worden. Echter, de verdeling over de organisaties was dusdanig dat de Comisiones te weinig fondsen hadden voor onderhoud. Het onderhoud van de tertiaire en hoofdkanalen was echter voldoende. Enige subsidie voor onderhoud kwam binnen via een herstelproject na de El Nino overstromingen van 1998. Hoofdstuk 7 gaat in op het functioneren en de effecten van volumetrisch waterbeheer. Er kan worden geconcludeerd dat het waterbeheer in Chancay-Lambayeque inderdaad volumetrisch is. In Jequetepeque wordt het water volumetrisch toegekend en verdeeld (op hoofdsysteem niveau), maar niet betaald naar gebruikt volume. In beide systemen zijn er twee belangrijke krachten die waterbeheer bei'nvloeden. Op de eerste plaats de geschiedenis van de instituties en infrastructuur. Ondanks de abrupte veranderingen in de institutionele opzet is er ook veel continui'teit in de lange geschiedenis die heeft bijgedragen aan de legitimiteit van de regels en de functionaliteit van de infrastructuur. Op de tweede plaats de machtsbalans tussen de verschillende gebruikers- en overheidsorganisaties. De structuur van het bestuur was vrijwel geheel volgens de officiele regels uit de Water Wet. Bijvoorbeeld alleen de hoogte van de heffingen en boetes was niet conform de wet. Handhaving van de regels werd deels afgedwongen door sociale controle tussen 'gelijkwaardige' partijen, bijvoorbeeld de boeren in het tertiaire vak of de ingenieurs van de Comisiones. De regels werden ook gehandhaafd door de overheidsinstanties ATDR en AACH. Zij speelden een rol in het oplossen van conflicten binnen de gebruikersorganisaties. Het straffen van overtredingen werd op een 'politieke' manier gebruikt: een boete van de ATDR betekent dat een watergebruiker uitgesloten wordt voor een volgende verkiezing van het bestuur. Het effect van betalen per volume op de productiviteit van water is klein. De algehele waterbeschikbaarheid is veel belangrijker. In Chancay-Lambayeque wordt het water veel wijder 'uitgesmeerd'. Dat maakt het water productiever. Het betalen per volume werkte nadelig uit voor armen boeren. Zij hebben vaak geen geld om op tijd hun irrigatiebeurten te kunnen aanvragen. Echter, de kosten voor water zijn maar 5 tot 10 procent van de totale productiekosten. En een voordeel van de betaling per beurt is dat de aflevering beter afgedwongen kan worden door de Comisiones. In hoofdstuk 8 wordt geconcludeerd dat het machtsevenwicht tussen de verschillende gebruikersorganisaties, de prive bedrijven en de overheidsinstanties een functionele entiteit bewerkstelligt. De algemene overheidsregels werden gevolgd, maar de regels voor watertoekenning, onderhoud, en heffingen werden lokaal verder uitgewerkt. Er kan geconcludeerd worden dat het gebruikte analytische kader en de gebruikte onderzoeksmethoden nuttig waren bij het ontrafelen en begrijpen van de complexe structuur van het waterbeheer.},

abstract = {AIMS: The presence of foodborne pathogens in preharvest agricultural water has been identified as a potential contamination source in outbreak investigations, driving markets and auditing bodies to begin requiring water treatment for high‐risk produce. Therefore, it is essential that we identify water treatment methods which are effective as well as practical in their application on farm. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this work, we evaluated two sanitizers which are most prominent in preharvest agricultural water treatment (calcium hypochlorite (free chlorine: 3–5 ppm) and peracetic acid (PAA: 5 ppm)), an EPA registered antimicrobial device (ultraviolet light (UV)), in addition to a combination approach (chlorine + UV, PAA + UV). Treatments were evaluated for their ability to inactivate total coliforms and generic Escherichia coli and consistency in treatment efficacy over 1 h of operation. Physicochemical variables were measured along with microbial populations at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min of operation. Escherichia coli and coliform counts showed a significant (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) reduction after treatment, with combination and singular treatments equally effective at inactivating E. coli and coliforms. A significant increase (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) in oxidation–reduction potential was seen during water treatment (Chlorine; UV + Chlorine), and a significant reduction (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) in pH was seen after PAA and PAA + UV treatments (60 min). CONCLUSION: Overall, the results indicate that all treatments evaluated are equally efficacious for inactivating E. coli and coliforms present in surface agricultural water. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This information when paired with challenge studies targeting foodborne pathogens of interest can be used to support grower decisions when selecting and validating a preharvest agricultural water treatment programme.},

abstract = {Understanding current residential irrigation behaviors is essential for selecting the most effective conservation measures and determining which customers should be targeted for conservation outreach programs. This study stratified single-family residential customers without access to reuse water into irrigating groups. Irrigation demands were calculated using monthly total (indoor and outdoor combined) water billing and parcel records for more than 165,000 customers in southwest Florida over approximately 10 years. Gross irrigation required (GIR) was calculated using parcel and high-resolution site data. Seven-and-a-half percent of customers used no irrigation over the study period, 67{\%} of customers used 1 in./month or less, and 84{\%} used less than the average monthly GIR of 2.2 in./month. Eighty-five percent of customers were classified as occasional irrigators, whereas only 2{\%} were classified as high irrigators. With such low estimated irrigation demands, this study reinforces the importance of selecting conservation methods so as to not inadvertently increase irrigation.},

abstract = {Risks and hazards associated with climate change and geological factors, especially in the world's youngest mountains, are inevitable and may have been exacerbated in recent decades. However reports about increased landslips and landslides in some areas are being presented as examples to argue that most natural hazards in mountain areas are due to climate change. Based on a field study in the Yourjogh area of Chitral District in Pakistan, we argue that this discourse is based on generalized conclusions that do not hold in all cases and for all types of disasters. Our study challenges the climate change discourse as disregarding the political dimension of water management that also contributes to landslides and landslips in Pakistan's mountainous regions. The climate change discourse has taken the politics out of external-donor-led development interventions that replaced traditional irrigation management practices and institutions with an arrangement in which external development agencies and the state control crucial economic and social processes that shape the distribution of water. This not only depoliticizes disasters and their effects but also leads to further mismanagement of abundantly available irrigation water, contributing to the frequent occurrence of landslips in our study area. We conclude that attributing hazards only to climatic or geological factors leaves little room to promote locally appropriate solutions for locally created hazards.},

abstract = {For sea turtles, like many oviparous species, increasing temperatures during development threaten to increase embryonic mortality, alter offspring quality, and potentially create suboptimal primary sex ratios. Various methods are being implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change on reproductive success, but these methods, such as breeding programs, translocations, and shading, are often invasive and expensive. Irrigation is an alternative strategy for cooling nests that, depending on location, can be implemented relatively quickly and cheaply. However, multiple factors, including ambient conditions, nest substrate, and species characteristics, can influence irrigation success. Additionally, irrigation can vary in duration, frequency, and the volume of water applied to nests, which influences the cooling achieved and embryonic survival. Thus, it is critical to understand how to maximize cooling and manage risks before implementing irrigation as a nest-cooling strategy. We reviewed the literature on nest irrigation to examine whether artificial irrigation is feasible as a population management tool. Key factors that affected cooling were the volume of water applied and the frequency of applications. Embryonic responses varied with species, ambient conditions, and the timing of irrigation during development. Nest inundation was the key risk to a successful irrigation regime. Future irrigation regimes must identify clear targets, either primary or adult sex ratios, that maximize population viability. Monitoring population responses and adjusting the irrigation regime in response to population characteristics will be critical. Most studies reported on the manipulation of only one or two variables, further research is required to understand how altering multiple factors in an irrigation regime influences the cooling achieved and embryonic responses.},

abstract = {Many farmers in the Jordan Valley have switched from traditional surface irrigation to pressurized irrigation systems. In order for these pressurized irrigation methods to be effective, farmers must have adequate flow and pressure at each Farm Turnout Assembly (FTA). No on-demand irrigation concept has yet been implemented in the Jordan Valley, and the rotation concept is still in use today. The Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) is the agency responsible for the distribution of water to farmers in the Valley. JVA engineers were used to implement the irrigation rotation schedule, without any attention being paid to its effect on the pressure in the network. Using MS Excel, a computer spreadsheet model was created to examine the effect of selected rotation on the pressure in the network. This model was called the Turnout Pressure Simulation Program (TPSP). The TPSP model was used to map and identify farms that will incur pressure problems with any of the selected rotation schedules. This model was tested in the northern part of a pilot pressurized irrigation network known as TO2, and included 131 irrigated farm units (400 ha) located in Adassiyeh at the northern end of the Jordan Valley. The TPSP model was also used to study illegal openings and the effect of these on the pressure in the network. The effect of four, eight, and 12 illegal openings was studied for a selected rotation schedule, and an average reduction in pressure of 12{\%}, 30{\%}, and 44{\%} was noted compared to when there were no illegal openings.},

abstract = {The impacts of reclaimed wastewater irrigation on the nutrient loads agricultural watershed containing rice paddy fields were assessed. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in irrigation return flows from the rice paddy fields were simulated using the field-sale water quality model Chemical, Runoff, and Erosion from Agricultural Management System model for rice paddy fields (CREAMS-PADDY). The output from CREAMS-PADDY was used as input data for Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model. Simulations indicated that TN and TP loads from the paddy fields increased by 207 percent and 1022 percent when reclaimed wastewater was used for irrigation compared to conventional irrigation. Irrigating paddy fields with reclaimed wastewater increased the TN load at the watershed outlet by 10.3 percent and TP by 14.0 percent. The results concluded that the procedure could be used to develop wastewater reuse strategies that minimized environmental impacts on watershed water quality.},

It is important to allow necessary farming operations with heavy equipment at harvesting times while still providing adequate water to meet the crop water requirements. It is also a need to ensure appropriate spacing between the dripline laterals to assure reasonable lateral irrigation uniformity for plant germination.   In this study, the program HYDRUS-2D was used to determine the wetting pattern above and laterally from a subsurface drip emitter of an SDI system, for three soils typically found in Southern California and Arizona, a Sandy Clay Loam (SCL), a Clay Loam (CL) and a Loam (L). The design and management conditions from an experimental alfalfa field with an SDI system located at Holtville CA were used and analyzed. The first irrigation design was with a drip line depth of placement of 30 cm and the second design with an installation depth of 50 cm. The two different irrigation management schemes utilized by the farmers and producers in that area were: one with a running time of six hours and a frequency of every three days and the second one with an irrigation running time of twenty-four hours with a frequency of seven days or irrigation every week.   After having carried out the analysis and studies of the irrigation designs and management schemes mentioned above, a new model with its corresponding management was proposed to meet the alfalfa water requirements under that particular field and weather conditions while we ensure a sufficiently dry soil surface at harvesting time for each soil case. This irrigation management includes twelve hours or irrigation every three days, for each of the three soils analyzed. It was found that the vertical rise of water above the emitters on the day of the cut, for our recommended SDI management was 26 cm, 29 cm, and 27 cm, with a moisture content at the soil surface of 14.9{\%}, 24{\%}, and 13{\%} for the SCL, CL, and L soils respectively. Then, through the utilization of classical soil mechanics theory, an analysis to calculate the increase in stress on soils at any depth due to a load on the surface from a conventional tractor used during harvest operations was made for the proposed SDI system. The results from the increase in stress were then used together with soil strength properties such as shear strength as a function of soil moisture content to determine the minimum allowable depth of placement of the drip line tubing to ensure that soil failure does not occur. The load increase from a 3,300-kg four-wheel tractor was found to be 0.59 kg/cm2 under a rear tire at 10 cm below the surface and 0.07 kg/cm2 at 70 cm below the surface.   To ensure that shearing failure does not occur, a stress analysis using Mohr's circle indicated that the soil moisture content at 10 cm below the surface should be no greater than 26.8{\%}, 32.7{\%}, and 27{\%} in the SCL, CL, and L soils respectively. The mimimum moisture content of 26.8{\%} occur at 10 cm above the drip line for a SCL soil, which means that the minimum depth placement to avoid failure would be 40 cm below the surface. A similar analysis for the CL and L yielded minimum installation depths of 35 cm and 40 cm respectively. This type of analysis is useful in determining the depth of placement of SDI drip line tubing to ensure adequate trafficability of soil irrigated with subsurface drip irrigation systems. An additional outcome of the modeling study was the determination of the lateral extent of the wetted zone which can be used to determine the appropriate lateral spacing between drip line tubing. Thus, to ensure adequate spatial coverage by a subsurface drip system, the maximum horizontal spacing should be of 80 cm for SCL and L soils and 90 cm in CL soils.},

abstract = {Microirrigation system is an efficient irrigation method that saves up to 60{\%} of water and nutrients. However, the huge investment for installation of modern microirrigation systems is beyond of many smallholder crop producers. Therefore, this study focuses to model and develop the capillary wick irrigation system for greenhouse crop production to address this issue. The results revealed on tested wick materials that the maximum capillary height and maximum water holding capacity were observed in cotton bonded non-woven wick material compared to other materials (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Water level, wick length, and pot size linearly affected the discharge of wick emitter in hanging and buried capillary wick irrigation system (CWIS). In this study, the discharge equations for wick emitter of hanging and buried CWIS were successfully developed. Comparison of calculated discharge using newly developed equation with actual measured discharge of buried wick for potted tomatoes in greenhouse proved the accuracy of the equation. The effects of evapotranspiration were also found linearly on discharge of wick emitter and the relation between emitter discharge, pot size and evapotranspiration were lead the development of wick discharge linear curve (WDLC). WDLC introduced to estimate the required discharge for potted crops under CWIS. Then, solver program was used to successfully simulate the wick discharge for different potted crops under a CWIS. Outcomes of the study can be beneficial for smallholder farmers for greenhouse crop production for adopting CWIS as low-cost and highly efficient microirrigation system.},

abstract = {Climate projection at local scale is one of the crucial challenges that affects the development of water management-related mitigation plans. Moreover, the currently available climate models do not directly simulate some of the hydro-climatic parameters (e.g., effective rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, irrigation requirements), which are of interest in irrigation sector. Modeling crop-water demands under changing climate involves several step-by-step approaches that are tedious and time-consuming for many water users. This study developed a water management tool, hereafter called Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS), for modeling water demand of rice irrigation schemes under climate change impacts. The CSDSS is a user-friendly interactive program consisting of three main modules integrated in MATLAB and a graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE). The model runs with ten Global Climate Models (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). It can generate several hydro-climatic parameters based on a daily water balance model, with input data from GCMs projections, crop, soil and field conditions. The model allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy water management. The generated outputs can be obtained through individual GCMs as well as through multi-models (ensemble) projection and can be converted into excel format for further analysis. The model was applied to evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand and other key hydro-climatic parameters in Tanjung Karang Rice Irrigation Scheme in Malaysia for the period 2010–2099 with reference to the baseline period of 1976–2005. The results show that irrigation water demand will increase during the off-season (January–June) but decrease during the main season (July–December) due to significant contribution from effective rainfall in the latter season. The CSDSS tool can be used for managing water resources under changing climate and would, therefore, be helpful in promoting appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies that can lead to more sustainable water use at farm level. Some future improvements of the tool, due to methodological limitations of the study, will however improve its performance.},

abstract = {Readily available nitrogen (N) sources such as ammonium nitrate with excessive irrigation present a potential hazard for the environment. The computer program Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) is a mechanistic model developed for rapid site-specific estimates of nitrate-nitrogen (NO sub(3) -N) moving below the root zone in agricultural crops and potantial impacts of NO sub(3) -N leaching into groundwater. In this study, the value of NLEAP was tested to simulate N uptake by crops and NO sub(3) -N leaching parameters in large lysimeters under the tomato crop. Three seedlings of tomato variety of H-2274 (Lycopersicum esculentum L.) were transplanted into each lysimeter. N fertilizer at the rate of 140 kg N ha super(-1) was sidedressed in two split applications, the first half as ammonium sulphate and the second half as ammonium nitrate. The lysimeters were irrigated based on programs of C 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.50, C referring to class A-Pan evaporation coefficients. Parameters such as leaching index (LI), annual leaching risk potential (ALRP), N available for leaching (NAL), amount of NO sub(3) -N leached (NL) and amount of N taken up by the crops (NU) were estimated using the NLEAP computer model. To test the ability of model to simulate N uptake and NL, measured values were compared with simulated values. Significant correlations, R super(2) = 0.92 and P {\textless} 0.03 for the first year and R super(2) = 0.86 and P {\textless} 0.06 for the second year, were found between measured and simulated values for crop N consumption, indicating that the NLEAP model adequately described crop N uptake under the varied irrigation programs using an optimal N fertilization program for the experimental site. Significant correlations, R super(2) = 0.96 and P {\textless} 0.01 for the first year and R super(2) = 0.97 and P {\textless} 0.01 for the second year, were also found between measured and simulated values of NL, indicating that the NLEAP model also adequately predicted NL under the varied irrigation programs. Therefore, this computer model can be useful to estimate the NO sub(3) -N moving beyond the root zone under conditions in which the present experiment was carried out. Also, the NLEAP-estimated NAL values and other parameters can also be used to improve N management practices and N fertilizer recommendations that will help to decrease the adverse effect of N fertilizer on groundwater quality and farm profitability.},

abstract = {Process-based crop models such as AquaCrop are useful for a variety of applications but must be accurately calibrated and validated. Sugar beet is an important crop that is grown in regions under water scarcity. The discrepancies and uncertainty in past published calibrations, together with important modifications in the program, deemed it necessary to conduct a study aimed at the calibration of AquaCrop (version 6.1) using the results of a single deficit irrigation experiment. The model was validated with additional data from eight farms differing in location, years, varieties, sowing dates, and irrigation. The overall performance of AquaCrop for simulating canopy cover, biomass, and final yield was accurate (RMSE = 11.39{\%}, 2.10 t ha−1, and 0.85 t ha−1, respectively). Once the model was properly calibrated and validated, a scenario analysis was carried out to assess the crop response in terms of yield and water productivity to different irrigation water allocations in the two main production areas of sugar beet in Spain (spring and autumn sowing). The results highlighted the potential of the model by showing the important impact of irrigation water allocation and sowing time on sugar beet production and its irrigation water productivity.},

The study revealed that none of the survival curves of E. coli and A. suum was best fitted with the log-linear model, indicating that the classical first-order kinetic approach is inadequate in many cases. The biphasic die-off model best described the die-off of E. coli on lettuce (kmax1 = 2.62 day−1 and kmax2 = 0.22 day−1) and cabbage (kmax1 = 1.06 day−1 and kmax2 = 0.53 day−1). The die-off of A. suum on lettuce was best described by the biphasic model (kmax1 = 0.48 day−1 and kmax2 = 0.01 day−1) and best described by log linear + tail (kmax = 0.44) on cabbage. A comparative health risk assessment associated with the consumption of lettuce showed significant underestimation of the number of days of irrigation cessation required to achieve E. coli O157:H7 and Ascaris tolerable annual infection risk when using biphasic die-off rates compared with other die-off rates. The study stresses the need to test different die-off models as inputs for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) particularly for interventions associated with health risk reduction.},

abstract = {A model and computer program were developed to calculate water application depth and uniformity coefficient for small spray nozzles mounted on a center-pivot irrigation system. The program requires two basic inputs. First, the experimental data for the static distribution pattern of the spray nozzle, including collection time, spacing between collection cups, cup opening radius, and volume of water collected in each cup at a specific pressure and height are required. Second, irrigation system inputs including spacing between spray nozzles, radius of distal end tower and moving velocity, distance of spray nozzle from the pivot, move stop cycle time, or cycle time, and percentage of moving time from the cycle time, or percentage of moving time are needed. The outputs are water application depth and uniformity coefficient. Experiments were conducted to validate the simulation for various moving velocities, spacing between spray nozzles, cycle times, and percentages of moving time. Results showed that the uniformity coefficient of water distribution was 98.4{\%} of the predicted coefficient and that by changing cycle time, or percentage of moving time, the uniformity coefficient was improved by as much as 14.2{\%}.},

abstract = {The area under irrigated corn has significantly increased in the Charente river basin during the last 10 years. Corn water requirements are maximum in the summer, the period with low water flows and highest environmental vulnerability. Periods of water shortage during which irrigation is temporarily forbidden occur frequently. To reduce water demand, specific water saving policies are required. This paper investigates irrigation management strategies at farm level during water shortages. A computer programme called IRMA is used to represent the farmer's decision making process. The model was calibrated and validated using information collected through a detailed monitoring of irrigation and farming practices of three representative farms during two irrigation seasons. The accuracy of the model was good; the difference between measured and simulated cumulative water volume used was slightly less than 8.5{\%}. Analysis of daily simulated water demand shows that farmers have adopted different strategies to deal with water shortages, depending on the physical and socio-economic characteristics of their farms. The application presented in this paper stresses the potential of the proposed approach, if used on a larger farm sample, to compare the expected impact of different water management policies on water demand and irrigation practices at the farm level.},

abstract = {The study case is situated in Calarasi County, Romania, near Danube river. The sprinkler irrigation arrangement serves the area of 1018.67 ha, useful, net irrigated area. The sprinkler irrigation arrangement comprises fixed irrigation equipment consisting of 16 central irrigation pivots equipped with nozzle ramps for water spray, the pivots are supplied with water through a network of underground pipes, pumping station, water source the Privalul Tinoasa channel fed from the Danube River The Privalul Tinoasa channel will be cleared and re-profiled, having the role of water accumulation basin that will ensure the aspiration for the designed pumping station. Numerical modelling was performed using the program MIKE11. MIKE 11 is a user-friendly, fully dynamic, one-dimensional modelling tool for the detailed analysis, design, management and operation of both simple and complex river and channel systems. With its exceptional flexibility, speed and user-friendly environment, MIKE 11 provides a complete and effective design environment for engineering, water resources, water quality management and planning applications. The Hydrodynamic (HD) module is the nucleus of the MIKE 11 modelling system and forms the basis for most modules including Flood Forecasting, Advection-Dispersion, Water Quality and Non-cohesive sediment transport modules. The MIKE 11 HD module solves the vertically integrated equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, i.e. the Saint-Venant equations. The input data are: area plan with location of cross sections; cross sections topographical data and roughness of river bed; flood discharge hydrograph. Advanced computational modules are included for a description of flow over hydraulic structures, including possibilities to describe the structure operation.},

@phdthesis{Prieto2006,
abstract = {The Rio Dulce Irrigation Project (PRD), with its irrigable area of 120000 hectares, is one of the most important irrigation systems in Argentina. It has contributed more than 40{\%} of the gross agriculture product of Santiago del Estero province for many years and supports the livelihoods of more than 50 {\%} of its population.Irrigation in the area of the Rio Dulce started before 1900, first through the spontaneous action of local settlers developing local canals for irrigation for local markets. However, political changes and new commercial possibilities since the beginning of the twentieth century brought a succession of public and private impulses to enlarge and modernize the irrigation system. The economic and political importance of the PRD made the system an 'ongoing' project of interventions by provincial and national politics.Irrigation first evolved in relation to the maximum area cultivable under the unregulated source of Rio Dulce water. Motivated by continuous conflicts between users and its own interventionist policy, the National Government planned its first structured intervention in irrigation during the 1940's. This presumed the development of physical infrastructure to improve water capture and conveyance, and a reorganization of irrigation operations to achieve the objective of maximizing production per unit of water (protective irrigation). While "modern" physical infrastructure was constructed in some parts of the system, the management of the system was never systematically reorganized. Administration continued under the responsibility of the provincial agency, but the area continued its "wild" evolution and operation.Then a second intervention in the area, the Rio Dulce Project (PRD) was planned as a joint effort of the National and Provincial government after construction of a reservoir by the Federal Government that started its operation in 1966. Its focus was on new water regulation technologies and a broader rural transformation that implied a complete "modernization package". This package included development of the water storage capacity, reallocation of water, direct involvement of a professional national agency in system administration, strong promotion of "modern" irrigation practices and full government extension support to irrigated agriculture production.This program was truncated by political reasons in 1973-1975 in its early stages, leaving - besides the reservoir - only a partially improved infrastructure for conveyance and distribution of water and a National Agency in charge of system operation, maintenance and management. Since then, the evolution of the project has been shaped first by a progressively unmotivated (in irrigation terms) national agency, and then by a provincial agency from 1992, but also by a heterogeneous group of users and general stakeholders and highly unpredictable incentives set by a changed political and economic context.Through political and technical negotiations, project representatives have been able to control different interests and threats that would be source of conflicts in many other areas. Large and small farmers, farmers with permanent water rights that do not crop and farmers that crop significant areas with only annual water rights have coexisted without serious conflicts for many years.The hypotheses behind this thesis are that the relatively conflict-free operational environment in PRD has been possible at a cost to provincial development, through an important underutilization of the irrigation scheme that also involves low water productivity, inefficient and ineffective use of suitable land, loss of economic opportunities, and a high dependency of small farmers on populist policies of both National and Provincial Governments.This thesis documents the evolution of this in-system diversity and the sociotechnical arrangements, contestation and adaptation that allowed water to keep flowing effectively despite a complex and often chaotic history of public intervention and technological changes. It also examines the motivations and strategies of farmers and agencies, the output (performance) of the system from different points of view, and the 'room for manoevre' to improve irrigation performance of the system.Chapters 2, 3 and 4 provide the reader with an overview not only of the physical and technical context of the PRD by the time of this research (1999-2001), but also of the social dynamics characterized by a weak role of the state in irrigation activities in particular and development initiatives in general.With the main objective to demonstrate how social actors, political and economic context and natural environment have shaped evolution of designed physical systems, Chapter 2 reviews the social construction of irrigation in the area, since beginning of the twentieth century. It describes the changing roles and strategies of the main actors - a heterogeneous set of users with different power and capacities to mobilize resources, the irrigation agencies as independent entities and the provincial and national governments. The historical analysis was useful to understand specific features and institutions present in the PRD that have their roots in early stages of irrigation development in the area and in primitive irrigation practices. In particular Chapter 2 shows that the characteristic social structure of the PRD was made up by large and small farmers. This signified socially a definitive exclusion of many people from the benefits of irrigation and physically the formation of a mosaic pattern of water righted and not water righted areas. The important institution to control head-tailender problems that tailenders irrigate first were established in the initial period without any significant role of the state.The evolution of farmer participation and farmers' organization discourses also shown in Chapter 2 demonstrates that as water availability, water control by physical infrastructure and organization of water distribution improved, at the same time farmers' participation, mobilization and their commitment with water issues decreased from self-mobilization in early stages to passive participation by the end of the 1990s. In parallel with this change, the main topics of debate by farmers' organizations changed from the need for equitable access of small farmers to water to the technocratic demand for better infrastructure.Chapter 3 also makes an historical overview of the political process of water allocation. It shows that like the infrastructure, water allocation in PRD evolved without a planned project by Federal or Provincial Governments since the beginning of irrigation to the present situation. The chapter highlights how, within this unplanned context, allocation of water has been a continuous contested process across the 100 year period of irrigation development in the area. There has been a negotiated social process subject to political decisions, but shaped by social actors with changing roles and adaptive strategies that reflect the changing context but have a main objective to get as much water as they can.Within these changing roles, a key determinant for the future development of irrigation was the shared political control over water allocation exercised in the initial period by the Provincial Government in La Cuarteada irrigation system and by the owners of private acequias. Most of the people excluded in this period were not seriously reconsidered during either of the two state interventions, that had a common criteria of acknowledging existing water rights up to a maximum area (400 ha) and limited new rights to a maximum area of 50 ha.Regarding adaptive action, one relevant trend for the development of irrigation has been the generalized adoption by users of a strategy to get water rights for more area than that cropped. This was a response to the positivist technical decisions of the provincial agency, in this case reducing the volume allocated per unit of land during the first important state intervention in the 1950's. This action "kidnapped" water by existing users, which could not be permanently released until present times. It provoked the emergence of PRETA's - a sort of "water banking" system managed by the agency to re-allocate annually any surplus of water. PRETAs have persisted in time and are becoming a permanent institution for water allocation in the area due to their high functionality for the agency and for large farmers- the sub-group of users demanding more water in the last 20 years.Chapter 4 closes the series of descriptive chapters, describing briefly the main production systems present in the PRE) area, the agrarian structure based on official information, the cropping patterns and main agriculture outputs, and crop yields and water productivity based on mean production prices at market places. Eight production systems has been identified in PRD are, however for this research they have been re grouped in two types, the small and familiar production systems and the entrepreneur production systems.Chapter 5 is the first of the 5 empirical chapters. It describes the infrastructure and water management practices for operation and water distribution in the main system (upstream of tertiary units). Also it presents the main outputs (performance) and the comparative analysis of performance the indicators for the whole PRD system and each of its 8 main secondary canals. The infrastructure for physical water control includes different types of canals, division structures and water measurement structures. It is not the output of a planned intervention but the result of the different irrigation concepts behind the two main modernization interventions. Different design criteria were applied during the last intervention (PRD) and its incomplete implementation. However from the operational point of view the PRD is a gated operated system with diversion structures including gated offtakes and gated cross regulators.Despite the official fixed rotational full supply water delivery schedule to tertiary and farm units, many features required for a responsive "modern" management of irrigation systems are present. Four independent district offices operate the system from secondary canals downstream; a very high water delivery capacity of most canals confers a relatively high online storage capacity; communications among the operational units and even among field staff is excellent, operators live in the area they control, the number of turnouts field officials have to operate is low, their mobility is good and accessibility of turnouts is permanent even in the rainy season. In fact the monthly pattern of canal discharges presented in the chapter indicates that the water delivery schedule has moved away from the official schedule to a more responsive schedule to water demand dictated by the cropping patterns and irrigation practices of users.Regarding water supply and irrigation adequacy on an annual basis, results support the statement that the PRD is "a wet irrigation system in a dry area". Mean annual RWS for the Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project 3 years period studied was 1,9, and 2,4 for a longer 20 years period, while RIS were 2,3 and 3,7 for the same periods. Water supply and irrigation adequacy were also high for all of the 8 main secondary canals. However there were rather large differences between them with mean annual RWS and RIS ranging from 1,2 to 2,8 and 1,2 to 4.2 for the period studied.There is no "tail" effect among the 6 secondary that take water directly from the Matriz canals. However, the two most downstream secondary canals (Sud II and Simbolar) that are fed indirectly from a large canal (Jume Esquina) designed to transfer water from Rio Dulce to Rio Salado showed the lowest values of both indicators. Inter-annual variations were high and daily discharge fluctuations increased along the main canal, suggesting a poorly planned and executed delivery operation, and a mismanagement of diversion structures that have a hydraulic flexibility lower than 1.Monthly analysis of water supply and adequacy indicators revealed particular features of the local irrigation practices hidden in the annual analysis, that have important consequences for the performance of the system. There is a high concentration of water use in the final months of the dry season (from July to September) with RWS and RIS that reached values as high as 15 or 20 in some canals, and a very low use of irrigation during the rainy season with RWS and RIS close to or even lower than 1. These results, that reflect the predominant cropping pattern and the traditional irrigation practices at farm level, justify the characterization of the PRD as "a wet system in a dry area with dry crops in the wet season".The empirical Chapters 6 to 9 deal with the study of the 4 sampled tertiary units selected as representative of the most common physical characteristics found within PRD.Chapter 6 presents the case of the JS tertiary unit, a modernized tertiary unit with modern hydraulic water control and old small farmers' irrigation practices. The modernization package applied in this redesigned tertiary unit included a reduction of its size, a complete modernization of irrigation structures, control delivery discharge and largely improved farmers water acquisition so this was no longer a restrictive production factor but did not change any of the irrigation practices at farm level. The main conclusion is that this modernization package applied and did not reverse the impoverishment process that other political and economical factors imposed over the type of production systems predominating in the area (the number of farmers decreased almost 60{\%}, and there has been a concentration of land and water by more successful local farmers)Furthermore, the water management at the tertiary unit was reshaped by the users to adapt it to their preferences that include a few heavy irrigation gifts per year. The mean gross irrigation depth per irrigation event has risen to 230 mm (2,6 times greater than the gross official irrigation depth of 90 mm) by increasing up delivery duration to three times the official 50 min/ha. This is possible because the irrigated area per turn is far below the water righted area but also lower than the actual cropped area. In spite of the high use of water in individual events, average annual water use by JS farmers is not more than 60{\%} of the volume allocated to them. This is due to a reduction of cropped area to 57{\%} of the water righted area, and the afore-mentioned farmers' irrigation strategies including few irrigations events in most crops.Chapter 7 analyzes the case of Bl-TTS, a tertiary unit in a newly developed irrigated sub-area created by the PRD, where small farmers from other areas were re-settled in 25 ha parcels. The modernization package, as in JS, included a modern design of tertiary units, irrigation structures and in this case also a modern design of irrigation facilities at farm level. The other main difference from other areas is the implementation of an arranged rotational water delivery schedule. The findings in this area, as in JS, highlight that modernization has not improved water management at either tertiary level or at farm level and it was not able to reverse the impoverishment of the farmers who gradually reduced their cropped area to acreage similar to what they used to crop in their original plots.The modern irrigation delivery package implemented in Bl-TTS was less reshaped by users than elsewhere, because the proposed water delivery schedule and its 'soft' application by field officials brings them flexibility to implement their irrigation preferences. The mean annual water use of 8620 m3 /ha was only 90{\%} of the water allocated to them, but the highest among study areas. On average Bl-TTS farmers used only three irrigation events, mainly concentrated in times of pre-seeding of their predominant vegetable crops. The mean discharge delivered, 398 1/s, was 30{\%} greater than the official 300 1/s. Although there was variation during the year and between farms, mean time delivery duration at farm level was 3,3 hr/ha, the greatest among the study areas, and almost 4 times greater than official 50 min/ha. High discharges and long delivery times led to mean gross irrigation depth (327 mm) to be on average 3,6 times greater than the official gross irrigation depth of 90 mm and obviously the greatest amongst the areas studied.The RS tertiary unit case presented in Chapter 8 is a representative case of modernization of water distribution of an old acequia, under control of a heterogeneous group of users. The main differences with the previous cases are that the modernization package applied to this area only included a change in water delivery schedule, and a minimum improvement of delivery structures. There was heterogeneity of production systems coexisting in the area - that ranged from small-family holdings to very large entrepreneur farmers - and a large presence of PRETAs that represented 30{\%} of the Total Water Righted Area in the RS unit in the 2000/2001 growing season.The main finding in this case showed that, as in previous cases RS farmers have had capabilities to reshape official irrigation schedules to make water distribution more flexible and able to suit their real needs. Actually farmers' irrigation practices are not different from those of farmers in other areas and they do not change in relation to type of farmer or water right status. They present the same contradictory features from the water exploitation perspective. Irrigation strategies were mainly based on high irrigation for pre-seeding and few applications during crop growth, resembling protective irrigation practices. Water is not treated as a scarce resource during water application and, as elsewhere, is a substitute for other less available resources (including capital for land levelling, manpower for a better control of water application, and capital for infrastructural change to control endemic reduction of discharges at the tail of the water course).Delivery duration in this area was on average 1,8 to 2 times higher than the officially scheduled mean delivery discharge, 487 1/s, the second highest of the study cases. This results in a mean irrigation depth of 291 mm/turn, 2,7 times greater than the official 90 mm/turn. There were no substantial differences in irrigation practice and water use between different types of farmer, or between different positions along the water course (head and tail) and type of water rights. This makes it clear that PRETAs did not lead to a better use of water.Modernization was also not able in this case to reverse the impoverishment of small farmers who were negatively affected by neo-liberal policies and lack of official support, and not from any struggle around water. The fact that most of them have abandoned agricultural Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project activities has gave room for medium and large farmers to increase their areas, and led to a more intensive concentration of land and water in this area than elsewhere.Chapter 9 presents the SMFN case. It is representative of entrepreneurial water use in an unmodernised unit. The area with permanent water rights is similar to that of the previous cases studied, but unlike them only 10 large farmers held this. The mosaic pattern of irrigated and non-irrigated areas is still present, since in spite of the large area under permanent water rights, this actually only covers 37{\%} of the gross command area. The availability of land, complemented by the diversified entrepreneurial production systems with high capacity to respond to market incentives, has made the use of PRETAs a frequent tool by which these farmers respond to market demand. These factors have supported steady growth of the irrigated area that reached 1020 ha in the 2000/2001 growing season.The study showed that this tertiary unit functions more closely than others to official criteria in some aspects. Average annual water used ranges between 80 and 90{\%} of the volume allocated and, unlike other units; cropped area remained close to water righted area. Yet still the users, who apply more water control at farm level, were able to reshape many aspects of water delivery to make it more flexible and highly responsive to their demand.The official farm irrigation order was mostly the exception rather than the rule in almost all the 20 irrigation turns analyzed. In spite of being one of the comuneros at the tail of San Martin secondary canal, discharges delivered during the research period were 1.9 times greater than the official planned discharge, the largest of the 4 studied areas. The delivery duration varied between irrigation turns and farms, but in most cases it was 20- 70{\%} greater than the official duration, yielding a mean annual delivery 1,5 higher than the official one - but the lowest among the study areas. The mean irrigation depth per turn was 257 mm, the second lowest in this study, but still similar to those applied in other areas and almost triple the official gross irrigation depth.Chapter 10 makes a comparative analysis of the findings on the tertiary units studied and looks for explanatory ideas and causal relations. The analysis based on the calculated performance indicators presents the views of higher level stakeholders on the management of the PRD and allowed many and varied conclusions.Modern irrigation infrastructure, high water availability and responsive management of the main system to users needs have not been sufficient to guarantee economic development, and/or simply overcome negative effects of open market policies for small farmers. Modern facilities were also not a sufficient condition to improve water management at farm level. Most farmers, including those who applied modern agricultural technologies in their crop production, continue with traditional irrigation practices.Despite the modern irrigation facilities, including the Rio Hondo reservoir, which assured a monthly irrigation water supply, due the fact that irrigation practices at farm level have not changed too much, farmers do not use more than 30{\%} of the available irrigation turns and basin irrigation is the application method of all of them.The comparative analysis also showed that in all cases there is a high lack of uniformity in most parameters of water distribution: the frequency of irrigation turns is very different from the official; irrigation order is frequently changed within the tertiary units especially by administradores; the mean delivery duration and delivery discharge are 2,2 hrs and 396 1/s with a variation coefficient of 43 and 41 {\%} respectively while the mean irrigation depth per irrigation event is 275 mm and its variation coefficient only 15{\%} due a high compensation of delivery duration and discharge. Due to the low number of irrigations during the year, the mean annual water use (781 mm/year) remained below the water-righted volume, despite the heavy individual applications.Regarding water supply and irrigation adequacy, results from the 4 units studied showed a similar annual and monthly pattern to the whole project and secondary canals. There are variations between the studied units but the RWS and RIS performance indicators indicate that all of them are, on an annual base well-wetted - irrespective of infrastructure, production systems, predominant crops and homogeneity of users. Monthly results were also similar to upstream sections of the system; with high peak of water use from July to November confirms the high influence of irrigation practices on secondary canals (subsystems) and system performance.Chapter 11 explores alternative approaches to irrigation performance assessment from agency officials and user visions, and it enquires into the environmental impact of the PRD's outputs on system (mainly soil salinity) and on river basin water use. Alternative assessments of system performance from agency and user perspective revealed their high satisfaction with outputs, and different understandings of some of the classic assessment parameters such as adequacy, timeliness and equity.The present and former irrigation agencies have used the number of user complaints as a unique, explicit and powerful indicator to internally assess their performance, and to keep them as low as possible as their main targets. This has led them to be highly responsive to users, incorporating flexibility in water delivery - a core element of the modern irrigation system operation - as a logical consequence of this pragmatic management and not as a reflexive decision based on a planned intervention. At the same time this responsive behaviour of the agency gives users strong opportunities to influence the way water is delivered in the system. In practice the relatively high water availability in relation to the cropped area has been a key determinant to achieve these goals (and support the high satisfaction with the agency) in spite of their low technical skills.Farmers' satisfaction with system performance is also high. It is highly related to the full coverage of their low water requirements stemming from their water management practices rooted in "protective" irrigation principles and their preferences in terms of the way water is delivered to their farms.In relation to salinity hazard the PRD has been synonymous with secondary salinity in the Argentinean irrigation sector. That the local irrigation practices characterized by a few but concentrated heavy water applications produce a rise of water table and an active process of secondary salinization would not be a surprising conclusion. However the particular feature in the PRD is that the mosaic pattern of irrigated and non-irrigated lands, a product of negotiated water allocation process, gave the non-irrigated area (that is almost 60{\%} of the command area) the unplanned role of being the salt sink within the PRD. Therefore this process affecting non-irrigated area within the command area has also increased the negative effects on these landowners also affected by the early exclusion from irrigation, and represents a high cost for provincial development.At the same time, the use of water by natural vegetation over the large areas of non-irrigated land greatly increases the non-beneficial use of irrigation water and reduces to a minimum the expected return flow, and is making the PRD a closed irrigation system. This feature should 2 70 Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project be seriously considered in future interventions and in planning water management at basin level.Chapter 12 closes the thesis with a review of the questions and a framework developed in this research study and its main conclusions, and gives a brief discussion of topics that should be in the agenda for any new cycle of modernization in the PRD.The conclusions cover a large number of topics but highlight the pragmatic character of the evolutionary path of PRD; the de-coding of modernization interventions by local actors to provide their real requirements, including persistence of traditional practices in modernized areas; and the adaptive management of the irrigation agency to become close to the service approach of the "modernization" package without use of any of the proposed performance indicators proposed by the literature. Also, it notes the usefulness of comparative indicators used on monthly base to unmask the diversity within large irrigation systems. At the larger scale, the study stresses the changing role that irrigation has had in the area as a social force for development, and as a cause of social exclusion and social differentiation.The chapter stresses that the PRD case should be useful to show that a new round of modernization of PRD - and any other large irrigation system - should find new ways to work and provide differentiated services for this diversity. Therefore we should necessarily think of the next round of modernization as UNA TAREA DE TODOS (A COLLECTIVE ACTION).Alternate abstract:Het "Rio Dulce Irrigatie Project" (PRD), met 120.000 hectare irrigeerbare landbouw, is een van de meest belangrijke irrigatiesystemen in Argentinie. Het heeft al vele jaren meer dan 40{\%} bijgedragen aan de bruto landbouwproductie van de provincie Santiago del Estero en ondersteunt in het levensonderhoud van meer dan 50{\%} van de bevolking.In het gebied van de Rio Dulce ('zoet water rivier') is irrigatie al voor 1900 begonnen, in eerste instantie door spontane acties van lokale kolonisten die kleine kanalen voor irrigatie aanlegden voor de lokale markt. Echter, in het begin van de 20ste  eeuw brachten politieke veranderingen en nieuwe commerciele mogelijkheden een groot aantal publieke en private impulsen om het irrigatiesysteem te vergroten en te moderniseren. Het economische en politieke belang van de PRD maakt het systeem een doorlopend project van interventies door de provinciale en nationale politiek.Irrigatie ontwikkelde tot het maximale bebouwbare gebied onder een niet-gereguleerde afname van water uit de Rio Dulce. De nationale overheid plande, gemotiveerd door een doorlopende strijd tussen watergebruikers en haar interventiepolitiek, de eerste gestructureerde interventie in irrigatie gedurende de jaren 1940. Deze interventie hield in dat de fysieke infrastructuur werd ontwikkeld met doel zoveel mogelijk water van de rivier af te tappen en te transporteren. Daarnaast werd het irrigatie beheer gereorganiseerd met als doel een maximale opbrengst te verkrijgen per eenheid water (beschermende irrigatie). In sommige delen van het irrigatiesysteem werd "moderne" fysieke infrastructuur aangelegd, maar het beheer van het systeem werd nooit systematisch gereorganiseerd. Het systeem viel nog steeds onder de administratie van de provincie, en het irrigatiegebied ging verder met de "wildgroei" in ontwikkeling en beheer.Een tweede reorganisatie in het gebied van het "Rio Dulce Irrigatie Project" werd gepland door de nationale en provinciale overheid na de aanleg door de federale overheid van een dam en stuwmeer in 1966. Aandachtspunten van deze interventie waren gericht op nieuwe waterregelende technologieen en een bredere rurale transformatie dat werd gezien als een geheel 'modernisatie pakket'. Dit pakket bevatte verdere ontwikkeling van wateropslagcapaciteit, herverdeling van water, directe betrokkenheid van een professionele nationale instantie voor het systeembeheer, sterke promotie van 'moderne' irrigatiepraktijken en volledige ondersteuning door overheidsvoorlichting aan ge'irrigeerde landbouwproductie.Vanwege politieke redenen tussen 1973 en 1975 werd dit programma in een vroeg stadium afgebroken. Naast het aangelegde stuwmeer was er slechts een gedeeltelijk verbeterde infrastructuur voor watertransport en -verdeling en een nationale instantie die het systeem beheerde, onderhield en te werk stelde. Vanaf die tijd wordt de ontwikkeling van het project gekenmerkt door een steeds minder gemotiveerde (wat betreft irrigatie beheer) nationale instantie - vervolgens vanaf 1992 een provinciale instantie -, maar ook door een zeer wijd verspreide groep water gebruikers en algemene belangenhouders en hoogst onvoorspelbare prikkels vanuit een veranderende politiek en economisch klimaat.Projectvertegenwoordigers waren in staat om, door politieke en technische onderhandelingen, de verschillen in belangen en dreigingen te controleren die een bron van conflict waren in andere gebieden. Grote en kleine boeren, boeren met permanente waterrechten maar zonder landbouwproductie en boeren die produceerden met slechts jaarlijks toegewezen Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Duke Irrigation Project waterrechten hebben vele jaren samen in een irrigatiesysteem geleefd zonder noemenswaardige botsingen.De hypothese van dit proefschrift is dat het relatieve gebrek aan botsingen in de operationele omgeving van het PRD alleen mogelijk zijn geweest ten koste van provinciale ontwikkeling door een belangrijk ondergebruik van het irrigatiesysteem, resulterend in lage waterproductiviteit, inefficient en ineffectief gebruik van vruchtbaar land, verlies van economische mogelijkheden, en een grote afhankelijkheid van kleine boeren op populistische politiek van zowel de nationale als de provinciale overheid.Dit proefschrift documenteert de ontwikkeling van de diversiviteit in het systeem, de sociaaltechnische regelingen, aanvechtingen en aanpassingen die er aan toe hebben gedragen dat water effectief bleef stromen, ondanks een complexe en vaak chaotische geschiedenis van publieke interventies en technologische veranderingen. Het bestudeert ook de motivatie en strategieen van boeren en instanties, de productie (prestatie) van het systeem vanuit verschillende invalshoeken, en de graad van vrijheid om de irrigatieproductie van het systeem te verbeteren.Hoofdstukken 2, 3 en 4 verschaffen de lezer een overzicht van niet alleen de fysieke en technische context van het PRD voor de periode van dit onderzoek (1999-2001), maar ook de sociale dynamiek die gekarakteriseerd wordt door een zwakke rol van de overheid in irrigatieactiviteiten in het bijzonder en ontwikkelingsinitiatieven in het algemeen.Hoofdstuk 2 neemt de sociale constructie van irrigatie in het gebied in ogenschouw vanaf het begin van de 20ste  eeuw, met als belangrijkste doel om aan te tonen hoe sociale spelers, politieke en economische context en natuurlijke omgeving de ontwikkeling van een bestaand fysiek systeem hebben gevormd. Het beschrijft de veranderende rol en strategie van de belangrijkste spelers - een wijd verspreide groep watergebruikers met verschillende invloeden en capaciteiten om middelen te mobiliseren, de irrigatieinstanties als onafhankelijke eenheden en de provinciale en nationale overheden. Deze historische analyse helpt om specifieke kenmerken en instituten te begrijpen die zich binnen het PRD bevinden en hun wortels hebben in het vroege stadium van irrigatieontwikkeling en primitieve irrigatiepraktijken in het gebied. Zeer van belang in hoofdstuk 2 is dat de karakteristieke sociale structuur van het PRD bestond uit zowel kleine als grote boeren. Door deze tweedeling ontstond er fysiek gezien binnen het PRD een mosaicpatroon van velden met en zonder irrigatie rechten. Sociaal gezien ontstond er daardoor ook voor velen een uitsluiting van de voordelen van irrigatie. Het klassieke 'head-tail' probleem in irrigatie, waarbij velden aan het begin van een irrigatiekanaal betere toegang tot water hebben dan de velden aan het eind van een kanaal, werd al vroeg opgelost door het principe "tailenders irrigate first" (velden aan het eind van het kanaal krijgen als eerste de beurt om te irrigeren). Dit principe werd toegepast zonder noemenswaardige rol van de overheid.De ontwikkeling van boerenparticipatie en verhandelingen van boerenorganisaties, ook beschreven in hoofdstuk 2, laat zien dat wanneer waterbeschikbaarheid, controle over water door fysieke infrastructuur en de organisatie van water verdeling verbetert, tegelijk ook de boerenparticipatie, mobilisatie en hun betrokkenheid bij watergerelateerde onderwerpen vermindert, veranderend van zelf-mobiliserend in de eerdere periodes tot passieve participatie tegen het einde van de jaren '90. Parallel aan deze processen ontstond er een verandering van discussieonderwerpen door boerenorganisaties, namelijk van de noodzaak voor een rechtvaardigere toegang tot water voor kleine boeren naar de technokratische vraag om een betere infrastruktuur.Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een historische beschrijving van het politieke proces van waterverdeling. Het toont aan dat, net als de infrastruktuur, waterverdeling binnen het PRD ontwikkelde zonder planning van de nationale of provinciale overheid in de gehele periode tussen het begin van irrigatie en de huidige situatie. Het hoofdstuk belicht hoe, zonder planning, waterverdeling is een continue bevochten proces gedurende de 100 jaar van irrigatieontwikkeling in het gebied. Het sociale proces van onderhandelingen werd gestimuleerd door politieke besluiten, maar werd beheerst door sociale spelers met veranderende rollen en aanpassende strategieen die de veranderende context weergaven, maar altijd gericht waren op het verkrijgen van zoveel mogelijk water.Binnen alle veranderingen bleef de politieke controle over waterverdeling een belangrijke factor voor de toekomstige ontwikkelingen van irrigatie. Deze controle werd in het begin uitgeoefend door de provinciale overheid in het Cuarteada irrigatie systeem, en door de eigenaren van private veldkanalen (acequias). De meeste boeren die tijdens deze periode geen waterrechten ontvingen werden ook in een later stadium, tijdens een van de twee overheidsinterventies niet serieus heroverwogen. Deze interventies hadden een gedeeld criterium waarin bestaande waterrechten tot een maximum van 400 hectare werden erkend, en een beperkt aantal nieuwe waterrechten werden toegekend tot een maximum van 50 hectare.Een relevante trend in de irrigatieontwikkeling en goed voorbeeld van aanpassend gedrag is de algemeen gebruikte strategic van watergebruikers om waterrechten te verkrijgen voor een groter areaal dan wat wordt bebouwd. Dit ontstond als reactie op een bepaalde technische beslissing van het provinciale instituut, in dit geval tijdens de eerste belangrijke overheidsinventie in de 50'er jaren om het volume toebedeelde water per eenheid land te verlagen. Bestaande gebruikers 'ontvoerden' water met dit gedrag en tot recent was het water nog niet vrij beschikbaar. Het veroorzaakte de verschijning van PRETA's - een soort "water bank" systeem dat wordt beheerd door het instituut om jaarlijks het overschot van water te herverdelen. PRETA's volhardde in de tijd en zijn een permanent instituut voor waterherverdeling aan het worden in het gebied, omdat ze zeer functioneel zijn voor het provinciale instituut en voor grote boeren - de subgroep van watergebruikers die in de afgelopen 20 jaar om meer water hebben gevraagd.Hoofdstuk 4 is het laatste in de serie van beschrijvende hoofdstukken. Het beschrijft kort de belangrijkste productiesystemen die aanwezig zijn binnen de PRD, de agrarische structuur gebaseerd op officiele informatie, de gewaspatronen en belangrijkste landbouwprodukten, en gewasopbrengsten en waterproductiviteit gebaseerd op gemiddelde productieprijzen op de markt. Acht productiesystemen worden gei'dentificeerd in het gebied van de PRD, maar zijn voor dit onderzoek hergroepeerd in twee typen, de kleine en familie productiesystemen en de grotere ondernemingsproductiesystemen.Hoofdstuk 5 is het eerste van vijf empirische hoofdstukken. Het beschrijft de infrastruktuur en waterbeheersmaatregelen voor dagelijks gebruik en waterverdeling in het hoofdsysteem (bovenstrooms van de tertiare eenheden). Het toont ook de belangrijkste productie (prestatie) en de vergelijkende analyse van prestatie indicatoren voor het gehele PRD systeem en elk van haar acht belangrijkste secondaire kanalen. De infrastructuur voor fysieke watercontrole bevat verschillende types kanalen, verdeel- en meetwerken. Dit is niet het gevolg van  Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project georganiseerde interventies, maar het resultaat van verschillende irrigatieconcepten die gebruikt werden tijdens de twee modernisatieinterventies. Verschillende ontwerpcriteria werden toegepast tijdens de laatste interventie en de (incomplete) implementatie. Echter, vanuit een beheersstandpunt gezien is het PRD een 'gate' systeem met verdeelwerken dat 'gate' aftakkingen en 'gate' kruisregelaars bevat.Ondanks dat officieel een vast rotatiesysteem voor volledige waterlevering aan tertiare en farm eenheden bestaat, zijn veel onderdelen die nodig zijn voor een flexibel 'modern' irrigatiebeheer wel aanwezig. Vier onafhankelijke districtkantoren beheren het systeem vanaf het secundaire niveau; een erg hoge waterleveringscapaciteit van de meeste kanalen betekent dat een relatief hoge opslagcapaciteit van water aanwezig is; er is een zeer goede communicatie tussen het operationele personeel en zelfs tussen het veldpersoneel; operationeel personeel woont in het gebied dat ze controleren, er is een relatief kleine hoeveel inlaten die veldwerkers hoeven te beheren, ze zijn erg mobiel en de toegang tot de inlaten is goed, zelfs tijdens de natte periode. Het maandelijkse patroon van kanaaldebieten dat in dit hoofdstuk wordt besproken geeft in feite aan dat het waterleveringsschema veranderd is van het officiele patroon naar een meer flexibel schema dat meer vraaggericht gestuurd wordt door de gewaspatronen en irrigatiemethoden van de gebruikers.Als de waterbeschikbaarheid en irrigatienauwkeurigheid op een jaarlijks interval wordt geevalueerd kan verklaard worden dat de PRD "een nat systeem in een droog gebied' is. De gemiddelde jaarlijkse indicator 'relatieve water beschikbaarheid' (RWS) voor de 3 jaren van deze studie was 1,9, en een 20 jarig gemiddelde geeft een waarde van 2,4. The indicator 'relatieve irrigatiewater beschikbaarheid' (RIS) was respectivevelijk 2,3 en 3,7 voor deze twee perioden. Waterbeschikbaarheid en irrigatienauwkeurigheid waren ook hoog voor alle 8 belangrijkste secondaire kanalen. Er waren echter grote verschillen onderling, met de gemiddelde jaarlijkse RWS varierend tussen 1,2 en 2,8 en de gemiddelde jaarlijkse RIS varierend tussen 1,2 en 4,2 for de bestudeerde periode.Er is geen "tail" effect (minder water aan het einde van het kanaal) bij de zes kanalen die hun water direct betrekken van het hoofdkanaal Matriz. Echter, de twee meest benedenstroomse secundaire kanalen (Sud II en Simbolar) die indirect vanuit een groot kanaal gevoed worden (Jume Esquina), dat ontworpen was om water te transporteren tussen de Rio Dulce en de Rio Salado, lieten de laagste waarden van de twee indicatoren zien. Variaties binnen het jaar waren hoog en dagelijkse debietfluctuaties nemen toe langs het hoofdkanaal, wat een indicatie is van slecht gepland en uitgevoerd leveringsbeheer. Slecht beheer van verdeelweken lijkt ook voor te komen, met hydraulische flexibiliteitswaarden van minder dan 1.Maandelijkse analyses van de waterbeschikbaarheid en irrigatienauwkeurigheid tonen een aantal speciale eigenschappen van lokale irrigatiemethoden die verborgen blijven in de jaarlijkse analyse, maar die een belangrijke invloed hebben op de irrigatieprestatie van het systeem. In de laatste maanden van het droge seizoen (van Juli tot en met September) is er een hoge dichtheid van watergebruik, met RWS en RIS indicaties van 15 of zelfs 20 in sommige kanalen. Tijdens de natte periode is er weinig gebruik van irrigatie met RWS en RIS waarden in de buurt van, en soms lager dan 1. Deze resultaten, die een reflectie zijn van het belangrijkste gewaspatroon en de traditionele irrigatiemethoden op het boerenbedrijf, ondersteunen de stelling dat het PRD een "nat systeem in een droog gebied met een droog gewas in het natte seizoen" is.De empirische hoofdstukken 6 tot en met 9 behandelen de studie van vier in detail bestudeerde tertiaire eenheden, die geselecteerd zijn als representatief voor de meest algemene fysieke karakteristieken die in het PRD gevonden kunnen worden.Hoofdstuk 6 behandelt het geval van de JS tertiaire eenheid. Dit is een gemoderniseerde tertiaire eenheid met moderne hydraulische waterwerken en oude kleinschalige irrigatiemethoden. Het modernisatiepakket dat toegepast werd in deze herontworpen eenheid bevatte een vermindering van het areaal, een komplete vernieuwing van de irrigatiewerken, gecontroleerde leveringsdebieten en grotendeels verbeterde wateraanvragen door de boeren. Dit was daardoor niet langer de beperkende productiefactor, maar veranderde niets aan de bestaande irrigatiemethoden op het niveau van het boerenbedrijf. De belangrijkste conclusie is dat dit modernisatiepakket werd toegepast, zonder dat dit het verarmingsproces kon keren dat door politieke en economische factoren werd veroorzaakt voor het belangrijkste productiesysteem in het gebied (het aantal boeren nam met bijna 60{\%} af, en de meer succesvolle lokale boeren konden land en water aan hun bedrijf toevoegen).Het waterbeheer op tertiair niveau werd door de watergebruikers aangepast naar hun voorkeur voor een klein aantal grote hoeveelheden water per irrigatiebeurt. De gemiddelde bruto waterdiepte per irrigatiebeurt is verhoogd naar 230 mm (2,6 keer hoger dan de officiele bruto irrigatiediepte van 90 mm) door middel van een verlenging van de leveringstijd van drie keer de officiele leveringstijd van 50 minuten per hectare. Dit is alleen mogelijk omdat het bevloeide areaal per irrigatiebeurt kleiner is dan het areaal waar waterrechten voor bestaan, en zelfs kleiner dan het werkelijk bebouwde areaal. Ondanks het hoge watergebruik per individuele irrigatiebeurt bedraagt het gemiddelde jaarlijkse waterverbruik in de JS eenheid niet meer dan 60{\%} van het totaal toegewezen volume. Dit hangt onder andere samen met een verkleining van het bebouwde areaal tot 57{\%} van het areaal waar waterrechten voor bestaan, en de bovengenoemde irrigatiestrategie om weinig irrigatiebeurten te gebruiken in de meeste gewassen.Hoofdstuk 7 analyseert het geval van Bl-TTS, een tertiaire eenheid in een nieuw ontwikkeld irrigatie sub-gebied, ontwikkeld binnen het PRD waar kleine boeren van andere gebieden werden herplaatst op 25 ha percelen. Het modernisatiepakket, gelijk aan het JS gebied, bevatte een modern ontwerp van tertiaire eenheden, irrigatiewerken en in dit geval ook een modern ontwerp van de irrigatiefaciliteiten op het veldniveau. Het andere belangrijkere verschil met andere gebieden is dat een van te voren vastgelegde irrigatierotatie werd gei'mplementeerd. De resultaten van dit gebied, net als in JS, tonen dat modernisatie het waterbeheer op tertiair niveau of veldniveau niet heeft verbeterd. Het was ook niet in staat om de verarming van de boeren te keren. Deze boeren keerden, door een verkleining van het bebouwde areaal, langzaam terug naar het areaal dat ze verbouwden op hun originele locatie voor herplaatsing.Het moderne waterleveringspakket dat gei'mplementeerd werd in Bl-TSS werd minder hervor/wc/ door de gebruikers dan elders, omdat het voorgestelde waterleveringsschema en de 'zachte' aanpak door veldwerkers hen al de flexibiliteit gaf om hun irrigatievoorkeuren ten uitvoer te brengen. Het gemiddelde jaarlijkse watergebruik van 8620 m /ha was slechts 90{\%} van het water dat aan dit gebied was toegewezen, maar wel het hoogste watergebruik van alle studiegebieden. Gemiddeld gebruiken de boeren in Bl-TTS drie irrigatiebeurten, voornamelijk geconcentreerd in de tijd voor zaaien van hun groentengewassen, wat het belangrijkste gewas is. Het gemiddelde debiet dat geleverd werd (398 liter/sec) was 30{\%} hoger dan het officiele debiet van 300 liter/sec. Ook al was er een variatie gedurende het jaar Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project en tussen boeren, de gemiddelde tijdsduur van irrigatie op veldniveau was 3,3 uur per hectare. Dit is de langste irrigatieduur van de studiegebieden, en bijna vier keer groter dan de officiele 50 minuten per hectare. Hoge debieten en lange leveringstijd leiden tot een gemiddelde bruto irrigatiediepte (327 mm) die 3,6 keer groter is dan de officiele diepte van 90 mm, en veruit de grootste binnen de bestudeerde gebieden.De zaak van de RS tertiaire eenheid wordt beschreven in hoofdstuk 8 en is een representatief geval van modernisatie van waterverdeling binnen een acequia, die gecontroleerd wordt door een heterogene groep watergebruikers. Het belangrijkste verschil met de vorige gevallen is dat het modernisatiepakket van toepassing op dit gebied alleen een verandering van irrigatiewaterlevering bevatte, en slechts een minimale verbetering van waterwerken. Er was een heterogeen productiesysteem in dit gebied, waarin kleine familiebedrijven en zeer grote ondernemingen samen bestonden, en een grote aanwezigheid van PRETA's die 30{\%} van het totale gebied met waterrechten vertegenwoordigde binnen de RS eenheid in het 2000-2001 groeiseizoen.De belangrijkste conclusies in dit geval laten zien dat, zoals in de vorige beschrijvingen, boeren van het RS gebied de mogelijkheid hadden om officiele irrigatierotaties te hervormen en waterverdeling flexibeler te maken om aan hun eisen te voldoen. Het blijkt dat de irrigatiepraktijken niet anders zijn dan van boeren in andere gebieden, en de praktijken veranderen ook niet in relatie met het type bedrijf, of status van waterrechten. Dezelfde tegenstrijdige eigenschappen komen tevoorschijn vanuit een water exploitatie perspectief. Irrigatiestrategie was voornamelijk gebaseerd op een grote irrigatiegift voor het zaaien, en weinig giften gedurende de gewasontwikkeling, wat overeenkomt met beschermende irrigatiepraktijken. Water wordt niet beschouwd als een schaars goed tijdens watergiften, en, zoals in andere gebieden, wordt gebruikt als een vervanging van andere minder beschikbare middelen (onder andere geld voor landegalisatie, mankracht voor een beter controle van watergiften, en geld voor aanpassingen aan de infrastructuur om de endemische reducties van debieten aan het eind van het kanaal tegen te gaan).De duur van de waterlevering in het gebied was gemiddeld 1,8 tot 2 keer hoger dan het officiele geplande gemiddelde leveringsdebiet (487 liter per seconde), de tweenahoogste van alle studies in dit onderzoek. Dit resulteerde in een gemiddelde irrigatiediepte van 291 mm per irrigatiegift, 2,7 keer hoger dan de officiele 90 mm per gift. Er waren geen substantiele verschillen in irrigatiemethoden en watergebruik tussen verschillende type bedrijven, noch tussen verschillende locaties aan het kanaal ('head' en 'tail' van het kanaal) of verschil in waterrechten. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat PRETA's niet tot beter gebruik van water leiden.Modernisatie leidde in dit geval ook niet tot een terugdringing van de verarming van de kleine boeren, wat een gevolg was van neo-liberale politiek en een gebrek aan officiele ondersteuning, niet een gevolg van strijd om water. Het feit dat de meeste van de arme boeren hun landbouwactiviteiten opgegeven hebben resulteerde in een vergroting van het areaal voor gemiddelde en grote boeren. Dit leidde tot een intensievere concentratie van land en water in dit gebied dan in andere gebieden.Hoofdstuk 9 beschrijft het geval van SMFN. Dit gebied is een representatie van ondernemend watergebruik in een niet-gemoderniseerde eenheid. Het areaal met permanente waterrechten is vergelijkbaar met dat van eerder beschreven gebieden, waarbij het grote verschil is dat deze waterrechten in handen zijn van slechts 10 boeren. Desondanks is het gebied nog steeds verdeeld in een mosaicpatroon van velden met en velden zonder permanente waterrechten. Het gebied met permanente waterrechten beslaat slechts 37{\%} van het bruto irrigatiegebied. De beschikbaarheid van land, gecombineerd met de diversiteit van ondernemende productiesystemen die een grote capaciteit hebben om te reageren op marktprikkels, hebben de PRETA's gemaakt tot een regelmatig gebruikt middel waarmee de boeren op marktvragen kunnen reageren. Deze factoren hebben gestage groei ondersteund van het gei'rrigeerde areaal dat de 1020 hectare bereikte in het 2000/2001 groeiseizoen.De studie laat zien dat deze tertiare eenheid op een aantal aspecten meer dan andere eenheden de officiele criteria volgt. Gemiddeld jaarlijks watergebruik varieert tussen 80 en 90{\%} van het toegewezen water en, verschillend van de andere tertiaire eenheden, het gebied onder gewas blijft dicht bij het gebied dat officieel toegewezen waterrechten heeft. Toch waren de gebruikers, die een hoge mate van water controle op veldniveau hebben, in staat om veel aspecten van waterlevering om te zetten naar een flexibel systeem dat beantwoordt aan de vraag.De officieel toegewezen waterhoeveelheid was meer uitzondering dan regel in bijna alle 20 irrigatiebeurten die geanalyseerd zijn. Aan het eind van het San Martin secundaire kanaal werden debieten geleverd tijdens de onderzoeksperiode die 1.9 keer groter waren dan de officieel geplande hoeveelheden, ondanks dat het veld in eigendom was van de 'comuneros' (kanaalwater beheerder) zelf. De geleverde hoeveelheden varieerden tussen irrigatiebeurten en bedrijven, maar waren in de meeste gevallen 20-70{\%} hoger dan de officiele irrigatieduur. Dit kwam neer, voor de SMFN eenheid, op een gemiddelde jaarlijkse levering die 1,5 keer hoger was dan de officiele levering. Dit was de laagste van de bestudeerde tertiaire eenheden. De gemiddelde irrigatiediepte per irrigatiebeurt was 257 mm, de tweede laagste in de studie, maar vergelijkbaar met de diepte die toegepast werd in andere gebieden, en bijna drie keer de officieel toegekende irrigatiediepte.Hoofdstuk 10 bevat een vergelijkende analyse van de resultaten van alle teriaire eenheden die bestudeerd zijn en zoekt naar verklarende ideeen en verbanden. De analyse gebaseerd op de berekende productie-indicatoren toont de inzichten van belanghebbenden op hoog niveau op het beheer van PRD. Dit geeft mogelijkheden tot veel en zeer gevarieerde conclusies.Moderne irrigatieinfrastructuur, grote hoeveelheden waterbeschikbaarheid en een aan de gebruikersvraag beantwoordend beheer van het hoofdsysteem waren niet voldoende om economische ontwikkeling te garanderen, of om de negatieve effecten van een open markt beleid op kleine boeren te overkomen. Moderne faciliteiten waren ook niet voldoende om waterbeheer te verbeteren op bedrijfsniveau. De meeste boeren, inclusief zij die moderne landbouwtechnieken toepassen in de gewasproductie, vervolgen hun traditionele irrigatiepraktijken.Ondanks de moderne irrigatiefaciliteiten, inclusief het reservoir "Rio Hondo", dat een maandelijkse irrigatiewaterhoeveelheid garandeerde omdat irrigatiepraktijken niet al te veel zijn veranderd, gebruiken boeren niet meer dan 30{\%} van de irrigatiebeurten en is basinirrigatie de methode die ze toepassen.De vergelijkbare analyse laat ook zien dat in alle gevallen een groot gebrek aan uniformiteit bestaat van de meeste irrigatieparameters. De frequentie van irrigatiebeurten is erg verschillend van de officiele frequentie; de rotatie van irrigatie binnen een tertiaire eenheid wordt vaak veranderd, vaak door de 'administradores'; de gemiddelde leveringsduur en  Modernization and the Evolution of Irrigation Practices in the Rio Dulce Irrigation Project debieten zijn 2,2 uur en 396 liter per seconde, met een varietiecoefficient van 43{\%} en 41{\%}, terwijl de gemiddelde irrigatiehoeveelheid 275 mm is, met een variatiecoefficient van slechts 15{\%}. De lage variatiecoefficient is een gevolg van het compenseren van irrigatieduur en debiet. Als gevolg van het lage aantal irrigatiegiften per jaar blijft het gemiddelde jaarlijkse waterverbruik (781 mm) onder het volume waar waterrechten voor afgegeven zijn, ondanks de grote individuele irrigatiegiften.De resultaten van de vier studies lieten ook zien dat er vergelijkbare jaarlijkse en maandelijkse patronen bestaan voor de waterbeschikbaarheid en irrigatienauwkeurigheid voor het gehele project en voor de secundaire kanalen. Er zijn variaties tussen de bestudeerde eenheden, maar de relatieve waterbeschikbaarheid en de relatieve irrigatiewater beschikbaarheid geven aan dat alle eenheden op jaarbasis goed nat zijn, onafhankelijk van infrastructuur, productiesysteem, voornaamste gewas of de homogeniteit van de gebruikers. Maandelijkse resultaten waren ook vergelijkbaar met resultaten verkregen in bovenstroomse secties van het systeem, met een hoog watergebruik van juli tot november. Dit bevestigt de grote invloed van irrigatiepraktijken op het veld en tertiair niveau op het beheer van de secundaire kanalen en het hoofdsysteem.Hoofdstuk 11 onderzoekt de alternatieve aanpakken voor irrigatieproductie evaluaties vanuit het gezichtspunt van instituten en gebruikers. Tevens onderzoekt het PRD's effect op het milieu, voornamelijk bodemverzouting, en op het stroomgebied. Alternatieve manieren om systeemproduktie te evalueren van het perspectief van instituten en gebruikers laat zien dat ze uitkomsten zeer waarderen, en dat er verschillen in interpretatie zijn van klassieke indicatoren zoals nauwkeurigheid, precisie in tijd en equity.De huidige en vorige irrigatie-instituten hebben het aantal gebruikersklachten als de enige, expliciete en krachtige indicator gebruikt om hun productiviteit te meten. Het voornaamste doel van de instituten was om het aantal klachten tot een minimum te beperken. Hierdoor werden ze zeer klantvriendelijk, en werd flexibiliteit in waterlevering - een belangrijk element van moderne irrigatie systemen - een logisch gevolg van deze pragmatische benadering, en niet van een weloverwogen besluit tot geplande interventie. Tegelijkertijd geeft dit beleid de gebruikers een krachtige mogelijkheid om de manier waarop het water wordt geleverd in het systeem te bei'nvloeden. In de praktijk werd een hoge waterbeschikbaarheid ten opzichte van het bebouwde areaal een belangrijke determinant om dit doel te bereiken (en om een grote waardering voor het instituut te verkrijgen), ondanks de lage vaardigheden.Waardering van de boeren met de productiviteit van het systeem is ook hoog. Dit is zeer gerelateerd aan de volledige levering van hun lage waterbehoefte gerelateerd aan hun waterbeheer onder de principes van "verzekerende" irrigatie, en hun voorkeur over de manier waarop water geleverd wordt.In relatie tot verzouting staat het PRD synoniem met secundaire verzouting binnen de Argentijnse irrigatiesector. Het is ook geen verrassende conclusie dat de hoge individuele irrigatiegiften resulteren in een ondieper grondwaterniveau en dus een actief secundair verzoutingsproces. Echter, het specifieke element dat het PRD een mosaicpatroon van velden heeft die afwisselend gei'rrigeerd zijn en niet-geirrigeerd, als gevolg van de onderhandelingen in het waterverdelingsproces, heeft er toe geleid dat het niet-ge'irrigeerde gebied ongewild als zoutopslag gebruikt wordt binnen het PRD. Dit proces heeft negatieve effecten op de landeigenaren binnen het PRD, die ook al negatief bei'nvloed waren door de uitsluiting van irrigatie, en resulteert in hoge kosten voor de provinciale ontwikkeling.Tegelijkertijd wordt het non-beneficiele gebruik van irrigatiewater vergroot door de waterconsumptie van natuurlijke begroeiing die op de niet-gei'rrigeerde gebieden staan. Dit heeft weer tot gevolg dat afvloeing uit het PRD tot een minimum is gereduceerd, en dat het PRD dus een gesloten irrigatiesysteem is. Deze eigenschap moet serieus meegenomen worden in toekomstige interventies en in de planning van waterbeheer op stroomgebied niveau.Hoofdstuk 12 sluit dit proefschrift met een review van de vragen van het raamwerk dat binnen deze studie ontwikkeld is, en de belangrijkste conclusies. Het geeft ook een korte discussie op onderwerpen die op de agenda gezet moeten worden voor een nieuwe ronde van modernisatie in het PRD.De conclusies omvatten een groot aantal onderwerpen maar richten zich op het pragmatische karakter van het evolutionaire pad van PRD, het ontrafelen van modernisatie interventies door lokale betrokkenen om hun werkelijke noodzaak te analyseren, inclusief de vasthoudendheid aan traditionele irrigatiepraktijken in gemoderniseerde gebieden; en het aangepaste beheer van de irrigatie-instituten om zo dicht mogelijk de service te benaderen van een modernisatiepakket zonder het gebruik van in literatuur genoemde productiviteit indicatoren. Tevens geeft het de bruikbaarheid aan van vergelijkende indicatoren die op maandelijkse basis gebruikt worden om de diversiviteit binnen het grotere irrigatie systeem aan te duiden. Op grotere schaal benadrukt de studie de veranderende rol van irrigatie in het gebied als een sociale kracht voor ontwikkeling en als een reden van sociale buitensluiting en sociale differentiatie.Het hoofdstuk benadrukt dat het geval van de PRD is van groot belang om aan te tonen dat een nieuwe ronde van modernisatie van het PRD - en elk ander groot irrigatiesysteem - op een ander manier aangepakt moet worden om effectief te zijn, en een verschillende hoeveelheid oplossingen moet aandragen voor de diversiviteit die in het gebied aanwezig is. Daarom is het noodzakelijk om de volgende modernisatieronde te zien als "UNA TARE DE TODOS" (een collectieve activiteit).},

abstract = {Irrigation water management in the paddy cultivation area under the left bank canal of the Kaudulla reservoir (Kaudulla tank) in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka has become a serious issue due to limited water availability and inefficient water distribution infrastructure at present. Insufficient storage capacities of the village tanks in the cultivation area, low rainfall during some months and regulated inflow from the transbasin diversion to Kaudulla tank have had a significant impact on yield in the two cultivation seasons of the year. In this article, modernization of irrigation infrastructure in the command area was investigated for effective utilization of limited available water. The results of the calibrated and validated Hydrologic Engineering Centre - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model and Crop Water and Irrigation Requirements Program (CROPWAT) model were used with Water Evaluation and Planning Model (WEAP) to evaluate the water balance and demand to identify the best investment for improving irrigation water supply to maximize the return. Economic analysis was carried out using the net present values for different modernization options. Accordingly, the construction of a new canal system and augmentation of the capacities of village tanks from the present total capacity of 3.8–20 MCM was found to be the most appropriate option. This intervention will increase the income from yield by 205 million with a payback period of 12 years in the Yala season.},

@article{McCann2008,
abstract = {Population growth and urbanization are increasing demands on limited renewable water resources in the Mediterranean region. Irrigation is a major water user, and so there has been increased effort to improve its efficiency. Using supplemental irrigation to increase and stabilize the yield of rain-fed crops is potentially an efficient use of water, but scheduling irrigation is difficult because of the unpredictability of the weather. The objectives were: (1) to develop a simple irrigation decision support tool based on the irrigation scheduling spreadsheet program presented in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 (Allen et al., 1998), but with modifications that allow its use in supplemental irrigation; and (2) to evaluate the effect of uncertainties in the input parameters using a 27-year daily climate record for northern Syria. Modifications to the FAO model were incorporated that allow infiltrated rainfall to be stored within the potential root zone so that it can be accessed by the crop later in the season when the root depth has increased. The modified model was tested using a 4-year data set on supplemental irrigation of wheat at Tel Hadya in which a neutron probe was used to measure soil water content in 15 cm increments within the soil profile. The modified model predicted the depth of water within a 1.2-m root zone with a mean absolute error of 23 mm compared to the measured values. Applying the irrigation schedule developed by the model for each year of the climate record and a specified set of conditions to a range of conditions typical for the local area reduced the ratio of actual crop ET to non-stressed crop ET by a maximum of 0.03 at most, from 0.93 to 0.90. This model has potential for use as an irrigation decision support tool at the farm level and also at the level of strategic planning on irrigation water use.},

To contribute to closing this gap, this paper presents the main features of “MONEVA”, an M{\&}E system tailored to PIM/IMT programs, and adapted to different Mediterranean Countries. The system is based on the principles of the Logical Framework Analysis (LFA), which permitted the development of objectives, outcomes, outputs and appropriate indicators for the monitoring of results. MONEVA is integrated with seven menus and many submenus which detailed description is reported in the embedded User's Manual. Only selected options are presented in this paper. The important and innovative features of MONEVA are its capacity to adapt to every country by using only the indicators relevant to the country, and a simple and objective system of evaluation. The results of its application in the pilot countries Jordan and Tunisia, i) demonstrated its flexibility to adapt to local contexts and the easiness of its application which supported its adoption, and ii) validated its characteristics as a Decision Support System (DSS), having a great potential for improving the implementation of the PIM/IMT programs, through the identification of their criticalities and thus, facilitating the definition of corrective actions at government and agency levels, but particularly, at the Water Users' Association (WUA) level.},

abstract = {Since Ethiopia is going through a rapid transformation of its agricultural sector, we assessed the human health and environmental risks due to the past use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as the risks of the current pesticide use by farmers. A monitoring programme and risk assessment was carried out for the Wedecha-Belbela irrigation system in the Debra Zeit area. The Wedecha and Belbela rivers and adjacent temporary ponds were sampled and examined for the presence of OCPs between August and October 2014, while data on the current pesticide use by small- and large-scale farmers was collected by interviews. The usage patterns were evaluated for risks of using the river or temporary ponds as source of drinking water and for risks for the aquatic ecosystems in the river and ponds with the aid of the PRIMET{\_}Registration{\_}Ethiopa{\_}1.1 model. The samples were collected in five sampling periods, and results indicate that most of the 18 target OCPs were not detected above the detection limit, while g-chlordane may pose chronic risks when surface water is used as drinking water. Endosulfan and heptachlor pose risks to aquatic organisms at second-tier level, while for heptachlor-epoxide B, g-chlordane and b-BHC only risks could be determined at the first tier due to a lack of data. For all nine pesticides used by small-scale farmers the calculated acute risks to humans were low. Second tier risk assessment for the aquatic ecosystem indicated that lambda-cyhalothrin, endosulfan, profenofos, and diazinon may pose high risks.},

abstract = {The persistent and worsening effects of the COVID-19 crisis on rural household incomes are alarming. The onset of the second wave of infections and mitigation measures in Myanmar is continuing to depress household incomes. Key findings: Almost three-quarters of the households surveyed reported lower household income than usual in August and September. In addition to a drought and lack of irrigation water limiting crop production in August and September, 22 percent of farmers experienced difficulties accessing inputs and 28 percent invested less than usual in their farm due to financial constraints. A quarter of farmers experienced difficulties selling their produce, which is lower than the share that reported having such difficulties in previous months. However, farmers anticipate further difficulties hampering sales in coming months, mainly due to expected restrictions on mobility. Landless households have been the most adversely affected by the crisis, largely due to lost nonfarm employment, lower remittances, and further negative impacts on rural enterprises. To cope with reduced incomes, 61 percent of households reported having reduced food expenditures, 36 percent sold assets, and 37 percent took loans. Households maintained the diversity of their diets but reduced the amount of meat and fish consumed. More households reported meat and fish to be less available than in previous rounds. Government transfer programs reached 99 percent of households in the study area, mostly in the form of income assistance. Recommended actions: Assistance to rural households should be continued to soften the impact of reduced income during the COVID-19 crisis and prevent households from jeopardizing future food security and health by depleting savings and assets, acquiring debt, and reducing food expenditures. Supporting rural non-farm businesses and employment will be key to building resilience in household livelihoods and to achieving a faster overall economic recovery.},

abstract = {The influence of underground coal mining activities has become a leading issue in contaminating water resources as well as depleting the water layer around the mining area. The studied mining area is a plain land which is predominantly used for irrigation purposes where underground water is the main source of water for irrigation. In the case of Barapukuria Coal Mine (BCM), a huge volume of water is pumped regularly from the underground roadway to the surface. Thus, this study takes account of the estimated quantity and quality of water used for irrigation and other uses. Therefore, this study monitored and assessed the quantity and quality of inflow water in the roadway for 13 years. The observation shows that the inflow water volume was about 11,183.52m3/day in 2001, and it has increased up to 43,396.80m3/day in 2013. These results implied that the increment of inflow water intensities is very high with increasing the mining operation. As a result, it might be a considerable problem to deplete the natural water table, which could change the changing aquifer geometry and influence the safe extraction of coal in future. The qualitative assessment of water shows that the underground roadway water is suitable for irrigation purposes. The overall quality of water is largely controlled by rock weathering and evaporation natural processes in the area. In fact, the suitability of roadway water for irrigation was evaluated based on SSP, salinity hazard, sodium percent, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, US salinity diagram, Wilcox's diagram, Kelly's ratio, permeability index, Magnesium Hardness, Total Hardness and so on. On the whole, the concentration of such parameters, major cations, anions, trace elements (e.g. As, Cd, Zn, Cr, Cl, Al, Mn), and other elements (e.g. TSS, DO, DOB, Oil and Grease, C. Count, T. Coliform, F. Coliform) did not exceed the permissible limit for irrigation purposes, and thus is suitable for irrigation uses. Conversely, the slight Mg hazard with moderately hard to hard tendencies of water bodies suggests the restricted utilization of this water for irrigation. Therefore, this study finally recommends that the ongoing monitoring program continues with necessary precautionary measures for maintaining the quality of roadway water in the underground tunnel of the mine.},

Subsequently, varying irrigation water qualities were applied, namely Euphrates river water of 2.4 ds.m-1 electrical conductivity (EC), river water + 400 ppm of K+, saline water of 5 ds.m-1EC, and saline water+ 400 ppm of K+. The results revealed the superiority of K+ addition to river and salty water through irrigation substantially antagonized Na+ adversity. Where K+ improved the performance of river water and salty water in plant height (70.71and 72.25 cm, respectively) and leaf area (28.29, and 24.41cm2, respectively) as they compared to river water without K+ (63.83 cm and 21.87 cm2, respectively). IBA99 wheat cultivars showed superiority over others, since it gave the highest plant height (70.375 cm), 1000 seed weights (32.583 g) and grain number per spike (55.475), then comes in the second order Rasheed, as it gave the higher values in plant height (74.41 cm), 1000 seed weight (33.33 g), and spike length (14.816 cm), as compared to Bhooth and Abu Graib cultivars. Then Abu Graib comes in the third order, followed by the worst Bhooth cultivar. Rasheed X + river water + k+was the most potent dual combination, since it showed the highest plant height (78.66 cm), leaf area (35.05 cm2. - 1), and weight of 1000 grain reached (37.33 g). IBA99 + salt water + k+ combination manifested superiority in the grains number of spike which gave 61.36 g. Molecular analysis results in agreement with the those of the morphological analysis by the appearance of TaHKT2;2 gene bands very clear in the Rasheed cultivar, the DNA size of the gene reached 500 nucleotides. Indicating the clear genetic expression of the gene in the varieties (except Abu Graib), especially for the Rasheed cultivar with a combination (Rasheed with salt water + K+), and the positive role played by potassium ion in reducing the harmful effect of sodium ions, Rasheed in the breeding programs of wheat crop to the salt stress tolerance through the hybridization because of its superiority over the rest of the local varieties.},

abstract = {Background: Precise knowledge of the topographic features of the splenic artery and its branches in the hilum region is of practical interest due to the various interventions on the vessels of the spleen. Materials and methods: The anatomy of the spleen was studied by means of macroscopic dissection on 330 organ complexes, which were carefully documented and analyzed statistically. Results: The analysis of the splenic artery trajectory led to identification of four types: straight (43.03{\%}), sinusoidal (27.58{\%}), serpentine (20.91{\%}) and alternating (8.48{\%}). To assess the relation between the trajectory of the splenic artery and its branches we performed a chi square test. Sinuous or serpentine trajectory was associated with the presence of long splenic artery branches (dorsal pancreatic artery or the great pancreatic artery), X2 (2, N = 330) = 12.85, p = 0.001. The artery was located suprapancreatic in 70.30{\%} of cases, anteropancreatic in 4.55{\%}, the vessel had an intrapancreatic course in 14.85{\%} and in 10.00{\%} of cases the artery was located retropancreatic. The presence of inferior polar arteries was associated with a longer pancreas (Spearman's correlation; r = 0.37; p = 0.037). In a multiple regression analysis, inferior polar arteries predicted the length of the pancreas although only a small number of cases could be explained by this model (R2 = 0.127, Adjusted R2 = 0.098; Betta = 0.357; t(330) = 2.091; p = 0.045). There were 30 (9.09{\%}) cases of accessory spleens. Conclusions: The arterial supply of the spleen is highly variable in its trajectory, terminal branches, and relation to other organs. The splenic artery tends to be sinuous or serpentine in zones when a large artery branches off (e.g., the dorsal pancreatic or greater pancreatic artery). Multiple short branches tend to stabilize the trajectory of the splenic artery. Inferior polar arteries and accessory spleens contribute to the length of the pancreas, most likely due to increased vascular supply to the tail of the gland.},

@article{Worqlul2018a,
abstract = {This paper studied the impacts of small-scale irrigation (SSI) interventions on environmental sustainability, agricultural production, and socio-economics using an Integrated Decision Support System (IDSS). The IDSS is comprised of a suite of models, namely the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX), and Farm Income and Nutrition Simulator (FARMSIM). The IDSS was applied in Dimbasinia watershed in northern Ghana using irrigation water from shallow groundwater. The watershed has a modest amount of shallow groundwater resources. However, the average annual irrigation water requirement exceeded the average annual shallow groundwater recharge. It was found that the current crop yield in Dimbasinia watershed was only {\~{}}40{\%} of the potential crop production. This is mainly related to climate variability, low soil fertility, and land-management practices. For example, application of 50 kg/ha urea and 50 kg/ha DAP doubled maize and sorghum yield from the current farmers' practices. Better income was obtained when irrigated vegetables/fodder were cultivated in rotation with sorghum as compared to in rotation with maize. Investment in solar pumps paid better dividends and also supplied clean energy. The socio-economic analysis indicated that having irrigated dry season vegetables will improve household nutrition. Since shallow groundwater recharge alone may not provide sufficient water for irrigation in a sustainable manner, surface water may be stored using water-harvesting structures to supplement the groundwater for irrigation. Integrated use of the water resources will also reduce depletion of the shallow groundwater aquifer. We conclude that IDSS is a promising tool to study gaps and constraints as well as upscaling of SSI.},

With the aim of characterizing the presence of S. enterica in bodies of water, samples from 40 sources were obtained, including rivers and irrigation canals used by agricultural farms in the most populated regions of Chile. As result, 35 S. enterica isolates belonging to several serotypes were detected, with the highest frequency represented by Typhimurium and Enteritidis. All strains showed phenotypic antimicrobial resistance, and most of them were multiresistant to critically important antimicrobials. In addition, the pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis using XbaI and BlnI endonucleases showed that seven Salmonella isolates belonging to serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Infantis had identical pulsotypes to outbreak-associated clinical isolates detected in the Chilean population, suggesting a public health risk of water pollution in this region. Among sampling sites, the higher detection rates were observed in rural than urban and peri-urban areas, suggesting that the animal husbandry might contribute for environmental dispersion of this pathogen. Future efforts should address the characterization of cause-and-effect relationship between water contamination and foodborne disease, including the implementation of surveillance programmes to tackle potential risks for both human and animal populations.},

Then, local passive anaphylaxis assays were applied to investigate the anti-IgE-mediated allergic reaction of the LE in mice (in vivo). A developed LE was administered through nasal irrigation to treat AR in clinic settings. A total of 60 participants diagnosed with AR were included in this clinical trial; they were randomly assigned to three interventions: licorice nasal irrigation (LNI), corticosteroid nasal irrigation (CNI), and saline nasal irrigation (SNI). They performed nasal irrigation once a day for 1 month. Both subjective questionnaires (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22] and visual analog scale [VAS]) and objective examinations (acoustic rhinometry and nasal endoscopy) were used for effectiveness assessments.RESULTSAll three interventions could improve SNOT-22 scores, but the effects of LNI and CNI were more significant. According to VAS scores for nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal pruritus, postnasal discharge, and olfactory disturbance, the effect of LNI was superior to those of CNI and SNI. The results of rhinometry revealed that LNI significantly improved nasal resistance. Endoscopic analysis showed that both LNI and CNI, but not SNI, could significantly improve turbinate hypertrophy. Moreover, the best procedural comfort was found for LNI, which had no side effects or complications during the trial.CONCLUSIONSLNI is a natural, safe, and innovative therapy that can effectively treat AR. Its effect is superior to those of CNI and SNI, and it has greatly improved procedural comfort.},

abstract = {Nasal irrigation (NI) is an old practice of upper respiratory tract care that likely originated in the Ayurvedic medical tradition. It is used alone or in association with other therapies in several conditions-including chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis-and to treat and prevent upper respiratory tract infections, especially in children. However, despite it being largely prescribed in everyday clinical practice, NI is not included or is only briefly mentioned by experts in the guidelines for treatment of upper respiratory tract diseases. In this review, present knowledge about NI and its relevance in clinical practice is discussed to assist physicians in understanding the available evidence and the potential use of this medical intervention. Analysis of the literature showed that NI seems to be effective in the treatment of several acute and chronic sinonasal conditions. However, although in recent years several new studies have been performed, most of the studies that have evaluated NI have relevant methodologic problems. Only multicenter studies enrolling a great number of subjects can solve the problem of the real relevance of NI, and these studies are urgently needed. Methods for performing NI have to be standardized to determine which solutions, devices and durations of treatment are adequate to obtain favorable results. This seems particularly important for children that suffer a great number of sinonasal problems and might benefit significantly from an inexpensive and simple preventive and therapeutic measure such as NI.},

@phdthesis{Raheem2008,
abstract = {Traditional irrigation systems or acequias in New Mexico can be difficult to analyze using traditional economic methods. However, they face a typical economic problem, competition for scarce water. Sometimes seen as in conflict with municipalities in demand for surface water, on the other hand they are considered integral to New Mexican culture, providing critical non-market values. This research begins to create a framework for assessing the total economic value of acequia irrigation for the purposes of comparing that use to other, more easily quantifiable types of use.    The research asks three questions in order to address those values in San Miguel County, New Mexico: how are allocation decisions handled in the acequias of the Gallinas River, do irrigators' responses in an experiment differ from non-irrigators', and how do residents of San Miguel County perceive water use and acequia culture? Three methods are used: the Institutional Analysis and Development (LAD) Framework, a Common Pool Resource (CPR) Experiment, and a Contingent Valuation (CV) Survey.    The IAD interviews provide a baseline of detailed descriptives about acequia irrigation on the Gallinas River; the CPR experiments provide information about whether there are any measurable differences between irrigators on acequias and undergraduate students; the CV survey investigates attitudes toward different water uses and futures, and asks for willingness to pay to protect acequia culture. This would be pursued through a training program addressing traditional and contemporary farming methods, as well as water law and global climate change. Some predictions of local precipitation change show less snow and more rain in future years, a change for which acequias, dependent on snowpack, are totally unprepared.    The acequias on the Gallinas River are far from homogeneous, and employ different strategies to confront varying management issues. Any careful analysis of even a single watershed must consider a heterogeneous management structure. The CPR results suggest that are not significant variations in perception and behavior in withdrawals between the two groups. CV results show that residents of San Miguel County hold positive non-market values for acequia culture, with differences predictably emerging between urban and rural groups.},

abstract = {Groundwater from the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for agricultural irrigation in Arkansas, but groundwater from this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than aquifer recharge in many parts of the state. Rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer. Rice is also a high-cost crop relative to other field crops. This study uses data envelopment analysis and non-radial technical efficiency to evaluate irrigation water efficiency along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the University of Arkansas Rice Research Verification Program (RRVP). The study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression. This study differs from most other studies that focus specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated. We found irrigation water was overused on average by 37.3 {\%} across the 142 fields, with 60 fields (42.3 {\%} of all fields evaluated) over-applying irrigation water by over 50 {\%}. Other rice inputs identified as highly inefficient included herbicides, diesel, and labor, which were overused on average by 46.4 {\%}, 54.6 {\%}, and 58.9 {\%}, respectively, across the 142 fields. Results of the fractional regression analysis revealed management practices significantly improving irrigation water efficiency also significantly improved diesel and labor efficiency as well as overall field efficiency.},

abstract = {Drought is a worldwide problem seriously influencing production of agricultural plants such as coriander, but development of tolerant genotypes is inhibited by a lack of effective selection criteria. The objective of this study was to interpret the relationship between fruit yield and related traits in coriander to evaluate genotype by trait interaction by considering genotype×irrigation interaction. According to this aim, 16 Iranian endemic coriander genotypes were grown in a glasshouse under well watered (WW) and water stressed (WS) conditions. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used, based on genotypic correlation coefficients and genotypic variance estimates obtained from combined analysis of WW and WS conditions and genotype-trait (GT) biplot analysis. Applying both types of analyze to the multiple trait data revealed that SEM and DC+YPr data based GT biplot results are similar. The GT biplot graphically displayed the interrelationships among traits and facilitated visual comparison of genotypes for selection. Predictors in the causal diagram could explain 70.8{\%}, 80.9{\%}, 100{\%} and 41.7{\%} of the total variation in fruit weight per plant (FWPP), fruit number per plant (FNPP), day to end of flowering (DTEOF) and umbel number per plant (UNPP), respectively. Also, the GT biplots explained 81.2{\%} for WW data, 74{\%} for WS data and 79.7{\%} for DC+YPr data. It was found that selection for high SPAD chlorophyll content in the grain filling stage (SCCIGFS), UNPP, FNPP and branch number per plant (BNPP), and low shoot dry weight per plant (SDWPP) and DTEOF should be considered as priorities in breeding programs for coriander aiming for more productive and drought tolerant genotypes. Furthermore, G13 (TN-59-353) can be used as a drought tolerance donor in breeding programs.},

abstract = {Arkansas, which ranks third in the nation in terms of irrigated cropland, relies heavily on the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer for irrigation. Two critical groundwater areas have been identified, with one in the Grand Prairie in central Arkansas and the other along the Cache River in northeast Arkansas. Thus, there has been a call to develop surface water resources for irrigation, and as a result, on-farm irrigation reservoirs have been constructed to capture and store surface water. To assess the current state of surface water development, a remote-sensing survey using National Agricultural Imagery Program data was conducted to provide an inventory of the locations and surface area of on-farm reservoirs in the two critical groundwater areas. Expert consultation and on-site inspections were used to confirm the remote sensing results. In the larger Grand Prairie area, where aquifer decline was recognized earlier, 632 reservoirs were identified for a total surface area of 9,300 ha. In the Cache River area, 143 reservoirs were identified for a total surface area of 2,000 ha. Average reservoir size in both regions was 14.6 ± 20 ha and ranged from 1 to 265 ha. Reservoir area comprised approximately 3{\%} and 1{\%} of the areas of potentially-irrigated cropland in Grand Prairie and Cache River regions, respectively.},

abstract = {Field evaluation of surface irrigation systems play a fundamental role to determine the efficiency of the system as it is being used and to identify management practices and system configurations that can be implemented to improve the irrigation efficiency. This study evaluated the performance of an 'improved' traditional small-scale irrigation practice at Adada, a representative small-scale irrigation practice in Dire Dawa Administrative Council, Eastern Ethiopia. In order to determine numerical values of performance measures, certain parameters were measured/observed before, during and after an irrigation event while farmers are performing their normal irrigation practice. These parameters include: irrigated crop, irrigation method, stream size, cutoff time, soil moisture deficiency, and field size, shape and spacing. The results showed that the irrigation water applied to a farmer's plot during an irrigation event/turn was generally higher than the required depth to be applied per event. Since the irrigation method used was end-dyked, the major cause of water loss was due to deep percolation. The deep percolation loss was 32{\%} in sorghum, 57{\%} in maize, and 70{\%} in tomato and potato fields. The type of irrigation system used, the ridged irrigation practice and the poor irrigation scheduling in the study sites were the main problems identified in the management and operations of the schemes. The following corrective measures are recommended to improve the system: (1) farmers should regulate the depth of irrigation water they apply according to the type of crop and its growth stage, change the field irrigation system and/or configuration especially for shallow rooted row crops, to furrow system, (2) guidance and support to farmers in developing and introduction of appropriate irrigation scheduling, and (3) future development interventions towards improvement of traditional irrigation practices should also focus in improving the on farm irrigation systems in addition to improving physical infrastructure of the scheme.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Opuntia species grow in arid and semiarid lands, where water for irrigation is scarce. However, supplemental irrigation can be a feasible strategy for commercial cactus pear orchards. From 2018 to 2020, a commercial cactus pear orchard was managed to validate the effect of supplemental irrigation on fruit yield, crop water use efficiency, fruit quality, and storability of ‘Roja Lisa' cactus pear grown in the semiarid region of Mexico. The irrigation treatments were no irrigation and supplemental irrigation, with four replications. Crop water use was less and, therefore, water productivity greater in non-irrigated plants than in plants with supplemental irrigation. Mean fruit yield, mean fruit mass, and proportion of commercial fruit increased with supplemental irrigation. These differences were more pronounced in growing seasons with less rainfall. Fruit quality at harvest or after room temperature or cold storage was examined. Fruit mass loss rate was reduced in fruit receiving supplemental irrigation in both storage conditions. In addition, supplemental irrigation was consistent with water savings and food security programs in marginal areas: this irrigation strategy improved both pre- and postharvest some quality components of cactus pear fruit. Therefore, this irrigation strategy is suggested for cactus pear growers, depending on the availability of water for irrigation.},

abstract = {A detailed Diagnostic Analysis (DA) was performed on an irrigation district in Central Arizona as part of a Management Improvement Program (MIP). The DA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team who focused their findings on performance of the irrigated agricultural system, on- and off-farm, rather than on disciplines. This paper reports on the findings related to on-farm management. Specific findings are presented relative to farm water use, soil sustainability, the interactions between the farm irrigation system and the water delivery system, and the adoption and transfer of new technology. The results point to the need for appropriate application of technology, ongoing farmer education, and coordination of farm and district operations and government agency programs. The interdisciplinary nature of the DA team was essential for properly assessing performance. Although this study was done in the state of Arizona in the USA, the methodology used and some of the general conclusions are applicable to other locations, both within and outside the United States.},

abstract = {The growing demand for food to feed the increasing population of India has made it necessary to bring more land under cultivation with assured irrigation facilities. The irrigation sector demands a high amount of the available freshwater resources of the country. Thus, the efficiency of its use is of utmost importance for sustainable agriculture. India is the second‐largest irrigated country and is one of the leading countries in terms of the expansion of irrigated areas in the world. Researchers and various agencies are working towards increasing the irrigation efficiency of the system and the water productivity of the crops. The formulation of any irrigation scheme and policy to be sustainable should be based on scientific inputs and supported by pertinent research studies. The effective communication between policymakers and the research community is the main key to the success of such formulated schemes and policies. This paper provides an overview of current challenges and problems associated with irrigation at the field level vis‐{\`{a}}‐vis research gaps for scientific management of irrigation water in the farmer's field. The apathy of farmers for adopting modern irrigation practices has also been reasoned in this review paper. This review paper would provide an insight into common irrigation‐related problems of farmers to researchers and policymakers.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}La demande croissante de denr{\'{e}}es alimentaires pour nourrir la population croissante de l'Inde a rendu n{\'{e}}cessaire la mise en culture de plus de terres avec des installations d'irrigation assur{\'{e}}es.

abstract = {Long-term studies on plant response mechanisms to different irrigation regimes will provide a better understanding of the survivability and establishment of plant communities in a desert environment. Thus, across 10 years, we regularly investigated the effects of the rainfall (control), rainfall + 4 L h⁻¹, rainfall + 8 L h⁻¹, and rainfall + 12 L h⁻¹ irrigation regimes on the growth and leaf morpho-physiology of Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., Ulmus pumila L., Elaeagnus moorcroftii Wall. ex Schltdl., and Hippophae rhamnoides L. to suggest an optimal irrigation regime for each woody species for effective and sustainable afforestation in Mongolia. We measured the root collar diameter (RCD), annual height growth, survivability, leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf biomass (LB), total chlorophyll concentration, and predawn ($\psi$ₚ) and midday ($\psi$ₘ) leaf water potentials across the treatments and species. Results showed that trees grown at 12 L h⁻¹ grew taller per year and generally resulted in a higher SLA, but generally resulted in a lower survival rate compared with those in the other treatments in all species. Total chlorophyll content was higher in trees grown under 4 and/or 8 L h⁻¹, particularly for T. ramosissima and E. moorcroftii. Lastly, leaf water potentials were found more negative for trees subjected to 4 L h⁻¹, especially in T. ramosissima and U. pumila, but still resulted in a higher survival rate and LB compared with 12 L h⁻¹. H. rhamnoides showed higher survivability at 8 and/or 12 L h⁻¹ than at 4 L h⁻¹. Therefore, we suggest 4 L h⁻¹ to be the optimal irrigation regime for irrigating T. ramosissima, U. pumila and E. moorcroftii, and 8 and/or 12 L h⁻¹ for H. rhamnoides. Our findings are relevant to ensuring the sustainability of afforestation programs in arid and semiarid landscapes in Mongolia.},

@phdthesis{Wibowo2016,
abstract = {Risk averse farmers face a substantial challenge managing irrigation water when they face limited water availability. The two primary reasons for limited water availability in the High Plains Aquifer region of the United States are limited well capacity (i.e., the rate at which groundwater can be extracted) or a constraint imposed by a policy. In this dissertation, I study how risk averse farmers optimally manage limited water availability in the face of weather uncertainty and also the impact of limited water availability on farmer welfare.   I use AquaCrop, a daily biophysical crop simulation model, to predict corn yield under alternative irrigation scenarios with historical weather. Since no simple functional form exists for the crop production function, I use discrete optimization and consider 234,256 potential irrigation strategies. I also account for risk preferences by using expected utility analysis to determine the optimal irrigation strategy. Using a daily biophysical model is important because water stress in a short period of the growing season can impact crop yield (even if average water availability throughout the growing season is sufficient) and well capacity is a constraint on daily water use.  The daily biophysical crop simulation model accounts for the dynamic response of crop production to water availability.   First, I examine how optimal irrigation strategies change due to limited water availability. I find that it is never optimal for irrigators to apply less than a particular minimum instantaneous rate per irrigated acre. An optimal required instantaneous rate implies that a farmer with a low well capacity focuses on adjustment at the extensive margin. On the other hand, farmers who initially have a high well capacity should adjust at the intensive margin in response to well capacity declining. I also find that total water use increases as the degree of risk aversion increases. More risk averse farmers increase water use by increasing irrigation intensity to reduce the variance in corn yields. Another important finding is that a higher well capacity could actually promote less water use because the higher well capacity allows a greater instantaneous rate of application that allows the farmer to decrease irrigation intensity while still maintaining or increasing corn yield. This finding may imply an accelerated rate of groundwater extraction when the groundwater depletion reaches a particular threshold.   Second, I analyze the welfare loss due to limited water availability. The relationship between welfare loss and well capacity due to a policy constraint differs by soil type.  I found the welfare loss from a water constraint policy does not always increase as well capacity increases. Farmers with very high well capacity may make small or no adjustment at the extensive margin due to a higher instantaneous rate and higher soil water holding capacity. However, that is not the case for a farmer with land that has lower soil water holding capacity as the increase in well capacity results in greater welfare loss. I also investigate the effect of risk averse behavior on the magnitude of welfare loss. I found that the welfare loss per unit of reduced water use is lower for the farmer with more risk aversion. Thus, economic models that ignore risk aversion misestimate the cost of reducing water use.    Finally, I investigate the incentive for adopting drip irrigation and its effect on water use. I find that a decrease in well capacity increases the benefits of adopting drip irrigation but is not sufficient to overcome the high initial investment cost without government support. While subsidies of the magnitude offered by current U.S. programs are sufficient to induce drip irrigation adoption, I find that such subsidies have the unintended consequence of increasing total water use, particularly for small well capacities.},

abstract = {Water supply systems are mainly classified into branched and looped network systems. The main difference between these two systems is that, in a branched network system, the flow within each pipe is a known value, whereas in a looped network system, the flow in each pipe is considered an unknown value. Therefore, an analysis of a looped network system is a more complex task. This study aims to develop a technique for estimating the optimal pipe diameter for a looped agricultural irrigation water supply system using a harmony search algorithm, which is an optimization technique. This study mainly serves two purposes. The first is to develop an algorithm and a program for estimating a cost-effective pipe diameter for agricultural irrigation water supply systems using optimization techniques. The second is to validate the developed program by applying the proposed optimized cost-effective pipe diameter to an actual study region (Saemangeum project area, zone 6). The results suggest that the optimal design program, which applies an optimization theory and enhances user convenience, can be effectively applied for the real systems of a looped agricultural irrigation water supply.},

The low humidity, elevated ambient temperatures, and high evaporation rates in the region deemed conventional surface irrigation unsustainable. The IoT-based subsurface smart irrigation systems can be essentially developed for these regions to avoid surface evaporation losses. In this research, the sandy soil conditions of western Saudi Arabia have been considered in numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of a subsurface smart irrigation system. The influence zone of saturation generated by subsurface diffusers in the target root region has been analysed for two different types of sandy soils. The simulation results generated by the COMSOL Multiphysics program reveal that the subsurface smart irrigation system can be effectively applied to simultaneously manage the target root zone at the ideal saturated conditions and prevent surface evaporation losses.},

abstract = {In this research, a reliability-based method for optimum design of the capacity and operation policy for a water resource system including a reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is presented in which important stochastic hydrological, agronomic and economic factors are considered. The developed model is applied for the Marboreh reservoir and the irrigation network in west of Iran in the form of a stochastic mathematical program with the objective function of maximizing the net benefit gained from the crops' production limited to the hydrologic constraints associated with the reservoir and soil moisture of the plants' root zone and the agronomic constraints related to the crops. The decision variables are design parameters of the reservoir capacity, irrigation network area and the crops pattern and the operation parameters which include reservoir operation policy, water allocation to the crops and the irrigation strategy. The uncertain factors considered are the inflow to the reservoir, the water demands, the crops yield, the price of crops and the production costs. Genetic algorithm is used as the optimization routine and a Monte-Carlo routine takes into account the effect of the stochastic outcomes of the uncertain factors. Results state the optimal capacity of 161.8 MCM for the reservoir, area of 31,304 ha for the irrigation network and a volumetric reliability of 72.1{\%} in the neutral to risk condition. In the risky state, the network area is increased and the reservoir capacity and the reliability index are decreased while in the risk-averse state the results are vice versa.},

abstract = {A hindrance to peach culture in the southeastern U.S. is orchard floor vegetation in which weeds can compete for water and nutrients. Young orchards may take longer to come into production if infested with weeds. The common orchard floor management system in the southeastern U.S. is a 3.0 to 3.6 m wide vegetation-free strip in the tree row with an orchard cover of volunteer weedy vegetation. However, reduction of the strip width may be possible through the use of irrigation which could reduce herbicide use. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the optimum vegetation-free strip for irrigated peach with a weedy groundcover. Research was conducted in 2006 to 2008 to determine the optimum vegetation-free strip for irrigated peach with a weedy groundcover, and to evaluate PRE-emergence directed control of weeds that infest peach in North Carolina.    The first experiment included two factors, vegetation-free widths (VFW) of 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3, and 3.6 m and irrigation (either irrigated or nonirrigated). At Jackson Springs, NC, the irrigated VFW which would produce the same yield season total (kg/ha) as the grower standard (3.6 nonirrigated) is 1.16 m, based on results from regression. (For maximum season total, the VFW needed to be 3.6 m.) The irrigated VFWs which would produce the same tree cross-sectional area (TCSA) as the grower standard was 1.5, 1.3 and 0.8 m for trees aged one, two, and three years old, respectively. At Clayton, NC, TCSA in 2007 and 2008 and harvest season totals were not different by irrigation, but did increase linearly with VFW. At both locations, water and nitrogen were probably the limiting factors. Similar across locations, leaf nitrogen concentrations were lower but not deficient in the irrigated trees than the nonirrigated trees, presumably due to leaching of NO3 by irrigation. Foliar N, SPAD measurements, soil moisture, and growth responses were positively related to VFW at Jackson Springs therefore growth responses there were probably due to water and N competition with vegetation. In contrast, foliar N concentration was not different by VFW at Clayton. However, growth responses were positively related to VFW. SPAD measurements increased with VFW so vegetation had some effect on nitrogen. For the first two years of the study, VFW did have an effect on soil moisture at 30 cm depth. Data suggest that a 1.5 m VFW combined with proper irrigation and fertilization will produce tree growth and yield in volunteer weedy vegetation similar to the current grower standard.    The second set of experiments was conducted to determine newly planted peach tolerance to sulfentrazone herbicide applied PRE at various rates and to determine the effect of sequential sulfentrazone when tank mixed with other PRE herbicides (norflurazon, oryzalin, terbacil, rimsulfuron, or flumioxazin). Sulfentrazone PRE did not injure newly planted peach trees. Sulfentrazone alone controlled several broadleaf weeds however it did not adequately control large crabgrass and yellow foxtail. Control of these grasses increased with the addition of norflurazon or oryzalin.    The third set of experiments was conducted to determine tolerance to halosulfuron, mesotrione, and rimsulfuron applied at various rates on newly planted peach. No herbicide reduced TCSA or winter pruning weight relative to the nontreated check. In 2006, some foliar injury from halosulfuron occurred at the higher rates. No visual injury symptoms occurred in 2007 for any study.    Mesotrione, rimsulfuron, and sulfentrazone were safe to newly planted peach and likely would be useful to growers developing weed management programs for peach.},

@article{Liu2011b,
abstract = {Dairy and meat processing industries use large volumes of water to maintain clean, hygienic conditions and are, therefore, major generators of wastewaters. These contain a high organic load, significant quantities of cleaning and sanitizing compounds, relatively high N, P, and Na contents, and show large fluctuations in flow rate and composition on an hourly daily and weekly basis. Before disposal, wastewater undergoes primary and usually secondary treatment. Anaerobic and aerobic digestion methods can be used in secondary treatment, and these can involve extensive (e.g., lagoons) or more costly but more compact alternatives (e.g., suspended biomass and immobilized cell reactors). Treated effluents can be (a) discharged to surface waters, (b) discharged to sewers, or (c) most commonly, irrigated onto land. Indeed, effluent can constitute a cheap source of water and nutrients for pasture/crop production on land surrounding the factory. Annual wastewater application rates are normally governed by the maximum allowable N loading rate and use of spray irrigation systems is favored. Irrigation is not without potential environmental problems such as (a) groundwater contamination, particularly with NO(3); (b) excessive accumulation of Na and an attendant diminution of soil structure; (c) accumulation of soil P; (d) nuisance odors and aerosol drift; and (e) surface runoff to waterways. As a result, an ongoing monitoring program including regular soil and groundwater analysis is typically required. Despite this, a review of literature revealed effluent irrigation has many positive effects on soil quality, including (a) a liming effect, (b) a modest increase in organic matter content, (c) a reduction or elimination of the need to apply N and P fertilizers, (d) improved aggregate stability when the soil is left undisturbed, and (e) an increase in the size and activity of the soil microbial community. Management of irrigation systems should aim to minimize any detrimental environmental effects while maximizing the positive effects on soil quality and plant production.},

abstract = {The effects of overhead and drip tube irrigation on twospotted spider mite (TSMs) (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and predatory mite (PMs) (Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot) populations, as well as the biological control of TSMs by PMs, were investigated on Impatiens wallerana Hook. f. 'Impulse Orange'. To determine the effects of the two irrigation methods on TSM populations, plants were inoculated with female TSMs 6 weeks after seeding. Plants were then irrigated twice every three days, and TSM counts were taken 3 weeks later. To assess the effects of irrigation method on PMs, plants were inoculated with TSMs 6 weeks after seeding, PMs were released 10 days later, plants were irrigated about once per day, and the number of predatory mites on plants was counted 3 weeks after release. To assess the effects of irrigation method on the biological control of TSMs by PMs, plants were inoculated with TSMs and PMs were released as before, but then plants were irrigated either three times every 2 days or three times every 4 days using either drip or overhead irrigation. The number of TSMs on plants and the number of leaves showing TSM feeding injury were measured 3 weeks after predator release. Overhead watering significantly reduced TSM and PM populations as much as 68- and 1538-fold, respectively, compared to drip irrigation with microtubes. Perhaps more important, overhead watering with or without predators significantly reduced the number of leaves sustaining TSM feeding injury as much as 4-fold compared to drip irrigation. These results confirm the common observation that TSM infestations and injury may be reduced by irrigation systems that wet plant foliage. However, predators still reduced TSMs even though overhead irrigation had a suppressive effect on predatory mites. Predators are particularly useful for reducing TSM injury when plants are watered infrequently. Overhead watering could be used in tandem with biological control as a component of an integrated crop management program for TSMs in ornamental greenhouses by rapidly lowering TSM population levels in hot spots before PMs are released.},

abstract = {Introduction and aimRhinosinus disease is common in asthma and causes nasal congestion, post nasal drip and pain. This can lead to altered breathing patterns, particularly mouth breathing which exposes patients airways to cold dehumidified air and may aggravate their asthma. Nasal irrigation is accepted as an appropriate early intervention for managing allergic rhinitis but may be under-utilised in severe asthma. This study aims to evaluate the effects of nasal irrigation in a severe asthma population.MethodThirty patients (23 females, mean age 47), with a confirmed diagnosis of severe asthma (22/30 73{\%} atopic) and rhinosinusitis took part in this study, none of the participants had previous nasal irrigation. Patients were taught to irrigate with the netti pot system (0.9{\%}saline), initially 1-2 times each day and to titrate to individual needs. Symptoms were assessed with snott-22 questionnaires before and after three months of treatment, snott scores range from 0-110, a difference of 8.9 points is the minimal change thought to be clinically significant. Data was also collected on ACQ scores, usage, reported benefits and side effects.Results26 patients were using nasal irrigation at three month follow-up, mean initial snott scores were 63.2 plus or minus 22.9 compared to 41.7 plus or minus 26.8 post treatment (p = 0.0001). 69{\%} (18/26) patients showed clinically significant decreased nasal symptoms, with a mean improvement of 33.7 points. 19{\%} (5/26) showed no significant change and 12{\%} (3/26) had a clinically significant increase in nasal symptoms. 88{\%} (23/26) patients felt their nasal symptoms had improved, 62{\%} (16/26) felt their chest symptoms had improved. Mean initial ACQ 3.42 plus or minus 1.39 compared to 2.62 plus or minus 1.58 post treatment (p = 0.01). Usage ranged from BD to 3-5 times per week. 17{\%} (5/30) of patients reported side effects: headache (2) sneezing(1) Nose bleed(1) LBP(1) three patients stopped treatment due to the side effect.ConclusionAfter three months of nasal irrigation 88{\%} of patients reported improved nasal symptoms, 62{\%} reported improved chest symptoms, there were statistically significant improvements in mean snott 22 and ACQ scores. Nasal irrigation is therefore an effective and inexpensive intervention, with few side effects, in the treatment of rhinosinus and related asthma symptoms and should be advocated in severe asthma clinics.[Figure]},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESISThe use of topical drug delivery through nasal irrigations can minimize systemic side effects and deliver higher concentrations of drugs directly to diseased sinus mucosa. Complications related to this popular method of treatment are not well described. We present our experience with paranasal sinus exostosis (PSE), a new diagnostic entity that appears to be a complication of cold nasal irrigations.STUDY DESIGNRetrospective chart review.METHODSRetrospective chart reviews were performed on patients within the Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 2005 to 2011. Six patients were identified with sinus exostoses. A literature review for "sinonasal exostoses" and "paranasal sinus exostoses" was performed using PubMed.RESULTSSix patients with PSE were identified at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2005 and 2011. All patients had undergone sinus surgery, and none had documented evidence of PSE prior to surgery. There was no evidence of worsening PSE once the cold irrigations were stopped. No patients showed any resolution of PSE over time. None of our patients has progressed to have disease burden significant enough to require intervention.CONCLUSIONSPSE is a rare condition that mirrors a well-described otologic process; exostoses of the external auditory canal. PSE appears to be a complication of cold nasal irrigations. It does not resolve with the halting of cold irrigations, but does not appear to progress further after intervention. PSE only affects postoperative patients. With the evolving trend to treat postoperative sinus disease topically, the clinician should be aware of the dangers of cold irrigations, and patients should be counseled accordingly.},

abstract = {For a successful decision-making process relating to malaria control strategies, entomological surveys are of valuable importance. This is because they help to identify associations between vector abundance and disease intervention in relation to malaria transmission. Sporozoite infectivity rates, parity rates and physiological status of Anopheles species were assessed in this study. A longitudinal survey was conducted in five locations each from intervention and control villages. Monthly mosquito sampling was done for 12 months. Malaria vectors were sampled using pyrethrum spray catch and human landing catch. Sampling was done two days simultaneously each month at both intervention and control villages. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically to species level. Parity was determined using the conventional technique while the presence of malaria sporozoites was determined by examining the salivary glands under a microscope. Mosquito infectivity rates between villages showed that more of the Anopheles species caught from intervention village (An. gambiae, 38.4{\%}; An. funestus, 20.5{\%}) were more infected as compared to those from control village (An. gambiae 22.6{\%}; An. funestus 3.1{\%}). Dry season mosquitoes were more parous (48.1{\%}) than those in the rainy season (31.4{\%}). In the intervention village more of the mosquitoes were fed (46.8{\%}) as compared to those caught in the control village (18.3{\%}). The detection of more sporozoites in An. gambiae s.l mosquitoes indicates that it is the most efficient malaria vector species in the study area and environs. The risk of infection is higher in the intervention village than the control village.},

The number of inflammation episodes in the year before and the year after treatment was analysed.ResultsA total of 15 patients with JRP were evaluated, of whom 10 met the criteria for irrigation. Data from 9 patients were available. The procedure was performed without incident in all of the patients. There was no difficulty with probing the duct and no need for orifice dilation. No post-lavage complications were observed.Four patients had complete resolution of inflammation events (44.4{\%}), and the remaining 5 patients had a decrease in the number of events. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant difference between the number of inflammation events before and after the intervention (p = 0.009).ConclusionsParotid irrigation with saline solution could be a safe and effective first-line technique for the treatment of JRP.Level-of-evidenceIV.},

@article{Swain2008,
abstract = {During the last decade, most of the major states of India have undertaken profound reform measures in the irrigation sector to facilitate farmers' participation in irrigation management either under externally aided irrigation development and agricultural intensification programs or through state government initiatives. These states emphasize decentralization of water management and empowerment of water users by encouraging the farmers to form Water Users Associations (WUAs) to take over the responsibility of operation and maintenance of downstream parts of the irrigation system, distribution of water among water users, and collection of water rates. Although thousands of WUAs have been formed across India and these have taken over the management functions of irrigation systems, the functional efficiency of WUAs in ensuring efficient water use and equitable water allocation is far from satisfactory. A careful examination of the implementation of participatory irrigation management (PIM) in India reveals that the process is fraught with many difficulties due to heterogeneity of farmers, caste-class cleavages, physical system inefficiency, half-hearted support from the irrigation bureaucracy, lack of committed local leadership, inadequate capacity building, and lack of proper incentives. The ultimate success and sustainability of the PIM movement depends on some fundamental factors, such as cohesiveness, common interest and collective efforts of water users, effective leadership of the office bearers of WUAs, political will of the party in power, bureaucratic commitment of irrigation executives, governmental patronage, legal support, financial viability of WUAs, and the catalyzing role of the change agents. To achieve the intended benefits of PIM, an integrated and comprehensive reform is necessary.},

abstract = {The improvement of the quality of treated wastewater allowed increased zooplankton populations in reservoirs that store water for irrigation, causing severe clogging problems in irrigation systems. To cope with the clogging problem we started a research program on the relationships between filter clogging and particle distribution in irrigation reservoirs. The present study targets the water and particles circulation between the reservoir and its bank filters, in order to evaluate potential management procedures to avoid filter clogging. Two reservoirs with different management were selected, in one water for irrigation is removed from under the surface and in the other from over the reservoir bottom. Profiles of temperature, oxygen, time to clog filters of different pore and amount of suspended solids retained by each such filter were measured. Conclusions: (1) Returning backwash reject into the reservoir recovers important amounts of water but also re-introduces clogging-size particles. (2) In a thermally stratified reservoir where water for irrigation is removed from the epilimnion, a daily short-circuit of 10{\%} of the large particles ({\textgreater}150$\mu$m) present in the deep epilimnion occurred between reservoir, irrigation filters and backwash reject. (3) In a thermally stratified reservoir where water for irrigation is removed from the hypolimnion particle concentration in removed water was notably lower and the daily short-circuit did not occur. (4) Removing particles of the backwash before returning the water into the reservoir would avoid short-circuiting of particles and re-introducing live copepods that may reproduce in the reservoir. (5) Removing particles through sedimentation requires a retaining time of at least half an hour before returning the water into the reservoir, and a way to transport away from the reservoir and dispose the sedimented material. (6) Returning water into the hypolimnion is a management option to recover water while avoiding/reducing the backwash reject negative effect on filter clogging.},

@phdthesis{Sinha2020,
abstract = {Agriculture-dependent societies invest in irrigation infrastructure to enhance water security for agricultural production and improve farmers' livelihoods in the face of hydroclimatic risks. While these investments have historically contributed to food security and economic growth, we have an incomplete understanding of their distributional impacts. We lack evidence of the dynamic outcomes of investments in irrigated agriculture in specific contexts with respect to uncertain hydrological cycles, policy impacts, and socio-economic poverty. This thesis addresses this gap by exploring how investments in irrigation infrastructure influence agricultural, poverty, and behavioural outcomes. To do so, it uses a ten-year World Bank funded programme to modernise irrigation infrastructure in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh (MP) as a case study. The thesis builds upon prior work analysing the relation between infrastructure, water security, and the economy. In particular, it relates to the literature on: (1) the association between hydrological variability, rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure, and crop yields; (2) the distributional impacts of irrigation and links to poverty alleviation through well-being; and (3) the role of infrastructure and financial incentives in driving the irrigation choices of farmers. The overarching research question of the thesis is: do investments to modernise and rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure enhance outcomes related to agricultural water security in Madhya Pradesh? To answer this question, the thesis explores the impact of improved infrastructure by examining changes in crop yields, farmer well-being, and irrigation practices by taking into account contextual factors related to hydrological variability, crop price and subsidy policies, socio-economic characteristics of farmers, and social dynamics among farming communities. The thesis utilises a mixed methods approach combining analysis of rainfall anomalies at the district-scale supported by a cross-sectional survey of 918 farmers and consultations with stakeholders from government, donor, and farming communities. The results advance knowledge of the multiscale and multidimensional consequences of irrigation infrastructure investments with implications for water security. The thesis highlights that in the context of Madhya Pradesh: a) there is a positive correlation between infrastructure and crop yields in average rainfall areas and little to no effect of rehabilitation on yields in low or high rainfall areas after accounting for district-scale hydroclimatic variability; b) national food security policies such as the Minimum Support Price for cereal crops are strongly correlated with crop yields more so than hydrological factors; c) access to modernised surface irrigation is positively correlated with improvements in farmers' well-being, with evidence of higher gains among poorest segments of farming communities and where rainfall is low; d) in areas with improved irrigation canals there is reduced probability that farmers will use sprinkler or drip systems and instead prefer to flood irrigate; and, e) social networks strongly influence the irrigation practices of farmers.  While findings remain contextual to the study area and the factors examined, the thesis concludes that a process-driven approach to irrigation investments in the state, focused on improving water supply based on rehabilitation of ageing canals, cannot adequately account for the risks associated with sub-basin hydrological variability and the consequential impacts on crop yields. The thesis calls for further analysis on whether integration of contextual factors related to district-scale rainfall variability data; knowledge of how policies and social norms shape farmer crop and irrigation choices, and well-being responses among different farmers into the design and appraisal of future infrastructure investments may enhance multiscale water security benefits to smallholders in the face of increasing climatic risks to agriculture in India.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs on common pool resource management in the context of village collective-managed irrigation systems (VMISs) in China. Drawing on institutional bricolage theory, we propose that the functioning of a PES program depends on its combination with local institutions. We infer transaction cost-reduction and trust-strengthening mechanisms as the two pathways for institutional bricolage to illustrate the process whereby a PES program enables a VMIS to internalise positive externalities. Based on data from a field survey at the household level, our empirical results confirm that a PES program is an effective means of improving the performance of VMISs in terms of environmental, economic, and equitable benefits, because it aligns benefits for the village collective with those for the overall society. We conclude that a PES program is of greater benefit to communities with local institutions and that PES programs and local institutions exert an interactive impact as they reinforce each other's effect on common pool resource management. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

A bivariate sample selection model simultaneously estimated how farm characteristics determine the use and explain the share of a farm that utilizes an irrigation technique. We found that the irrigation techniques in use by family and friends do affect the irrigation techniques a producer uses and the share of acres utilizing different irrigation techniques. A producer with a family or friend that uses end-blocking irrigation is 41{\%} more likely to use end-blocking themselves. Having a family or friend who uses pivot irrigation technology tends to decrease the share of irrigated acres that utilizes end block irrigation by 0.211. We also found that when the irrigation techniques in use by family and friends interact with variables such as location and participation in a regional conservation partnership program, the effects on the producer's decision vary. The share of irrigated acres that use cutback irrigation decreases by 0.21 for a producer who has a peer that uses irrigation scheduling. However, if the producer lives along Crowley's Ridge and has a peer that uses irrigation scheduling, the share of irrigated acres that use cutback irrigation decreases by an additional 0.54.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe primary management of pyogenic spondylodiscitis is conservative. Once the causative organism has been identified, by blood culture or biopsy, administration of appropriate intravenous antibiotics is started. Occasionally patients do not respond to antibiotics and surgical irrigation and debridement is needed. The treatment of these cases is challenging and controversial. Furthermore, many affected patients have significant comorbidities often precluding more extensive surgical intervention. The aim of this study is to describe early results of a novel, minimally invasive percutaneous technique for disc irrigation and debridement in pyogenic spondylodiscitis.Materials and methodsA series of 10 consecutive patients diagnosed with pyogenic spondylodiscitis received percutaneous disc irrigation and debridement. The procedure was performed by inserting two Jamshidi needles percutaneously into the disc space. Indications for surgery were poor response to antibiotic therapy (8 patients) and the need for more extensive biopsy (2 patients). Pre- and postoperative white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and visual analogue score (VAS) for back pain were collected. Minimum follow-up was 18 months, with regular interval assessments.ResultsThere were 7 males and 3 females with a mean age of 67 years. The mean WBC before surgery was 14.63 × 109/L (10.9–26.4) and dropped to 7.48 × 109/L (5.6–9.8) after surgery. The mean preoperative CRP was 188 mg/L (111–250) and decreased to 13.83 mg/L (5–21) after surgery. Similar improvements were seen with ESR. All patients reported significant improvements in ODI and VAS scores after surgery. The average hospital stay after surgery was 8.17 days. All patients had resolution of the infection, and there were no complications associated with the procedure.ConclusionsOur study confirms the feasibility and safety of our percutaneous technique for irrigation and debridement of pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Percutaneous irrigation and suction offers a truly minimally invasive option for managing recalcitrant spondylodiscitis or for diagnostic purposes. The approach used is very similar to discography and can be easily adapted to different hospital settings.Level of EvidenceLevel III},

abstract = {Iran has an arid to semiarid climate with precipitation occurring in the rainy seasons. Producers often use tensiometers for irrigation scheduling because they provide direct measurement of soil moisture status and are easily managed. Electrical resistivity is an effective predictor of various soil hydraulic properties, including water content, degree of saturation, and hydraulic conductivity. An irrigation scheduling system was developed based on soil electrical resistivity. The system consists of a sensor to monitor soil electrical resistivity. Sensors were made from two galvanized sheets buried at 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm in soil. The sensors were in series with a multimeter (20 kohm). The equipment was controlled by a custom-written computer program that requires setting a high tension set point (when irrigation is turned on) and a low tension set point. Sensors at the different depths provided an understanding of how electrical resistivity changes in response to irrigation. Immediately following irrigation the electrical valve automatically closed when the wetting front in the soil passed the sensor, resulting in a value near 100 (maximum resistivity that can be recorded with the system), indicating that the soil was saturated. When the sensor record 100 the common tensiometer reading was 0, indicating a negative correlation between the systems. Moisture changes more rapidly near the soil surface than at lower depths. Irrigation of vegetables can be controlled by measuring soil resistivity and calibrating the system for each crop.},

abstract = {In on-demand pressurized irrigation networks the pressure and discharge requirements at each hydrant are dependent on the irrigation system requirements and the availability of water resources. Possible changes in these requirements can occur in the future because of change of irrigation methods, advances in technology, changes in user practices and behaviour, management decisions or future trends related to effective irrigation water application, altering pressure requirements at hydrants and the discharge at the upstream end of the network. The objective of this paper is to deal with changes in the pressure requirements by using the method of fuzzy linear programming (FLP) for the minimization of the pipes cost during the design stage of such a network. The FLP uses fuzzy numbers for the pressure head constraints at the hydrants. An application of the method in a case study network in Greece is presented and the results are compared with those from the linear programming (LP), focusing on the performance analysis of the generated networks, using the well-known computer program COPAM. The results showed that the network design with FLP can cope better with future changes than the network designed with LP. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

@article{El-Agha2011,
abstract = {This paper provides the methodology and results of a cross-scale diagnostic performance assessment program of the irrigation water management in the old lands of the Nile Delta of Egypt. The analysis was done at three levels; main canal level, branch canals level and on-farm level of the Meet Yazid command (82,740 ha) for the year 2008-2009 to highlight areas for improvement. At the main canal level the annual average percentage of irrigation water returning to drains and groundwater was 53{\%} of the total water supplied. Since Meet Yazid lies at tail end of the delta, and there is groundwater salinity, opportunities for reuse are increasingly limited moving north to Lake Burullus. This would indicate opportunities for real water savings. The results of monthly relative water supply of the main canal indicated mismatch between demand and supply especially during the winter months, and when supply is low farmers do reuse drainage or groundwater. Also, the assessment of the three branch canals showed non-uniformity of water distribution and mismatch between demand and supply even when comparing improved and non-improved canals. At the on-farm level in paddy fields, the amount of irrigation flows to drains and saline sinks varied from 0.46 to 0.71 of inflow. In spite of these values of non-uniformity and low depleted fraction, the relative evapotranspiration (ratio of actual to potential) evaporation was uniformly high, indicating most crops of most farmers were not water stressed, which is also confirmed by the high yield values. The average values of productivity per unit water depleted by ETₐc were 1.04 and 1.05 kg/m³ for rice and wheat fields, respectively, with yields of rice and wheat at 8 and 6 t per ha respectively. On farm and tertiary improvements alone will not yield real water savings, as excess water in the main canal and drains will continue to flow out of the system. Rather the focus should first be on supplies to the main canal, accompanied by more precise on farm and water delivery practices at branch and tertiary levels, and ensuring that environmental flows are met. There is an added advantage of focusing on this tail end region of Egypt that this response would lessen vulnerability to reuse of polluted and saline water.},

abstract = {Effective irrigation service provides the environment for productive and sustainable agriculture vital for incomes and employment, economic growth and lifting people out of, and keeping them out of, poverty. Poorly managed irrigation can have the opposite effect. Irrigation performance assessment is an important management tool to aid in providing sound service. Performance assessment in irrigation and drainage is the systematic observation, documentation and interpretation of activities related to irrigated agriculture with the objective of continuous improvement. In this paper we provide basic concepts of performance assessment, then pay particular attention to aspects of performance assessment and service provision related to poverty alleviation. Particularly important are the management specifications for irrigation service, providing rules for access to water and payment for service. Inequitable access to water and poverty in irrigation are related to the degree to which specifications are met; who is included and excluded from the specifications; and whether specifications encompass the multiple uses and users of water. Primary focus for irrigation service has typically been given to irrigated crop farmers. For poverty alleviation, service provision and related performance assessment programmes need to give due attention to the many other people dependent on irrigation water including the landless, livestock keepers, fishermen and domestic water users. Advances in performance assessment techniques are needed in this area.},

abstract = {Ethiopia has an irrigation potential of 5.3 million ha (Mha) of which 3.7 Mha can be developed using surface water sources, and 1.6 Mha using groundwater and rainwater management. Irrigation contributes to rapid transformation of agriculture as present-day agriculture is dominated by rainfed single crops. The current irrigation development in Ethiopia is about 0.7 Mha, and the performance of the existing schemes is not well understood. As the country is planning to expand irrigated agriculture in the next five years, it will be useful to review existing performance and to identify areas for interventions that help revitalize underperforming systems. In this paper, we have investigated the performances of irrigation at three levels: (a) national level for broad performance, (b) regional level for small-scale irrigation and (c) scheme level for large-scale irrigation. National level indicators measure (i) the relative proportion of operating schemes, (ii) ratio of actually cultivated area to planned command area and (iii) relative number of benefited to targeted number of households. The result shows that 86.5{\%} of schemes are operating, 74.1{\%} of command area is under cultivation and only 46.8{\%} of the planned beneficiaries have benefited from implemented irrigation. For regional level irrigation performances, the regions of Southern Nations and Nationalities and Oromia Regions were investigated. We used technological (structural) and management factors as measures of performances. Sixty-four underperforming schemes were sampled from the two regions to analyse the causes. About 30 parameters were identified as causes of underperformance. Watershed degradation related problems that are causing erosion and sedimentation of water control and conveyance structures are found to be the major cause for structural failures, while lack of sustainable funding, extension of agronomic practice, and post harvest technologies are identified as the top management-related problems. For evaluating performances of large-scale schemes, we used irrigation water delivery performance and output performance indicators applied to six large-scale schemes. Scheme level performance indicators results showed that all of the schemes considered have supplied adequate to excess amounts of water during the period. The Wonji scheme that uses pump diversion showed higher water use efficiency than other schemes that are using simple gravity diversion types. In this case it might be the running costs of pumps that have encouraged efficient management of water. In terms of output performance, sugarcane based irrigation schemes are superior and up to ten times that of banana, cotton, and maize or tobacco production. The results of these assessments are useful for decision-makers and disclosed the low performance of the existing irrigation schemes. They also indicated the need to revitalize existing schemes to improve performance in parallel to the implementation of new projects. The paper also provided new indicators of evaluation of performance with respect to national level, structural and management related performance.},

abstract = {With the introduction of irrigation in areas with rolling topography, low-lying areas are prone to water logging and soil salinization. The problems also occurred in the valley bottoms of the Tungabhadra Irrigation Project (TBP). Subsurface drainage was applied to reclaim the waterlogged saline land in an area of 62ha (1ha = 10,000m2). The drainage system consisted of three pipe drains laid parallel to the valley brook at a spacing of 150m. The monitoring and evaluation of the system revealed that the water table was lowered; electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil decreased and crop yield and cropping intensity increased in the drained area. Hence, the intervention effectively reclaimed the land, even though the spacing was unusually wide. The cultivation of submerged lowland rice aided in the leaching of salts within a period of one year. Originally the drains were thought to function as interceptor drains and their main effect would stem from intercepting the underground seepage water from the canals in the upland. On the other hand, while assessing the performance of the system, it was observed that drainage discharge and EC of the drainage effluent in all three drains were of the same magnitude. It emerges, therefore, that the system was rather working as a normal subsurface drainage system than as an interceptor system.},

abstract = {The overall objective of this study was to evaluate how peri-urban modern small scale irrigation intervention interfaces with the livelihood capitals of female headed households in Kobo town, Ethiopia. To attain this objective, a cross sectional survey method using structured questionnaire was employed on randomly selected 333 households. Descriptive statistics and Sustainable Livelihood Framework were employed to comprehensively assess sample households' access and ownership to various livelihood capitals. The framework constitutes five major livelihood capitals namely; human, physical, natural, financial and social. For these five broad livelihood capitals, a total of 17 key sub-categories of capital indicators were identified and used to develop the livelihood index. Various standardized scaling and indexing methods were adopted for each component of assets to make them comparable among sample households and to allow meaningful interpretation. It is discernable from the asset based portfolio compositions comparison analysis that participant and non-participant households' had marked difference in their access and ownership of livelihood capitals. Moreover, the significant value of the t-test guaranteed participants' and non-participants' unequal access and ownership to livelihood capitals. Therefore, it can be generally inferred that participants had better livelihood capital ownership and access than non-participants. On the other hand, the average weighted livelihood capital index of 0.49 exposes sample households' moderate access and ownership of various livelihood capitals and the limited impact of peri-urban modern small scale irrigation projects on their livelihood. Hence, to properly eradicate poverty and reduce the problem of food insecurity, this survey result urges the need of devising appropriate strategies and programs that can improve female headed households' livelihood capital that can realize sustainable livelihood as well as to the sustainable, effective and efficient performance of irrigation projects.},

abstract = {Myleomeningocele (MMC) is also called spina bifida (SB) and it is a neural tube defect that is diagnosed antenatally. The effects of this congenital anomaly most typically effects the lower extremities along with bowel and bladder control. The neuropathic, also called neurogenic, bowel requires various methods to maintain bowel movements and strategies to attain a life without bowel accidents or soiling. This freedom from bowel accidents is also called pseudo-continence. The focus of this paper is the comparison of bowel symptoms between the use of the Peristeen bowel management system and the cone enema for neuropathic bowel management. The Peristeen system provides colonic irrigation and is purported to have advantages over other bowel management systems such as the cone enema. Colonic irrigation with Peristeen has been shown to be effective in neuropathic bowel management of adults; however, there is limited data in children. Issues related to implementing Peristeen will be explored including expense, staff support, insurance authorization, as well as, departmental obstacles. Alternatives to management of the neuropathic bowel that also fosters patient independence and confidence in pseudo continence will be delineated. A literature review will be detailed including omissions and recommendations for research in the pediatric population. The Peristeen program implementation with barriers and structural requirements is described.     Keywords: cone enema, Peristeen, pseudo-continence, transanal irrigation.},

abstract = {The Peristeen transanal irrigation system is intended to allow people with bowel dysfunction to flush out the lower part of the bowel as part of their bowel management strategy. Peristeen was the subject of an evaluation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, through its Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme, for the management of bowel dysfunction. The company, Coloplast, submitted a case for adoption of the technology, claiming that the technology improves the severity of chronic constipation or faecal incontinence and improves quality of life for people with bowel dysfunction. Other claimed benefits included reduced frequency of UTIs, stoma surgery and hospitalisation rates, as well as reduced costs. The submission was critiqued by Cedar. The clinical evidence assessed included one randomised controlled trial, and 12 observational studies for adults and 11 studies for children. Although there are limitations in the evidence, the assessed studies show some improvement in outcomes for patients who choose to continue using Peristeen. The committee heard from patient experts that Peristeen had improved their lives and allowed them increased independence. The submitted economic evidence had numerous flaws, however following Cedar's changes to the model, and additional sensitivity analysis, the use of Peristeen was judged unlikely to be cost incurring compared with standard bowel care. The Peristeen transanal irrigation system received a positive recommendation in Medical Technologies Guidance 36.},

abstract = {Parthenium argentatum (guayule), originated from northern Mexico and southern Texas deserts, is a good candidate for arid and semi-arid sustainable agricultural systems to produce domestic natural rubber and other industrial byproducts. Exploring the genetic and phenotypic diversities of guayule germplasm collections is required for continuous genetic improvement of guayule characteristics to meet the growing demand of guayule for rubber, resin and latex industries. The current study phenotypically evaluated a larger guayule USDA germplasm collection than before, with 56 accessions for 10 important morphological and agronomic traits evaluated, which include plant biomass, rubber and resin content, rubber and resin yield. The accessions were grown under two different irrigation conditions: well-watered and water-stressed environments. Significant genotypic effects were found for all studied traits indicating the wide genetic variability of this collection. Significant Environmental effects were found in rubber content, resin content, rubber yield and dry weight biomass. No significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) were observed indicating the similarity of those accessions across growing conditions. Moderate to high entry-mean heritability values were estimated for these traits, suggesting that selection is feasible to enhance the genetic gain. Significant inter-trait correlations were found between biomass-related traits and resin/rubber yield, as well as ploidy levels and resin/rubber content, indicating the possibility of improving multiple traits at one time. To conclude, this study explored the phenotypic variations of the USDA guayule germplasm under different irrigation conditions, which will provide recommendations for parent and off-spring selections to enhance the breeding values in guayule breeding programs.},

abstract = {Irrigation reuse of municipal effluents conserves freshwater resources and avoids direct nutrient discharges to surface waters. The sustainability of agricultural reuse programs, however, may be challenged by evolving phosphorus (P)-based nutrient management policies. This paper assesses the agricultural and environmental implications of soil P accumulation from effluent irrigation and discusses sustainability under guidelines to control P export in agricultural runoff and drainage. For typical regulatory maximum irrigation rates (5.1 cm wk super(-1)), secondary effluents containing 3-4 mg P L super(-1) provide similar to 90 kg P ha super(-1) yr super(-1) and cause soil P enrichment beyond levels needed for optimum crop yields. Applied P potentially falls short of crop needs for advanced wastewater treatment processes with low ({\textless}0.5 mg L super(-1)) effluent P or where hydraulic rates are restricted by soil, climatic, or regulatory conditions. Except for some locations where well-drained low P-retention soils overlie shallow groundwater, effluent-irrigated P has minimal impact on water quality. Most site assessment tools (P indices) were developed to identify fields with high P loss vulnerability from manure and commercial fertilizer application and do not explicitly address effluent-applied P. Adoption of P-management regulations not accounting for the differential behavior of P in effluent-irrigated fields may unnecessarily restrict agricultural irrigation of reclaimed water.},

@article{Allende2019,
abstract = {The plant phyllosphere has been defined as a complex, dynamic and ephemeral system harboring a wide variety of microorganisms. Changes in the microbiota of fruit and vegetables have been proven to affect the quality and safety of fresh fruit and vegetables. Several authors have demonstrated that changes in the environment and agricultural practices of primary production affect the plant phyllosphere but also the presence of transient colonizers such as foodborne pathogens. The quality of the irrigation water has been recognized as a critical factor to reduce contamination of fresh produce with plant and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Among the potential intervention strategies available for growers to reduce microbial risk associated to irrigation water, disinfection of irrigation water represents one of the most efficient approaches. There are several commercially available treatments including chlorine dioxide (ClO2), which is an efficient disinfection treatment for irrigation water. However, the impact of residual ClO(2) concentrations, present in treated irrigation water, on the bacterial community of leafy greens has not been evaluated so far. In this study, the impact of ClO(2) for the disinfection of irrigation water constantly applied to grow baby spinach in commercial production fields, on the plant microbial community was evaluated. Baby spinach was sampled at the commercial stage (12-15 cm long measured from the petiole) from plots (0.5-0.8 ha) irrigated with untreated and ClO(2) treated water. Control and treated plants were analysed using next generation sequencing. In terms of bacterial community structure, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and the ANOSIM (R=0.008, p=0.29) test based on Bray-Curtis similarities did not show significant differences between control and ClO(2) treated samples. Regarding the bacterial community composition, the sequences showed that the continuous disinfection of irrigation water with ClO(2) decreased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae of baby spinach by 14 and 19{\%}, respectively, compared to untreated samples. These results were also confirmed using specific qPCR primers for the quantification of these genera. This is a remarkable finding because about 30{\%} of fresh produce losses are attributed to proliferation of the Pseudomonas and safety concerns have been attributed to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.},

abstract = {Maximizing the utilization of water unit is of paramount importance in arid zones and worldwide. This is even more significant when plants are subjected to both thermal and water stress. Hence, a two-year (2014 and 2015 seasons) field trial was carried out to study the effect of three sowing dates (April 21, May 21, and June 21); two irrigation levels (I100 and I85) and two ascorbic acid rates, ASA (0 and 450 mg L−1), on physiological and biochemical traits, productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) of sunflower. Results showed that subjecting sunflower plants to water deficit under any sowing date caused decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoids, oil{\%} and seed yield and an increase in proline content. As averages of the two seasons, ASA treated plants caused increases in seed yield amounted to 11.7{\%}, 10.6{\%} and 8.4{\%} with I100 and 5.1{\%}, 14.4{\%} and 7.7{\%} with I85 compared to non-treated plants sown in April, May and June, respectively. In ASA treated plots, WUE values of sowing in April x I100 or sowing in June x I85 in 2014 and sowing in May x I85 in 2015 were as similar as that of conventional practice (sowing in May x I100 × 0 mg L−1 ASA). Accordingly, results clarify that ASA can be used successfully in sunflower management programs, particularly under abiotic stresses e.g. unfavorable heat and drought.},

abstract = {Maximizing the utilization of water unit is of paramount importance in arid zones and worldwide. This is even more significant when plants are subjected to both thermal and water stress. Hence, a two-year (2014 and 2015 seasons) field trial was carried out to study the effect of three sowing dates (April 21, May 21, and June 21); two irrigation levels (I100 and I85) and two ascorbic acid rates, ASA (0 and 450 mg L⁻¹), on physiological and biochemical traits, productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) of sunflower. Results showed that subjecting sunflower plants to water deficit under any sowing date caused decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoids, oil{\%} and seed yield and an increase in proline content. As averages of the two seasons, ASA treated plants caused increases in seed yield amounted to 11.7{\%}, 10.6{\%} and 8.4{\%} with I100 and 5.1{\%}, 14.4{\%} and 7.7{\%} with I85 compared to non-treated plants sown in April, May and June, respectively. In ASA treated plots, WUE values of sowing in April x I100 or sowing in June x I85 in 2014 and sowing in May x I85 in 2015 were as similar as that of conventional practice (sowing in May x I100 × 0 mg L⁻¹ ASA). Accordingly, results clarify that ASA can be used successfully in sunflower management programs, particularly under abiotic stresses e.g. unfavorable heat and drought.},

abstract = {Periploca angustifolia (Labill.) is a multipurpose xerophytic shrub widely distributed in arid zones. It is used in rehabilitation programs; its exploitation and utilization require the understanding of its behavior under stress conditions such as drought. To evaluate drought response and at what level it becomes irreversible, a new analysis of physiological and biochemical performances of this threatened shrub was conducted to assess possible mechanisms of drought tolerance and how these relate to its ecological success. Eleven-month-old plants, grown under semi-controlled conditions, were subjected to a well-watered control treatment or progressive drought by withholding water for 7, 14 and 21d with subsequent recovery for 7-d. After 7days of drought, followed by rewatering period, no significant effect on all studied parameters was recorded for P. angustifolia. However, from 14 until 21days of withholding irrigation, drought becomes irreversible causing plant damages, may be rewatering has no effect to reduce these damages. A water deficit of 21days RWC (33{\%}), chlorophyll a content (0.083mg{\textperiodcentered}g−1 DW), transpiration 14.7{\%}, as well as water and osmotic potential (−3.40 and −3.78MPa) decreased significantly compared with control. While, proline content (0.25$\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}g−1 FW), soluble sugars (80.52mmol{\textperiodcentered}g−1 DW) and vitamins C, E (1.9mM{\textperiodcentered}g−1 FW) increased significantly that could indicate ability of osmotic adjustment in this species. Also the increases in RWC, water and osmotic potentials values after rewatering period indicate the good recovery of this plant. Based on these experiments, responses of P. angustifolia to water stress were typical of those of xerophytic plants.},

abstract = {Grapevine is a traditionally non-irrigated crop that occupies quite an
extensive agricultural area in dry lands and semi-arid regions.
Recently, irrigation was introduced to increase the low land yield, but
a good compromise between grape quality and yield is of major importance
for the achievement of high-quality products as wine. Therefore,
water-use-efficient irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation programs
need to be developed to improve water-use efficiency, crop productivity
and quality in semi-arid crops.
In the present review, current knowledge on grapevine responses to water
stress is summarised. Based on this knowledge, the usefulness of
different physiological parameters is discussed, and current. knowledge
on their applicability for water stress detection and irrigation
management in grapevines is reviewed. Partial root drying (PRD) and
regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) programs are proposed as the most
promising tools for such purpose. Among RDI programs, several parameters
are proposed as putative indicators of irrigation convenience and
dosage. These are sap flow (measured by sap flow meters), trunk growth
variations (measured by linear transducers of displacement, LTDs),
canopy temperature (assessed by infrared thermometry), reflectance
indices (measured by spectroradiometers or specifically designed
instruments) and chlorophyll fluorescence (measured by either active or
passive fluorometers). Advantages and disadvantages of all these tools
are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Water scarcity and severe environmental degradation are causing water managers in Central Asia to reevaluate irrigation water use. In this area, the goal of any intervention must include water conservation without reducing crop productivity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of two irrigation technologies, regulated deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation, on components of the plant-soil water system for common bean and green gram. The use of both deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation resulted in water savings and reduced crop evaporative consumption. The reduction was greater in green gram than common bean when both technologies were used. The pattern of water extraction from the soil profile, when under stress, was different between the crops. Severely stressed common bean extracted more water at 60 cm than non-stressed plants, whereas severely stressed green gram used less water at all depths. Transpiration rates were generally lower in green gram than common bean and decreased in both crops as soil water deficit increased. However, when the soil water was returned to field capacity by irrigation, common bean's water use was higher than the non-stressed condition while green gram's transpiration rate only increased slightly from the before-irrigation value. Collectively, these results indicate distinct crop-dependent responses to soil drying. Use of the FAO water stress coefficient in predicting evapotranspiration under water-limiting conditions appears to overpredict water use for green gram and could lead to over-irrigation; considerable water savings are available for this crop.},

abstract = {The increasing use of recirculating nutrient solutions and drainage water for irrigation purposes requires effective sanitation methods to minimise the dispersal of plant pathogens. Among these, plant viruses are of particular interest because they cannot be cured. A new disinfection system was tested in regard to its ability to inactivate plant viruses in nutrient solution in greenhouses. Potassium hypochlorite produced onsite by an electrolytic disinfector and injected once weekly into the nutrient solution by a sensor, prevented the dispersal of Pepino mosaic virus in the tomato crop. The management program assures that virus particles released from infected plants do not accumulate, forming an infectious virus reservoir which represents an inoculum potential in the hydroponic system. Both tested applications at 0.2 or 0.5 mg free chlorine/l nutrient solution for 60 or 30 min ensured virus inactivation and did not cause phytotoxicity. The yield of tomato plants grown in KCIO-treated nutrient solution was even significantly higher than that of control plants. PepMV-infected source plants solely bore unmarketable tomatoes showing discoloration. By inhibiting the dispersal of PepMV and the infection of test plants, the amount of unmarketable tomato fruits was reduced rigorously in treated variants.},

An underground water source (drill hole – well capacity 2 l/s with water temperature 10°C) and electricity were available in the locality of the selected area of 1 ha and 0.2{\%} grade of slope (no map was available). The design of the surface and subsurface point irrigation for an area of 128 m 2 is shown together with a brief description of the hydraulic materials used for the development of the original HYBOZAM program, which was programmed in Microsoft Excel editor, especially to design the pipe dimensions of the point irrigation. A combination of two plastic pipes (with diameters 35.4/40 mm and 28.2/32 mm and 20 m lengths each) was used to provide suitable irrigation uniformity from the orifices on the laterals. HYBOZAM program provides a visual evaluation of the discharge distribution uniformity from the orifices on the laterals by its graphical output. An example of Z1 lateral for surface point irrigation (variant 2) is presented. The final result of the design calculation is given in the table presenting the most important outputs, including statistic evaluation of the discharge distribution uniformity. A table is presented for surface point irrigation – variant 2. From the table is it clear that hydraulic requirements as well as discharge distribution uniformity from the orifices on the laterals have been fulfilled.},

abstract = {Tajikistan is a mountainous country with 947 rivers totalling more than 28 500 km and 1 300 lakes with a total areas of 705 km super(2). These waters feed through an extensive irrigation system with 728 00 km of canals and a number of reservoirs, all in the Amudarya and Syrdarya Rivers. A further 36 hydro-electric power plants are planned for construction. Natural fish production of the lakes was around 20 kg/ha. Yields from the regulated water bodies amounted to 20-30 tonnes per year in the 1970s, but were interrupted by the drying out of these bodies due to water regulation. Major contributions to fish catches were made with the construction of the Farkhad, Kayrakkum and Nurek Reservoirs in the 1950s. The original fish stocks came from natural sources and included snow trout (marinka), Amundarya trout, Samarkand kharamulya, Tibet char, Tajik char, Turkestan bullhead, Amudarya goby and topminnows, among others. In 1978, 1 million Siberian peled (Coregonus sp.) and 300 000 reared silver carp were put into the Nurek Reservoir. However, poor feed availability is thought to have impeded the survival of these exotic species. Nevertheless, it is still thought that Nurek can be used for sport fishing and the rearing of rainbow trout. In 1974, in the Kayrakkhum Reservoir, fish yields peaked at 522 tonnes, while it is currently producing 150 tonnes per year. Production is largely based on the natural reproduction, and declines were largely due to overexploitation of the common carp stock. An enhancement programme for the species was introduced, which appears to have reversed the process. The proportion of predatory species in the total stock has been recorded at 32 percent, yet at the same time, these species are considered useful as control species, but not as a contribution to production in terms of volume harvested. A series of stock management actions and remedial water control measures are needed to manage the fishery. However, the large water intake structures of irrigation systems do not have protective measures such as fish screens, which have continuous negative effects on the fish stocks. In recent times, however, the capacity to conduct rearing, stock enhancement and other management measures has been drastically reduced due to obsolete equipment and institutional difficulties. Measures needed to increase fish production include, among others: education of professionals in the sector; commercial fish feed production in the country; improvement water infrastructures and irrigation systems; breeder stock development; reduction of IUU fishing practices; and equiping of irrigation works with fish screens and fish passes. It is should be noted that Decree No. 123 of 2001 allocated 1 million ha of irrigated land to increase feed production to encourage fish pond production.},

abstract = {PURPOSEThis study aimed to determine whether switching from balanced salt solution (BSS) to vancomycin 20 g/mL BSS for incision hydration and eye pressurization reduces the rate of postcataract endophthalmitis.METHODSThis was a patient safety/quality improvement project, including all patients undergoing cataract surgery at the Kaiser Permanente Colorado Ophthalmology Department from January 2002 to December 2014. Throughout the study, patients received vancomycin 20 $\mu$g/mL in the irrigating solution. During the baseline period from 2002 to 2005, surgeons pressurized eyes and hydrated incisions with plain BSS. During the intervention period from 2006 through 2014, surgeons switched from BSS to the vancomycin/BSS irrigating solution for eye pressurization and incision hydration.RESULTSA total of 57,263 cataract operations were performed by 24 surgeons at seven surgical centers: 12,400 in the baseline period and 44,863 in the intervention period. The rate of post-cataract endophthalmitis declined significantly from 5/12,400 (rate: 0.4/1,000) in the baseline period to 1/44,863 (rate: 0.022/1,000) during the intervention period (odds ratio [OR]: 18.1, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 2.11-154.9; $\chi$ (2)=13.5, P=0.00024). Accounting for an estimated 2.05-fold risk reduction due to confounding variables, the risk reduction attributed to the intervention remained significant: (adjusted OR: 8.78, 95{\%} CI: 1.73-44.5; $\chi$ (2)=10.06, P=0.0015). Since 2009, we have not experienced any cases of postcataract endophthalmitis after 32,753 operations.CONCLUSIONWe experienced a significant reduction in postcataract endophthalmitis when we switched from BSS to the vancomycin/BSS irrigating solution for incision hydration and eye pressurization. The pharmacokinetics profile indicates that this switch was important for effective prophylaxis.},

abstract = {Rainfed areas in the Dry-Zone of Sri Lanka are characteristic of extensive marginal agro-ecosystems known as the semi-arid tropics (SAT) populated by poor farming communities. In the Dry-Zone and elsewhere, the traditional response to seasonal water scarcity was to construct rainfall-harvesting devices known as 'tanks'; created by building earthen dykes across ephemeral streams in undulating terrain. Most are held in common ownership by adjacent communities, who use them for multiple functions including irrigation, bathing and fishing. Storage efficiency is enhanced by arranging tanks in cascading sequence within watersheds so that drainage waters can be re-used. The aim of this study was to evolve improved collective strategies for the management of seasonal water bodies (focussing on aquatic production) in order to reduce the vulnerability of the poorest groups. Work commenced with a comprehensive situation analysis, culminating with the formulation of a participatory research agenda for action research based on low-input stocking enhancements. Village livelihoods have traditionally revolved around paddy cultivation as the primary tank function; however, in recent times, water-use strategies have responded to a range of demographic, economic and environmental pressures with implications for the sustainable management of natural resources, especially living aquatic organisms. Natural fish production in the most seasonal tanks relies on intermittent spill-events which link successive tanks; these provide migration routes which permit recruitment of stocks from lower perennial tanks. Rehabilitation initiatives that increase the storage / irrigation capacity of tanks or poorly designed surplus weirs that impede migration have negative impacts on fisheries, though they are rarely considered by planners. The fundamental concept of the purana complex (PC) as the smallest logical sub-component of the watershed for intervention is introduced. Two phases of action research which involved the stocking of ten tanks belonging to seven communities in North West Province (2000-2001). Phase 1 trials encompassed a range of social and physical and settings from lower to upper watershed. Results indicated that the use of costly hatchery-produced seed was unlikely to be sustainable given (1) a background of highly erratic natural production (2) uncertain returns to individual effort and (3) a low priority accorded to fish production from village tanks given the availability of low-cost commercial production from perennial reservoirs. The second phase was restricted to low-caste communities in upper watershed areas and relied entirely on wild-fish stocks captured from perennial reservoirs lower in the watershed. Also emphasis was on intermittent 'staggered' harvesting using hook and line gears rather than the single intensive 'collective harvests' adopted in phase 1 trials. High yield potentials were demonstrated in the smallest tanks ({\textless}4ha) which were devoid of fish stocks during two pervious drought years. Results also indicate that sustainable adoption will be likely only where there is strong social cohesion and representative village leadership. An adaptive learning process which can demonstrate the net benefits of staggered harvesting in seasonal tanks is described. These stocking strategies combined with tank rehabilitation sympathetic to preservation of upstream hydrological linkages, are highly complementary enhancement steps. Results clearly show that together they have potential to maintain the wider aquatic ecosystem on which the poorest groups depend.},

abstract = {Irrigation water used for growing vegetables in urban areas in many low-income countries is contaminated with untreated wastewater. Many wastewater treatment methods are economically prohibitive and continued use of such irrigation water pose health risks for vegetable consumers and farmers. As part of a larger study on possible interventions for health risk reduction, the potential of simple interventions was explored. Column slow sand filters with three levels of sand depths (0.5 m, 0.75 m and 1 m) and fabric filters made of nylon, cotton and netting were assessed. More than 600 water samples were analyzed for helminth eggs and thermotolerant coliforms. Flow rates were also measured. From slow sand filters, 71-96{\%} of helminths and 2 log units (from 7 to 5 log units) of thermotolerant coliforms were removed. Sand depths had no significant influence in the removal. Lower removal rates were achieved by fabric filters, with an average removal of 12-62{\%} for helminth eggs and 1 log unit for thermotolerant coliforms. Nylon filters had higher removal rates especially for helminth eggs (58{\%}). Average flow rates for sand filters were 3 m per day and fabric filters had steady flows of about 1.5 liters per second, but flow reduced with time in cotton filters. The simple filters tested improved the microbial quality of irrigation water and could easily be used in combination with other interventions to further reduce health risks. The unit cost of the filters tested also appear acceptable to farmers and some incentives like better prices will motivate many farmers to invest in such simple interventions.},

abstract = {Development partners and public investors assume that spate irrigation reduces household poverty and malnutrition. This article examines whether the poverty profiles of smallholder farmers and the nutritional outcomes of their children have improved as a result of using spate irrigation. The study areas were in two regional states in Ethiopia. Twenty-five users each, both from traditional and modern spate irrigation schemes, and an equal number of non-users responded to a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measures of 122 children under five were measured using a hanging scale and stadiometer. The results indicated that all poverty indices were significantly lower for the spate irrigation users compared to non-users, and were even lower for modern spate compared to traditional spate systems. Our results did not show gender differences, using sex of the household head as a crude measure of gender, in poverty profiles. Stochastic dominance tests showed that the poverty comparisons between users, traditional and modern, and non-users are statistically robust. It can be concluded that the use of spate irrigation can significantly reduce poverty, and modernizing spate systems further increases its poverty-reduction impact. However, anthropometric measures indicated that use of spate irrigation did not have significant nutritional effects, suggesting the need for nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as nutrition education and awareness and multisectoral collaboration.

abstract = {This paper is part of the multi-country study on pro-poor intervention strategies in irrigated agriculture in Asia carried out by the author at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with national partners in six Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. The study is largely based on primary data collected from over 5400 households in 26 irrigation systems during 2001-2002. This paper summarizes the findings of the study, and further extends the results (as presented in the sister paper in this Special Issue) on direct and indirect benefits and disbenefits of irrigation in terms of their poverty alleviation impacts. The paper examines evidence on poverty-reducing impacts of irrigation in local settings as well as at broader regional levels, and also looks into key factors influencing these impacts, and attempts to answer the following key questions: (i) what is the magnitude of impact of irrigation on poverty reduction; (ii) what is the response of poverty reduction to irrigation or irrigation-induced expansion in agricultural output across various settings; (iii) do poverty-reducing impacts of irrigation vary across systems, and if so, why? Or what are the conditioning factors that determine the anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? The paper offers insights into these questions with analyses and findings from our studies and with review and referencing of other related topical studies on the subject. Finally, the paper draws some generic lessons that could be useful in irrigation investment decisions.},

abstract = {Exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) to plant tissues has been shown to confer tolerance against various abiotic stresses. Recently, SA application through sub-irrigation was shown to improve plant freezing tolerance (FT). For SA treatment to be employable as an effective intervention strategy for frost protection under field conditions, it is important to study its effect on FT when applied as a foliar spray to whole plants. It is also important to determine for how long the FT-improvement by SA lasts. Present study was conducted to compare SA-induced FT of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. 'Reflect') seedlings following SA-application by foliar spray vs. sub-irrigation. Durability of FT-promotive effect of SA was evaluated using three freeze-tests over a 4-d period, i.e., at 10-d, 12-d, and 14-d after the SA application. Freezing stress was applied using a temperature-controlled freeze-thaw protocol, and FT was assessed by visual observations (leaf flaccidness vs. turgidity) as well as ion-leakage assay. Data indicated that both foliar spray and sub-irrigation methods improved FT of the seedlings against a relatively moderate (-5.5 °C) as well as severe stress (-6.5 °C). Moreover, improved FT against moderate stress was sustained over a 4-d period, whereas such benefit waned somewhat against the severe stress. SA-treated leaves' growth performance was similar to the non-treated control based on dry weight, fresh weight, leaf area, and dry weight/leaf area parameters. Our results suggest that SA application as a foliar spray can potentially be used to protect field-grown transplants against episodic frosts.},

However, the season wise utilization remains low with only 1.3 Mha being irrigated in 2000-01. In the ongoing efforts to increase utilization and improve service provision the state government has introduced a series of policies and procedures directed at improving rural livelihoods. Annual performance assessment has been a feature of irrigation management for the past 25 years based on five key parameters. Developing from these basic performance measures the state has joined national and international benchmarking programmes in the search for performance improvements.

@article{InternationalWaterManagementInstitute:113066,
abstract = {Driven largely by financial pressures, many governments are transferring full or partial management responsibility for irrigation systems from government agencies to farmers organized into Water User Associations (WUAs). In most cases, improving the situation of poor farmers has been a secondary aim of this reform. But there is increasing evidence that Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) can actually negatively impact the situation of poor farmers—and, in extreme cases, can even cause the collapse of irrigation schemes. New research assessed two different IMT programs: The Gujarat Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) program, one of the first IMT programs in India, and the Andhra Pradesh Farmers' Management of Irrigation Systems (APFMIS) program, which with its sweeping reforms has served as an example worldwide. This research suggests that even if the IMT process contains all the right ingredients on paper—such as strong voting rights for farmers, irrespective of farm size—poor farmers are less informed on the whole about their rights and so tend to lose out on many of the potential benefits of IMT. The study showed that in both Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh poor farmers tended to participate more in the repair and rehabilitation work, while the larger farmers were more involved in the decision-making process—dominating the meetings and committees (see fig.1). To make IMT more pro-poor, and to ensure the viability of WUAs, which depend heavily on the labor contribution of small farmers, policy makers should take steps to ensure that poor farmers participate equally in decision-making processes. These steps include raising awareness and access to information, and making the election of WUA committees (which favor the village elite) more competitive and transparent. Monitoring participation in WUA activities and decision making against a reliable, and easily available indicator of poverty—farm size—is a key in evaluating equity trends over time.},

@article{Aberra2004,
abstract = {The Mekele Plateau, located in the semi-arid northern highland region of Ethiopia, is a drought-prone, highly degraded area. It has long been neglected by policymakers and thus recurring famine, widespread poverty, armed conflicts and mass outmigration have contributed to the near collapse of the farming systems and the livelihoods of the population. Traditional stream diversion irrigation has been practised in this area for several centuries. The systems of water management in particular may be considered inappropriate owing to the need for thriftiness in water use imposed by the local environment. The systems of headworks and canals are crude and wasteful on water. Recent interventions to improve the small-scale irrigation systems of the area have not been successful. Most interventions have preferred to introduce rainwater harvesting systems using micro-dams rather than trying to upgrade the traditional diversion schemes. Evaluation of irrigation structures in the field, interviews with key informants in government, analysis of documents and discussions with irrigators indicate that both the Ministry of Agriculture and SAERT-Commission's rainwater harvesting programmes have generally failed. The case of the most recent intervention by SAERT has failed because of myopic project planning, inadequate engineering studies, unsound designs, too short a time for implementation, and lack of full farmer involvement at different levels of project planning and implementation.

@phdthesis{Pariyar2010,
abstract = {Whilst the development of irrigation infrastructure has been proposed as a vehicle for poverty reduction in many developing countries, the distributional aspects of irrigation interventions, particularly households' level of access to irrigation water have rarely been explored. Furthermore, previous empirical studies on irrigation performance have been overtly objective and technical with little regard to farmers' needs and concerns. The premise of this is that 'objectivity' is a necessary but insufficient measure of access to irrigation water. In addition to this, whilst irrigation interventions have had some success in ensuring access to water for crop cultivation, the impact of such interventions have been varied amongst irrigation governed by different property right regimes. In response to these concerns, this multidisciplinary study uses mixed methodologies of data collection and analysis to explore a subjective measure of households' access to water from irrigation systems managed by different property right regimes. Using a case study approach, an in-depth institutional analysis of the three irrigation systems has been carried out to identify institutional factors which contributed to unequal level of access to irrigation water. The findings demonstrate that households' level of access to water is influenced by socio-economic status, the physical nature of the canal systems and institutional characteristics of the management regimes. The results from the quantitative analysis reveal a clear pattern of differentiated access to water in irrigation systems under different property right regimes. The results indicate that the tail-enders, female-headed households, dalits and small farmers appear to have weak access to water from the canals. However, farmers along these heterogeneities have different levels of access to water in irrigation systems governed by different property right regimes with farmers in the farmers managed irrigation system performing significantly better than the agency managed and jointly managed irrigation systems. The thesis concludes that institutional dimensions should be taken into consideration by policymakers in order to ensure better access to water in irrigation interventions.},

Irrigated agriculture is a sector that has been growing in the region, with a consequent demand for quality water. One strategy for assessing water quality in rural areas is to adopt monitoring programs, which generate a large amount of data that often needs to be synthesized. The use of indexes is a way of organizing data in a synthetic and easy to understand format. Although initially formulated to assess the quality of drinking water, it is believed that a similar logic can easily be applied to assess the quality of irrigation water. Studies that evaluate the quality of water for irrigation are very common in arid or semi-arid regions, due to the problems of saline water in the soil and crops. On the other hand, the microbiological approach to water is poorly investigated, since contamination of crops can pose a risk to food security. In this work, three water bodies were selected in rural areas due to their preponderant use: irrigation. The monitoring occurred between May 2012 and April 2013 in 9 sampling points. For each sample collected, 22 physical, chemical, and biological parameters were established. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used in the evaluation and selection of water quality variables to compose the WQI. From PCA, it was possible to reduce the number of parameters from 16 to 6 main ones that reflect the water resources characteristics in the region, which were pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, sodium absorption ratio, nitrate, and Escherichia coli. Of the five classes proposed for WQI, two points were classified as “very good.” The other sample points were classified as “good” and “average” for the irrigation practice.

To prospectively evaluate the effect of the time from injury to the initial I{\&}D on infectious complications. A total of 315 patients who were admitted to a level 1 trauma center with open extremity fractures from September 22, 2008, through June 21, 2011, were enrolled in a prospective observational study and followed up for 1 year after discharge (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [16.3] years; 79{\%} were male; and 78.4{\%} were due to blunt trauma). Demographics, mechanism of injury, time to I{\&}D, operative intervention, and incidence of local infectious complications were documented. Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on the time of I{\&}D ({\textless}6 hours, 7-12 hours, 13-18 hours, and 19-24 hours after injury). Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to determine the effect of time to I{\&}D on outcomes. Development of local infectious complications at early ({\textless}30 days) or late ({\textgreater}30 days and {\textless}1 year) intervals from admission. The most frequently injured site was the lower extremity (70.2{\%}), and 47.9{\%} of all injuries were Gustilo classification type III. There was no difference in fracture location, degree of contamination, or antibiotic use between groups. All patients underwent I{\&}D within 24 hours. Overall, 14 patients (4.4{\%}) developed early wound infections, while 10 (3.2{\%}) developed late wound infections (after 30 days). The infection rate was not statistically different on univariate ({\textless}6 hours, 4.7{\%}; 7-12 hours, 7.5{\%}; 13-18 hours, 3.1{\%}; and 19-24 hours, 3.6{\%}; P = .65) or multivariable analysis ({\textless}6-hour group [reference], P = .65; 7- to 12-hour group adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95{\%} CI], 2.1 [0.4-10.2], P = .37; 13- to 18-hour group AOR [95{\%} CI], 0.8 [0.1-4.5], P = .81; 19- to 24-hour group AOR [95{\%} CI], 1.1 [0.2-6.2], P = .90). Time to I{\&}D did not affect the rate of nonunion, hardware failure, length of stay, or mortality. In this prospective analysis, time to I{\&}D did not affect the development of local infectious complications provided it was performed within 24 hours of arrival.},

abstract = {Globally, about 54 million ha of cropland are irrigated with saline water. Globally, the soils associated with about 1 billion ha are affected by salinization. A small decrease in irrigation water salinity (and soil salinity) can result in a disproportionally large increase in crop yield. This study uses a zero-valent iron desalination reactor to effect surface processing of ground water, obtained from an aquifer, to partially desalinate the water. The product water can be used for irrigation, or it can be reinjected into a saline aquifer, to dilute the aquifer water salinity (as part of an aquifer water quality management program), or it can be injected as low-salinity water into an aquifer to provide a recharge barrier to protect against seawater intrusion. The saline water used in this study is processed in a batch flow, bubble column, static bed, diffusion reactor train (0.24 m³), with a processing capacity of 1.7–1.9 m³ d⁻¹ and a processing duration of 3 h. The reactor contained 0.4 kg Fe⁰. A total of 70 batches of saline water (average 6.9 g NaCl L⁻¹; range: 2.66 to 30.5 g NaCl L⁻¹) were processed sequentially using a single Fe⁰ charge, without loss of activity. The average desalination was 24.5{\%}. The reactor used a catalytic pressure swing adsorption–desorption process. The trial results were analysed with respect to Na⁺ ion removal, Cl⁻ ion removal, and the impact of adding trains. The reactor train was then repurposed, using n-Fe⁰ and emulsified m-Fe⁰, to establish the impact of reducing particle size on the amount of desalination, and the amount of n-Fe⁰ required to achieve a specific desalination level.},

abstract = {Loom-dye effluent discharge has constituted a major environmental threat to the people of Belkuchi Upazila of Sirajganj District. The present study was conducted to characterize loom-dye effluents and investigate their health implications by the growth analysis of rice and red amaranth seedlings along with a survey study among the individuals associated with loom-dyeing, weaving, and crop farming activities. A total of twenty-eight loom-dye effluent samples were collected for physicochemical characterization; among them, only three loom-dye effluents, i.e. pink, violet, and black dyes, at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100{\%} were applied as irrigation water to rice and red amaranth. The plant growth experiment was laid out following a completely randomized design with three replicas. Chemical analyses of loom-dye effluents showed the presence of a significant amount of plant nutrients and heavy metals. The mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu were 0.938, 0.046, 0.212, 7.109, 0.609, 0.351, and 0.191 mg L⁻¹, respectively. Among the metals, the concentrations of Pb, Cr, Fe, and Mn were above the recommended limit proposed by the irrigation water guideline value. Application of ≤ 25{\%} pink and violet dye effluent and ≤ 10{\%} black dye effluent had significant (p {\textless} 0.05) and positive impacts on growth and yield parameters. Heavy metal content in seedlings increased with increasing effluent application rate and crossed the utmost permissible limit at higher concentration. Survey data discovered a moderate knowledge level among the respondents, which might account for the indiscriminate discharge of loom-dye effluent into the surrounding environment. Attitudes, practices, and protective behaviours of the respondents also reflect the caused for long-term pollution through loom-dye effluents. To reduce its negative effects on the health and crop environment, the loom-dye effluents should not be discharged indiscriminately and used for crop irrigation without proper treatment. Furthermore, training programs ought to be introduced to educate the individuals involved in the discharge and subsequent use of loom-dye effluents.},

abstract = {This study relates to the Mackenzie Basin case study in New Zealand that exhibits many characteristics of public goods that requires government involvement and covers issues of efficient resource allocation decision-making between irrigation and conservation development in the basin. Many parties have different views on the proposed irrigation project and the policy debate was about whether to support the irrigation given that there are some environmental losses or to support further conservation programmes that forgo economic growth or leave the basin unchanged. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate environmental and social factors associated with irrigation and conservation development in the basin. The study applies choice experiment method by modelling realistic choice processes in ways that frame the issues of Mackenzie Basin within competing substitutes which have opposite environmental outcomes. This framing required an alternative specific experimental design for constructing the choice sets that allow respondents to consider the substitution effects directly giving them a more realistic decision-making context. This approach was compared with the traditional generic design to observe differences in terms of model parameters and willingness-to-pay (WTP) distributions. The results show that the alternative specific design has better predictive power in terms of statistical as well as behavioural interpretation.},

Stress treatment was cut off irrigation at heading stage. Grain yield and other agronomic traits were measured as the phenotypic traits. The result revealed that there are transgressive segregations for all under studied traits. A genetic map was constructed with 808 DArTs markers which these markers covered 5395.69 CM of the genome with the average of 7CM. In total 24 QTLs were identified on 13 chromosomes with additive effect for 12 traits. Four QTLs had R 2{\textgreater}10. The qAL6A was identified for awn length that explained 26.24 percent of the total phenotypic variance. qPL4B was found for peduncle length and contributed 17.15 percent of phenotypic variance and is locating at the same interval with flag leaf sheath length QTL. This phenomenon could be due to polytrophic or due to linkage effect of those genes which control these two traits. Major QTLs associated with grain yield and yield components under limited irrigation condition after validation can be used in plant breeding programs and marker-assisted selection in order to produce tolerant and high performance wheat varieties.},

abstract = {When planning interventions, water and land resource managers increasingly need to take the opinions of stakeholders into account. In the present study, stakeholders' concerns in a multifunctional water system are assessed, with a focus on the debate about the sustainability of irrigation projects in stressed and competing water contexts. The selected case study pertains to the Segarra-Garrigues irrigation canal (Spain), the promotion of which has generated social debate and mobilization, as well as pronouncements from European authorities for ensuring its environmental sustainability. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed by means of a new codification system for identifying the affinities and conflicts arising from existing water demands. Results show that sustainability concepts are more present in civil society than in public administration and private services or the rural community. However, social sustainability and environmental sustainability are a priority for most stakeholders, while the economic perspective of sustainable development has been conditioned by the first two. These results can be used by relevant authorities as a first step in customizing their interventions, as they provide a clear initial idea of what stakeholder priorities are in the framework of sustainable development.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities alter the structure and function of a bacterial community. Furthermore, bacterial communities structured by the conditions the anthropogenic activities present may consequently reduce their stability in response to an unpredicted acute disturbance. The present mesocosm-scale study exposed soil bacterial communities to different irrigation water types, including freshwater, fertilized freshwater, treated wastewater, and artificial wastewater, and evaluated their response to a disturbance caused by heat. These effectors may be considered deterministic and stochastic forces common in agricultural operations of arid and semiarid regions. Bacterial communities under conditions of high mineral and organic carbon availability (artificial wastewater) differed from the native bacterial community and showed a proteobacterial dominance. These bacterial communities had a lower resistance to the heat treatment disturbance than soils under conditions of low resource availability (high-quality treated wastewater or freshwater). The latter soil bacterial communities showed a higher abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Bacilli These results were elucidated by soil under conditions of high resource availability, which lost higher degrees of functional potential and had a greater bacterial community composition change. However, the functional resilience, after the disturbance ended, was higher under a condition of high resource availability despite the bacterial community composition shift and the decrease in species richness. The functional resilience was directly connected to the high growth rates of certain Bacteroidetes and proteobacterial groups. A high stability was found in samples that supported the coexistence of both resistant OTUs and fast-growing OTUs.IMPORTANCE This report presents the results of a study employing a hypothesis-based experimental approach to reveal the forces involved in determining the stability of a soil bacterial community to disturbance. The resultant postdisturbance bacterial community composition dynamics and functionality were analyzed. The paper demonstrates the relatedness of community structure and stability under cultivation conditions prevalent in an arid area under irrigation with water of different qualities. The use of common agricultural practices to demonstrate these features has not been described before. The combination of a fundamental theoretical issue in ecology with common and concerning disturbances caused by agricultural practice makes this study unique. Furthermore, the results of the present study have applicable importance regarding soil conservation, as it enables a better characterization and monitoring of stressed soil bacterial communities and possible intervention to reduce the stress. It will also be of valued interest in coming years, as fresh water scarcity and the use of alternative water sources are expected to rise globally.},

abstract = {Irrigation enhances agricultural yields and stabilizes farmer incomes, but overexploitation has depleted groundwater resources around the globe. Strategies to address this sustainability challenge differ widely. Socio-ecological systems research suggests that management of common pool resources like groundwater would benefit from localized approaches that combine self-organization along with active monitoring. In 2012, the US state of Kansas established a Local Enhanced Management Area (LEMA) program, empowering farmers to work with local and state officials to develop five-year, enforceable groundwater conservation programs. Here, we assessed the efficacy of the first LEMA implemented from 2013 to 2017 using a causal impact methodology based on Bayesian structural time series that is new to agrohydrology. Compared to control scenarios, we found that the LEMA reduced water use by 31{\%} over the five-year period, with early indications of stabilizing groundwater levels. Three main conservation strategies can lead to reduced water use: (1) reducing irrigated area, (2) reducing irrigation amount applied to existing crops through improved efficiency, and/or (3) switching to crops that require less water. To partition water savings among these strategies, we combined satellite-derived irrigated areas and crop type maps with well records. We found that farmers were able to largely maintain irrigated area and achieved the majority of pumping reductions (72{\%}) from improvements in irrigation efficiency, followed by expansion of crops with lower water demand (19{\%}). The results of this analysis demonstrate that conservation programs that are irrigator-driven with regulatory oversight can provide a path toward sustainability in stressed aquifers.},

abstract = {The reduction in agricultural water use in areas of scarce supplies can release significant amounts of water for other uses. As improvements in irrigation systems and management have been widely adopted by fruit tree growers already, there is a need to explore the potential for reducing irrigation requirements via deficit irrigation (DI). It is also important to quantify to what extent the reduction in applied water through DI is translated into net water savings via tree evapotranspiration (ET) reduction. An experiment was conducted in a commercial pistachio orchard in Madera, CA, where a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) program was applied to a 32.3-ha block, while another block of the same size was fully irrigated (FI). Four trees were instrumented with six neutron probe access tubes each, in the two treatments and the soil water balance method was used to determine tree ET. Seasonal irrigation water in FI, applied through a full-coverage microsprinkler system, amounted to 842mm, while only 669mm were applied in RDI. Seasonal ET in FI was 1024mm, of which 308mm were computed as evaporation from soil (E s). In RDI, seasonal ET was reduced to 784mm with 288mm as Es. The reduction in applied water during the deficit period amounted to 147mm. The ET of RDI during the deficit period was also reduced relative to that of FI by 133mm, which represented 33{\%} of the ET of FI during the deficit irrigation period. There was an additional ET reduction in RDI of about 100mm that occurred in the post-deficit period.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SmearOFF solution on smear layer removal by using different irrigation activation techniques. One hundred and twenty mandibular premolars were decoronated, and instrumented with Reciproc up to size 50. Then, the specimens were divided into 6 groups according to the final irrigation activation technique: Group 1: SmearOFF + Conventional syringe irrigation (CSI); Group 2: SmearOFF + Sonic activation (SA); Group 3: SmearOFF + Passive ultrasonic activation (PUA); Group 4:17{\%} EDTA + CSI; Group 5:17{\%} EDTA + SA, and Group 6:17{\%} EDTA + PUA. Teeth were split longitudinally, and specimens were observed under scanning electron microscope. Images were taken from the coronal, middle, and apical thirds of the teeth with 1,000× magnification and analyzed using ImageJ program to calculate total open dentinal tubule areas. Three‐way ANOVA test was applied to reveal any significant differences among solutions, activation techniques and root thirds. There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of irrigation solutions (p {\textgreater} .05). There was a statistically significant difference between PUA and CSI groups (p {\textless} .05). However, no significant difference was observed between PUA and SA, or between SA and CSI (p {\textgreater} .05). All experimental procedures were most effective in the middle region of the root, followed by cervical and apical thirds (p {\textless} .05). PUA showed higher efficacy in smear layer removal compared with CSI. SmearOFF and 17{\%} EDTA showed similar results. The best results in removing smear layer were obtained in the middle region of the root.},

Yet, there are limited varieties available and varietal response to irrigation rate has not been described. To address this, a line-source irrigation trial was conducted with quinoa from commercially available sources and the breeding program at Washington State University. No seed was produced regardless of irrigation rate in either year or field location possibly because of high summer temperatures (pollen sterility or seed abortion) or seed damage from insect feeding (i.e. Lygus hesperus). A minimum of 23 to 42 cm total irrigation was required to produce maximum biomass in 2013. The impact of irrigation rate in 2014 was minimal because of high rainfall. Early season rainfall may be sufficient for quinoa production in this region; however, lack of seed set remains a critical limiting factor.},

abstract = {Rapid health-risk assessment of chlorinated sewage-effluent irrigation of lawns, fields and crops adjacent to populated areas at the University of Western Sydney was carried out in response to warnings from the supplying authority of deteriorating bacteriological quality of the water. Irrigation with low-quality effluent offered potential for the contamination of a range of foodstuffs and the exposure of staff, students and visitors. The need for early investigation was emphasised by eutrophication presenting as sudden algal bloom in one of the campus dams and an odour suggestive of anaerobic proteolysis on irrigation. No baseline data existed regarding improvement or deterioration in water quality with passage through the dams, or relating to potential for direct or indirect exposure. The assessment design incorporated three methodologies to generate biophysical, environmental and social data. Environmental and social data were used to augment short-term data for biophysical indicators in the estimation of risk. Where required qualitative information was converted to quantitative data using categorical ranking tables, and risk evaluation was carried out using ranked risk and uncertainty values. Results for biophysical indicators showed a steady improvement in water quality with passage through campus dams, emphasising a need to regard the impoundments as part of a treatment chain, rather than as passive storage units. Effluent quality at most irrigation sites marginally exceeded regional action thresholds for relevant crop types, suggesting a need for risk management through revised irrigation practice, system design, distribution management and risk communication. Problems requiring urgent intervention included the concentration of contaminants of bovine faecal origin in one dam as the result of a closed loop within the reticulation. Also of concern was the exposure of certain most susceptible individuals including cr{\`{e}}che children who visited pastureland and orchards where irrigated oranges were collected, and potentially immunocompromised or mentally challenged adults in a work-opportunity gardening scheme. Despite its limitations, rapid risk assessment enabled identification and proactive management of major risk factors, promoted risk communication and awareness, and laid the foundation for ongoing risk surveillance.},

abstract = {Irrigation Management Transfer and Participatory Irrigation Management (IMT/PIM) remain popular policies with national governments and international funding institutions. However, despite their widespread application as remedies for poor irrigation system performance, the actual effectiveness of transfer programs is still the subject of much debate and contestation. Our study enters these debates on IMT/PIM through a Systematic Review of all available impact assessments of IMT/PIM in Asia, Africa and Latin America published since 1994. In total we reviewed 131 citations, which together provided 230 case studies of 181 separate IMT/PIM interventions. We found the strength of the methods used to infer impact was low or very low in almost all cases. As important, we found that the distribution of studies was unrepresentative, the data analyzed less than ideal, and the specific criteria for determining success frequently unclear. This leads us to question any overall conclusions based on existing impact evaluations. Our overall conclusion is that research to inform future IMT/PIM policy needs to design better assessments of IMT/PIM performance but that this body of literature must also be supplemented by studies that provide insights into IMT/PIM policy practice.},

abstract = {Cassava has high energy value and rich nutritional content, yet its productivity in the tropics is seriously constrained by abiotic stresses such as water deficit and low potassium (K) nutrition. Systems that allow evaluation of genotypes in the field and greenhouse for nondestructive estimation of plant performance would be useful means for monitoring the health of plants for crop-management decisions. We investigated whether the red–green–blue (RGB) and multispectral images could be used to detect the previsual effects of water deficit and low K in cassava, and whether the crop quality changes due to low moisture and low K could be observed from the images. Pot experiments were conducted with cassava cuttings. The experimental design was a split-plot arranged in a completely randomized design. Treatments were three irrigation doses split into various K rates. Plant images were captured beginning 30 days after planting (DAP) and ended at 90 DAP when plants were harvested. Results show that biomass, chlorophyll, and net photosynthesis were estimated with the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.90), followed by leaf area (R2 = 0.76). Starch, energy, carotenoid, and cyanide were also estimated satisfactorily (R2 {\textgreater} 0.80), although cyanide showed negative regression coefficients. All mineral elements showed lower estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.14–0.48) and exhibited weak associations with the spectral indices. Use of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green area (GA), and simple ratio (SR) indices allowed better estimation of growth and key nutritional traits. Irrigation dose 30{\%} of pot capacity enriched with 0.01 mM K reduced most index values but increased the crop senescence index (CSI). Increasing K to 16 mM over the irrigation doses resulted in high index values, but low CSI. The findings indicate that RGB and multispectral imaging can provide indirect measurements of growth and key nutritional traits in cassava. Hence, they can be used as a tool in various breeding programs to facilitate cultivar evaluation and support management decisions to avert stress, such as the decision to irrigate or apply fertilizers.},

abstract = {Over the past 40+ years, evolution of water institutions responsible for allocation and distribution of water has been enormous. This paper analyzes the evolution of both formal and informal water management institutions and how they affect today's processes of allocating and distributing water in farmer-managed irrigation schemes (FMISs). It also assesses how farmers translate and modify introduced formal institutions in the rights of the existing informal institution while trying to solve water management challenges based on the local conditions. In-depth and focus group data for the study were collected using a checklist of questions administered to 40 informants, one group discussion per village in Itunundu, Mboliboli, Mkula and Magombera villages, Tanzania. The basic argument of this paper is that water institutions have changed over time. Drawing from study findings, the evolution process of water institutions might be understood as an outcome of the government efforts to address emerging challenges with respect to increasing water demand and multi-use. However, institutional evolution is accompanied by some negatives outcomes, as they weaken social norms and threaten sound water management. The experiences from the irrigation schemes highlight the need to include locally evolved institutions while re-crafting formal institutions. Such interventions may well have significant outcomes for efficient, equity and power relations among water users.},

abstract = {The paper looks at the possibilities of improving quality of government services through knowledge management interventions. This is specifically studied in the case of the irrigation services, which are currently perceived to be lacking in several aspects of effectiveness. The paper initially tries to understand the concept of knowledge management from literature as applicable to government systems, based on which a framework for analysing knowledge management in the canal irrigation system have been developed. Through a study of the processes of large canal irrigation systems, the paper analyses the nature of knowledge and knowledge management systems that are essential for the effective functioning of the system. Using a framework based on the relationship between the users and repositories of knowledge, the nature of knowledge management requirements for a canal irrigation system are elaborated. The tentative findings are that in the case of government services, knowledge management can provide a basis for smooth interactions between the different stakeholders including the bureaucracy and the beneficiaries. The paper proposes that many of the current problems besieging large canal irrigation systems can be partly addressed through focused knowledge management initiatives and provides a roadmap for this process.},

abstract = {This study examines the suitability of trunk dendrometers for assessing fruit growth under deficit irrigation (DI) for two consecutive years in a mature citrus orchard. Two DI programmes were applied during the maximum evapotranspirative demand period: sustained-deficit irrigation, applied at 50{\%} ETC on average, and low-frequency deficit irrigation, applied according to plant–water status, establishing different irrigation–restriction cycles. Additionally, a control treatment at 100{\%} ETC was monitored for the entire irrigation season. Trunk daily growth (TDG) and fruit daily growth (FDG) were estimated together with stem-water potential at midday ($\Psi$stem) and the maximum daily shrinkage of the trunk (MDS). Significant relationships were determined for $\Psi$stem vs. TDG (R2=0.60), and vs. FDG (R2=0.78). In addition, significant relationships were established between TDG vs. FDG (R2=0.60), and between the daily increment of MDS ($\Delta$MDS) and FDG (R2=0.50), revealing the strong connection between trunk and fruit variations caused by water stress. According to these findings, the DI effects on fruit growth can be monitored by means of TDF or temporal evolution of $\Psi$stem, promising automation possibilities for appropriately regulating irrigation under DI programmes, and predicting its effects on fruit size by continuous field measurement.},

abstract = {Irrigation water management in Central Asia is notorious for its inefficiency. We assessed the operational performance of the irrigation scheme in one Water Users Association (WUA), Shomakhulum, in Khorezm district, Uzbekistan, in 2007 to provide recommendations for strategic water management planning. Relative evapotranspiration (RET), delivery performance ratio (DPR), drainage ratio (DR), depleted fraction (DF), overall consumed ratio (OCR), field application ratio (FAR) and conveyance ratio (CR) were used as performance indicators. The components of the water balance were obtained through remote sensing techniques and hydrological field measurements. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was applied to MODIS satellite data to derive actual and potential evapotranspiration. Inflows and outflows were quantified with field measurements in the irrigation and drainage network using discharge rating curves. Ponding experiments allowed determining canal seepage losses. Water balances at field level were established for application efficiency estimations. The indicator values were then compared to efficiency target values taken from the literature in order to assess the operational capabilities of the irrigation scheme. The general performance of the irrigation scheme is very poor. DPRs exceeding 1.0 indicate that more water is delivered to the system than is demanded. The seasonal DF of 0.4 is lower than the target value of 0.6. Losses during the field application averaged at 57{\%}, which is 24{\%} above target values. Seasonal DR, OCR, CR and RET are 0.55, 0.51, 0.76 and 0.82 against the target values of 0.1, 0.54, 0.84 and 0.75, respectively. We conclude that the distribution mechanism can be considerably improved. Besides improving water distribution (timing and equity) in the network, another recommended intervention would be to increase the DF, particularly by interventions at field level that raise the FAR, which in turn will improve DR and OCR. This can be achieved by introducing modern water management approaches such as laser leveling, double-sided irrigation, and control of inflow through flow-measuring devices installed at farm gates, and adequate water pricing.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of 17{\%} Ethylene,di-amine, tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), 6{\%} phosphoric acid and Erbium: Yttrium, Aluminum, Garnet (Er:YAG) Laser in removing the smear layer by scanning electron microscopy.   METHODS: In this study, 80 single-rooted human teeth were selected. Instrumentation was done by use of hand files and step-back technique up to file {\#}40 at apical and file {\#}80 at coronal area. During instrumentation, 1ml of 5.25{\%} sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was used as irrigation between each file. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups with different methods of smear removal.17{\%} Ethylene, di-amine, tetra-acetic acid was used in group 1, 6{\%} Phosphoric acid in group 2, Erbium: Yttrium, Aluminum, Garnet laser in group 3, and no intervention in group 4 (as control). Roots were then longitudinally sectioned and prepared for scanning electron micrograph in cervical, middle and apical areas. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Walis, Mann-Whitney, Friedman and Wilcoxson tests (P{\textless}0.05).   RESULTS: The results showed a significant difference in smear layer removal between three methods in favor of the EDTA (P{\textless}0.001) and Phosphoric groups (P{\textless}0.001) with no significant difference between them (P=0.49). Although Er:YAG laser showed some limited ability to remove the smear layer, the effectiveness was not significantly different from the control group (P=0.157).   CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, EDTA and Phosphoric acid were effective methods to remove smear layer from the root canal walls but Er:YAG laser showed less efficacy compared to the other experimental groups.},

abstract = {Institutional fisheries research began in Hungary almost 100 years ago, when the "Royal Experimental Station for Fish Physiology and Waste Water Purification" was established in 1906. The experimental station was in Budapest at that time, and after several reorganizations and relocations, the central fisheries research station found its final place at Szarvas in 1953. The city is located in the southeastern part of Hungary, in the Koeroes River Valley, where fish culture has a long tradition. The station became an internationally acknowledged institute (Fish Culture Research Institute, Hungarian acronym HAKI) after the completion of a UNDP/FAO supported development project in 1980. Because of social and economic changes in Eastern Europe, there have been serious structural and financial difficulties in the research sphere in Hungary during the period from 1991-1996. In spite of the serious cutback in research funding, the valuable research capabilities have been preserved in Hungary. As a result of a painful restructuring program in the Fish Culture Research Institute, the institute became a smaller but more research-oriented institution that also preserved its unique complexity through new types of contacts with farms and development centers. In 2000, the Fish Culture Research Institute and the Research Institute for Irrigation were merged into the Research Institute for Fisheries, Aquaculture and Irrigation (HAKI).},

conducted in the research center Hortinvest, University of Agronomic
Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest. The biological material
used in this study case was the tomato hybrid Cindel. To obtain reliable
conclusions we will provide the same quality parameters of irrigation
water, using the same technology and culture in all experimental
variants. The efficiency techniques that we adopted will be judged by
the size of the achieved production and by assessing the quality indices
of production. During the growing season vegetative growth and biometric
measurements will be monitored and the duration of each phenological
phase it will determine, depending on the technique used. Objectives: To
establish the optimum irrigation, to determine the relationship between
the type of substrate and the height of tomato plants, to determine the
number of irrigations applied during the growing period, to determine
the relationship between crop substrate and plants growth. The research

abstract = {Groundwater use for small-scale irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa is low, though is expected to increase in the near future. There is currently limited understanding of shallow groundwater resources, which are most likely to be exploited by poor rural communities due to their accessibility. This PhD study aimed to determine the potential for use of shallow groundwater for small-scale irrigation and the resilience of the resources to increased abstraction, land-use change and climate variability. Research was conducted principally at a study site in northwest Ethiopia with seasonal rainfall and a predominance of rainfed agriculture. The shallow aquifer comprises a thin weathered regolith above largely impermeable basalt. Hydrochemistry analyses suggested little connection between the shallow aquifer and a deep fractured aquifer. To fill gaps in formal hydrometeorological monitoring, a community-based monitoring programme was initiated. Statistical comparisons confirmed that the datasets were of as high or higher quality as those from formal networks, remote sensing and reanalyses. A recharge assessment estimated annual recharge of 280-430 mm, confirming that a sufficient renewable shallow groundwater resource is available for small-scale irrigation. Four nested catchments were modelled using SHETRAN, a physically-based spatially-distributed modelling program. The modelling identified the foot of hillslopes and narrow valleys as showing the greatest potential for irrigated agriculture as groundwater in those locations remained available and accessible for the longest periods. Potential future scenarios were run in the SHETRAN models considering likely climate variability, land use change and increasing abstraction. Around 35{\%} of arable land in the modelled catchments had shallow groundwater available throughout the dry season. During simulated multi-year droughts, a significant percentage of arable land still had sufficient groundwater available for irrigation of a second growing season. Conversion of pasture and scrubland to cultivated land did not have a significant impact on water resources while degradation of highlands to bareground had a positive impact. The severest impact on water resources resulted from increased coverage of Eucalyptus. Notably, simulation of increased abstraction and irrigation at smallholder levels had little impact on surface and groundwater availability. This study demonstrates the potential for greater exploitation of shallow groundwater for small-scale irrigation by rural communities and the resilience of the resource to climate variability, land use change and increasing abstraction.},

abstract = {The present paper shows the results of field trials carried out in 2010 and 2011 in a cherry plantation (Prunus avium) with a long-lived cultivar, ('Lapins') in the Jerte Valley (C{\'{a}}ceres, Extremadura, Spain) to study the response contrasting irrigation programs. This work contributed to contrasting irrigation strategies, including pre- and postharvest irrigation. Preharvest irrigation programs included three irrigation treatments covering 100{\%} of the ETc and another using traditional irrigation practices in the area, which include no irrigation during the preharvest interval. Postharvest irrigation programs consisted of four deficit irrigation treatments, three of which replaced 25, 50 and 100{\%} of the ETc and one which delivered the average amount of water supplied during postharvest in the area. The experiment was a random block design with four replications. The study indicates that the deficit controlled treatment of replacing 25{\%} of the ETc postharvest for two consecutive years resulted in superior yields than other treatments. Also, the regime using the average farmer's irrigation water and their habitual irrigation practices only postharvest maintained a good yield similar to that obtained by other regimes, which used preharvest irrigation, getting a reduction in the consumption of water up to 60{\%}.},

abstract = {In general, degraded lands in arid and semi-arid regions of India are left fallow to serve as pastures. However, the forage productivity of these degraded land pastures is typically low, unstable, and unremunerative. These practices often result in acute shortages of fodder during the post-monsoon period. These acute shortages may be partially alleviated through the use of saline ground-water resources to supplement water supplies. Findings are reported from a field experiment program implemented from 1993-97 on a calcareous soil in a semi-arid region of northwestern India. The study investigated the performance of forage grasses under saline irrigation. Several different grass species were considered in the study. The most promising species were Panicum laevifolium and P. maximum.},

abstract = {A 2-year greenhouse study was conducted at Clemson University, Clemson, S.C., in 2003 and 2004 to determine drought responses of six bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) cultivars at four irrigation intervals. Cultivars selected from the 2002 National Turfgrass Evaluation Program Bermudagrass Trial were 'SWI-1012', 'Arizona Common', 'Tift No.3', 'Tifsport', 'Aussie Green', and 'Celebration'. Treatments included 5-, 10-, and 15-day irrigation intervals plus a control (irrigated daily). Volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and evapotranspiration (ET) rates were recorded every 3 days. Turfgrass quality (TQ) was observed weekly and root weight was measured at the end of a 6-week study. 'Aussie Green' and 'Celebration' produced the highest TQ rating ({\textgreater}7) at week 4 when watered daily. After 4 weeks of the 5-day irrigation interval, all cultivars showed unacceptable quality ratings ({\textless}7). However, 'Aussie Green' and 'Celebration' were able to maintain an acceptable TQ rating (7), compared to 'Arizona Common' (5.1) and 'Tift No.3' (5.8) at week 2 (5-day treatment). 'Celebration' produced 114{\%} and 97{\%} greater root weight than 'Tifsport' and 'Aussie Green', respectively, when pooled across all irrigation treatments. At the 15-day irrigation interval treatment, six bermudagrass cultivars pooled together produced 78{\%}, 22{\%}, and 11{\%} greater root weight vs. control, 5-day, and 10-day treatments, respectively. When pooled for all treatments, 'Aussie Green' and 'Celebration' VSWC was 5{\%} and 7{\%} lower than 'Tift No.3', and ET rates were 26{\%} and 30{\%} greater than 'Arizona Common'. Based on these results, irrigating bermudagrass in 5-day intervals should be carefully monitored.},

abstract = {Achieving food security along with environmental sustainability requires high yields with reduced demands on irrigation resources for rice production systems. The goal of the present investigation was to identify traits and germplasms for rice breeding programs that target effective grain production (EGP) under non-flooded field systems where the crop can be subjected to intermittent water stress throughout the growing season. A panel of 15 cultivars was evaluated over three years regarding phenological and agronomic traits under four soil moisture levels ranging from field capacity (29{\%} volumetric water content; VWC) to just above the wilting point (16{\%} VWC) using subsurface drip irrigation. An average of 690 ha-mm ha−1 water was applied for the 30{\%} VWC treatment compared to 360 ha-mm ha−1 for the 14{\%} VWC treatment. The average soil moisture content influenced several traits, including grain quality. Regression analysis identified six traits that explained 35{\%} of the phenotypic variability of EGP. Four varieties (PI 312777, Francis, Zhe 733, and Mars) were found possessing significant slopes for 10 or more traits that respond to a range in soil moisture levels, indicating that they may offer promise for future rice breeding programs. Furthermore, based on the contrasting responses of four parent cultivars, two mapping populations were identified as potential genetic resources for identifying new quantitative trait loci/genes for improving EGP of tropical japonica rice varieties.},

@article{YU20191421,
abstract = {Knowledge of forest water use is crucial to water resources managers, especially in arid environments. Flood irrigation has sometimes been used to ameliorate forest decline, however, there has only been limited research on vegetation responses to these interventions. We undertook a study to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) and its components, transpiration (T) and evaporation (E), of two Populus euphratica Oliv. stands (MA: middle-aged and OA: old-aged) with and without flood irrigation in the lower Heihe River Basin of NW China. ET and T were measured using eddy covariance and sap flow methods, respectively. Understory E was estimated by difference. Annual ET was 766.4 mm in the MA stand and 532.5 mm in the OA stand with an average of 4.2 and 2.9 mm d−1 during the growing season, respectively. ET of the MA stand was 44{\%} higher than that of the OA stand, with contributions of 28{\%} and 16{\%} from E and T. Despite stand density, leaf area index and canopy cover being higher in the MA than OA stand sapwood area within the two stands was similar (MA 6.04 m2 ha−1 and OA 6.02 m2 ha−1). We hypothesised lower understory E and a lower E to ET ratio in the MA stand than OA stand. However, E was approximately 63{\%} of ET in both stands. Therefore, we conclude that differences in ET, T and E were mainly associated with the flood irrigation. This was further supported by the comparable ET between the OA stand and the other studies in arid regions of Central Asia. In conclusion, flood irrigation has a less significant effect on canopy water use (T) than understory E suggesting alternatives to flood irrigation might be more appropriate in this water-limited ecosystem.},

abstract = {BackgroundThis study was designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the complex herbal medicine Sinupret{\textregistered} syrup in the treatment of acute viral rhinosinusitis in children.MethodsPatients aged 6 to 11 years were included in a randomised controlled study with two parallel groups. Both groups received standard treatment including Weber's douche and symptomatic medicine on therapeutic grounds. Isotonic sea salt solution was applied four times daily for 10 days. The intervention group received Sinupret{\textregistered} syrup three times daily as add-on therapy. Using a five-point scale (0–4 points) the physicians evaluated the following symptomatic parameters within four successive visits (Day 0, 5, 7, and 10): nasal congestion, nasal discharge, post-nasal drip, headache, and facial pain. Using a 11 -point scale (0–10 points), each patient gave a daily self-assessment of the following parameters from Day 1 to Day 10: rhinorrhoea, headache, and facial pain.ResultsIn total, 184 patients (mean age 8.1 years) were included. In accordance with physicians' assessment compared to saline irrigation alone, significant improvements were detected in three out of five symptomatic parameters under combined treatment including Sinupret{\textregistered} syrup as assessed by the physicians. The between-group differences in the severity of facial pain and headache were insignificant. The Sinupret{\textregistered} group also showed a trend to an antibiotic-sparing effect (2.17{\%} in the Sinupret{\textregistered} group vs. 5.26{\%} in the control group). Further, the frequency of the transition of viral rhinosinusitis to the post-viral phase tended to decrease (1.08{\%} in the Sinupret{\textregistered} group vs. 5.26{\%} in the control group). No adverse reactions to the herbal medicine occurred during the study period.ConclusionThe complex herbal medicine Sinupret{\textregistered} syrup alleviates effectively the symptoms of acute viral rhinosinusitis in children. Furthermore, the prescription of antibiotics was also reduced.},

abstract = {Surgical site infection (SSI) is an unfortunate and unpreventable complication of any surgical intervention including spinal surgery. Early deep SSI (EDSSI) after instrumented spinal fusion are particularly difficult to manage due to the implanted, and possibly infected, instrumentation. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review patients who underwent spinal surgery, investigate the rate of EDSSI, identify patient-related and surgery-related risk factors and to assess the effectiveness of continuous indwelling irrigation on the eradication of these infections. A total of 814 patients (319 women and 495 men) who underwent spinal surgery were enrolled. Mean age at the initial surgery was 57.4 years old. Infections that penetrated the deep fascia within 1 month after the initial operation were considered as EDSSI. The rate of EDSSI, causal organisms, infection management and resolution were studied. Furthermore, we examined the patient-related and the operation-related risk factors. An overall incidence of EDSSI of 1.1{\%} was found. In 177 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), two patients (1.1{\%}) developed EDSSI. In 28 patients receiving chronic haemodialysis (HD), two patients with infections (7.1{\%}) were identified, which was statistically significantly greater than the other patient populations. Both operative time and intraoperative blood loss were significantly greater in patients with EDSSI than in non-infected patients. Furthermore, the rate of EDSSI in patients undergoing instrumented spinal fusion (3.8{\%}) was significantly higher than that in the other patients. In the nine patients who developed EDSSI, the causal organisms were identified and treated by surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy and continuous indwelling surgical site irrigation. All infections resolved, and no recurrence has been observed at final follow-up. Removal of the instrumentation was required in only one patient. Based on our results, we believe that continuous surgical site irrigation is an effective adjunct in the surgical treatment for early SSI following spinal surgery. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The motivation for this review paper came from the developing countries where the economy is mostly dependent on agriculture and climate conditions. Based on current conditions and historical records, profitability in production farming depends on making a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each field while preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the development of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in the world can display them through an internet-enabled device. Development of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-effective and potentially productive and increases the efficiency through precision agriculture farming. Different limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed publications like the shortage of power in the field that can be solved by using a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same time using electricity. Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design system optimization. Problems related to transmission and radio range frequency can be solved by using a power class upgraded antenna.},

abstract = {This study reviews how mini-lysimeters have been used effectively to optimize irrigation control in container horticulture production. Lysimeters are devices that measure evapotranspiration (ET) from the water balance of a fixed soil volume. The primary components of lysimeter-controlled irrigation are load cell sensors, a multiplexer, a data logger, a controller, and solenoid valves. The two common mini-lysimeter systems are platform lysimeters and suspension lysimeters. In these systems, a bending-beam single-point load cell is fastened between two plates, and a container is placed directly on the top platform. Platform lysimeters are commonly used for smaller pot sizes, and suspension lysimeters have been used for large shade trees up to 2.8 m tall and weighing 225 kg. Mini-lysimeters have been used for decades to calibrate ET models and create on-demand irrigation control programs that replenish plant daily water use or maintain deficit conditions. Research has demonstrated that lysimeter-based irrigation can respond more effectively to seasonal and diurnal variations in water demand, increasing irrigation cycles when evaporative demand is high, and decreasing irrigation cycles when demand is low. A strength of these systems is that for containerized plants, such as nursery production systems, mini-lysimeters capture whole-plant water use, which presents a more holistic measure compared with soil moisture sensors or leaf moisture sensors.},

abstract = {West Africa's rice imports currently satisfy 70{\%} of the soaring local demand, worsening the food vulnerability of an increasingly urbanized population. Despite considerable rice-growing potential, lack of water control systems, access to improved seeds, agrochemicals and appropriate mechanization have resulted in modest production growth rates, unable to alter the region's dependency on imported rice. Governments aim to boost production with import duties and input subsidies. However, questions remain as to whether these policies enable the rice sector to respond to changing consumers preferences for high grade rice and to contribute to national economic growth. We present the results from a Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) on rice production in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Niger and under three water management systems: irrigation (public scheme), supplemented rain-fed (rainfall aided by autonomously-sourced water supplies) and purely rain-fed. Our results show that policy interventions in these West African countries (i.e., input subsidies and import taxes) did not significantly enhance the profitability of rice production to farmers due to the effect of market failures (limited capital access and non-competitive market for rice) and the low quality of local milled rice. The PAM results point strongly to the importance of improving rice quality and yields through more efficient water management and post-harvest handling/processing and targeted breeding to match consumers' preferences.},

abstract = {We developed a risk assessment of human salmonellosis associated with consumption of alfalfa sprouts in the United States to evaluate the public health impact of applying treatments to seeds (0–5‐log10 reduction in Salmonella) and testing spent irrigation water (SIW) during production. The risk model considered variability and uncertainty in Salmonella contamination in seeds, Salmonella growth and spread during sprout production, sprout consumption, and Salmonella dose response. Based on an estimated prevalence of 2.35{\%} for 6.8 kg seed batches and without interventions, the model predicted 76,600 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 15,400–248,000) cases/year. Risk reduction (by 5‐ to 7‐fold) predicted from a 1‐log10 seed treatment alone was comparable to SIW testing alone, and each additional 1‐log10 seed treatment was predicted to provide a greater risk reduction than SIW testing. A 3‐log10 or a 5‐log10 seed treatment reduced the predicted cases/year to 139 (95{\%} CI 33–448) or 1.4 (95{\%} CI {\textless}1–4.5), respectively. Combined with SIW testing, a 3‐log10 or 5‐log10 seed treatment reduced the cases/year to 45 (95{\%} CI 10–146) or {\textless}1 (95{\%} CI {\textless}1–1.5), respectively. If the SIW coverage was less complete (i.e., less representative), a smaller risk reduction was predicted, e.g., a combined 3‐log10 seed treatment and SIW testing with 20{\%} coverage resulted in an estimated 92 (95{\%} CI 22–298) cases/year. Analysis of alternative scenarios using different assumptions for key model inputs showed that the predicted relative risk reductions are robust. This risk assessment provides a comprehensive approach for evaluating the public health impact of various interventions in a sprout production system.},

abstract = {There are significant trade-offs associated with irrigation using untreated urban wastewater. From a river-basin perspective, wastewater irrigation is an important form of water and nutrient reuse; however, there are important water quality, environmental, and public-health considerations. The risks associated with this practice are increasingly recognized, both in terms of implications for public health, and impacts on the environment. Less well-recognized are the potential benefits from this discharge. In the water-short Guanajuato river basin in west-central Mexico, urban wastewater is a primary source of irrigation water and nutrients for small farmers. The 140 hectares of land irrigated with raw wastewater downstream of the city of Guanajuato serve as a de facto water treatment facility. The City is currently considering construction of a wastewater treatment plant. IWMI research assessed the benefits of the wastewater to farmers and the health and environmental risks associated with the practice. This initial study suggests that continued application of the wastewater to the land would be a much more economical form of wastewater treatment. This conclusion is drawn with the caveat that the potential for serious negative impacts for health and the environment should be evaluated in an ongoing monitoring program.},

@phdthesis{Paudel2010,
abstract = {Sediment transport in irrigation canals The sediment transport aspect is a major factor in irrigation development as it determines to a large extent the sustainability of an irrigation scheme, particularly in case of unlined canals in alluvial soils. Investigations in this respect started since Kennedy published his channel-forming discharge theory in 1895. Subsequently different theories have been developed and are used around the world. All of them assume uniform and steady flow conditions and try to find the canal dimensions that are stable for a given discharge and sediment load. In the past irrigation schemes were designed for protective purposes with very little flow control, hence steady and uniform flow conditions could be realised to some extent. Modern irrigation schemes are increasingly demand based, which means that the water flow in a canal is determined by the crop water requirements. Accordingly the flow in the canal network is not constant as the crop water requirement changes with the climate and the growing stages of the crops. Also the inflow of the sediment is not constant throughout the irrigation season in most schemes. The situation is even worse for run-of-the-river schemes where fluctuations in the river discharge have a direct effect on the inflow of water and sediment. The conventional design methods are not able to predict accurately the sediment transport behaviour in a canal, firstly due to the unsteady and non-uniform water flow conditions and secondly due to the changing nature of the sediment inflow. Hence, the actual behaviour of a canal widely diverges from the design assumptions and in many cases immense maintenance costs have to be met with to tackle the sediment problems.An irrigation scheme should not only be able to deliver water in the required amount, time and level to the crops on the field, but also should recover at least its operation and maintenance cost. Cost recovery is, to some extent, related to the level of service provided by the irrigation organization and the expenditure for operation and maintenance of the scheme. Past experiences in Nepal have shown that modernization of existing irrigation schemes to improve the level of service has also increased the operation and maintenance costs. These costs are, in some cases, high compared to the generally low level of ability of the water users and farmers to pay these costs. The search of making schemes more equitable, reliable and flexible has resulted in the introduction of new flow control systems and water delivery schedules that may, if not carefully designed, adversely affect the sediment transport behaviour of a canal. In quite some schemes unpredicted deposition and/or erosion in canals have not only increased the operation and maintenance costs but also reduced the reliability of the services delivered. Irrigation development in Nepal and the study area Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia lying between China and India. It is situated between 26{\textordmasculine}22' N to 30{\textordmasculine}27' N latitude and 80{\textordmasculine}4' E to 88{\textordmasculine}12' E longitude of the prime meridian. Roughly rectangular in shape, the country has an area of 147,181 km2. It is 885 km in length but its width is uneven and increases towards the West. The mean North-South width is 193 km. Nepal is a predominantly mountainous country, with elevations ranging from 64 m+MSL (Mean Sea Level) at Kechana, Jhapa to 8,848 m+MSL at the peak of the world highest mountain, Everest, within a span of 200 km. Nepal has a cultivated area of 2.64 million ha, of which two third (1.77 million ha) is potentially irrigable. At present 42{\%} of the cultivated area has some sort of irrigation, out of which only 41{\%} is receiving year round irrigation water. The existing irrigation schemes contribute approximately 65{\%} of the country's current agriculture production. Nepal has a long history of irrigated agriculture. Most of the existing large-scale irrigation schemes are located in the southern alluvial plain (Terai). The canals are unlined and the sediment load forms an integral part of the supplied irrigation water. The schemes are predominantly supply based and have a very low duty for intensive cropping. In view of the increased competition among the different water using sectors and low performance of these schemes, many of them are undergoing modernization. For example, the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Scheme (SMIS) is one of the schemes under modernization, and it has been taken as a study case for this research. A better understanding of the sediment transport process under changing flow and sediment load conditions, a shifting management environment and different maintenance scenarios will be very useful in pulling out the schemes from the present vicious cycle of construction-deterioration-rehabilitation.The Sunsari Morang Irrigation Scheme (SMIS) is located in the eastern Terai. The Koshi River is the source of water. A side intake for the water diversion, an around 50 km long main canal of capacity 45.3 m3/s for water conveyance and 10 secondary canals and other minor canals of various capacities for water distribution were constructed to irrigate a command area of 68,000 ha. The system was put into the operation in 1975, but faced a serious problem of water diversion and sediment deposition in the canal network. Hence from 1978, after 3 years of operation, rehabilitation and modernization work of the scheme has been started. During modernization the intake has been relocated to increase the water diversion and reduce the sediment entry. Besides, a settling basin with dredgers for continuous removal of sediment has been provided near the head of the main canal. Apart from that the command area development and modernization of existing canal network is in progress and till third phase (1997-2002), around 41,000 ha area has been developed. Sediment transport research The aim of this research is to understand the relevant aspects of sediment transport in irrigation canals and to formulate a design and management approach for irrigation schemes in Nepal in view of sediment transport. In the process, the design methods used in the design of irrigation schemes in Nepal and their effectiveness on sediment transport have been studied. The impact of operation and maintenance on sediment movement has been analysed taking the case study of SMIS. An improved design approach for sediment transport in irrigation canals has been proposed. A mathematical model SETRIC has been used to study the interrelationship of sediment movement with the design and management and to evaluate the proposed design approach for irrigation canal based on the data of the SMIS. The mathematical formulation of sediment transport process in an irrigation canal is based on the previous works in this field, most notably the work of Mendez on the formulation of the mathematical model SETRIC. Subsequent analysis, improvement and verification works by Paudel, Ghimire, Orellana V., Via Giglio and Sherpa have been used. The model SETRIC has been verified and improved where found necessary and has been used to analyse the irrigation scheme and to propose an improvement in the design and management from sediment transport point of view. Assessment of design parameters The methods of selecting the design discharge and sizing of canals for modern irrigation schemes based upon the present concept of crop based irrigation demand, water delivery schedules and water allocation to the tertiary units have been analysed. The selection of a crop depends upon the soil type, water availability, socio-economic setting and climatic conditions. The type of crop together with the soil type determines the irrigation method and irrigation schedules, while the type of crop and climatic condition determines the irrigation water requirement. The required flow in a canal is then derived based on the water delivery schedule from that canal to the lower order canals or to the field to meet the water requirement. The factors that influence the roughness of an irrigation canal have been analysed and a proposal for a more rational roughness determination process has been formulated based on the available knowledge. The roughness in the sides depends upon the shape and size of material, vegetation and surface irregularities, while the roughness in the bed is a function of shape and size of material and the surface irregularities (bed form in case of alluvial canals). For the prediction of roughness in the bed mostly two approaches are in use – methods based on hydraulic parameters (water depth, flow velocity and bed material size) and the methods based on bed forms and the grain related parameters. In this research, the method based on the bed form and grain related parameters, as suggested by van Rijn, has been used. Similarly, for the determination of roughness in the sides, the influence of surface irregularities have been included by dividing the maintenance condition as ideal, good, fair and poor and accordingly applying the correction to the standard roughness value for the type of material. The influence of vegetation has been accounted based on the concept of V.T. Chow. The various methods of computing the equivalent roughness have been compared and the method proposed by Mendez has been found to be better when tested with the Kruger data. Most of the sediment transport predictors consider the canal with an infinite width without taking into account the effects of the side walls on the water flow and the sediment transport. The effect of the side wall on the velocity distribution in lateral direction is neglected and therefore the velocity distribution and the sediment transport are considered to be constant in any point of the cross section. Under that assumption a uniformly distributed shear stress on the bottom and an identical velocity distribution and sediment transport is considered. Majority of the irrigation canals are non-wide and trapezoidal in shape with the exception of small and lined canals that may be rectangular. In a trapezoidal section the water depth changes from point to point in the section and hence the shear stress. The effect would be more pronounced if the bed width to water depth ratio (B-h ratio) is small. The change in velocity distribution in a canal in view of the change in boundary shear and water depth along the cross section has been analysed and evaluated with the field measurements. The change in velocity and shear stress in a canal section has been used to evaluate the influence of B-h ratio and side slope in the prediction of sediment transport capacity by selected predictors (Brownlie, Engelund-Hansen and Ackers-White). The evaluation with the available data set showed that the proposed correction improved the predictability for non-wide irrigation canals. Canal design approaches for sediment transport in Nepal For the design of canals having erodible boundary and carrying sediment loads two approaches are in practice, namely the regime method and the rational method. The regime design methods are sets of empirical equations based on observations of canals and rivers that have achieved dynamic stability. The rational methods are more analytical in which three equations, an alluvial resistance relation, a sediment transport equation and a width-depth relationship, are used to determine the slope, depth and width of an alluvial canal when the water and sediment discharges as well as the bed material size are specified. In Nepal, the design manuals of the Department of Irrigation recommend Lacey's regime equations and White-Bettess-Paris tables with the tractive force equations for the design of earthen canals carrying sediment. But in practice, there is no consistency in the design approaches that has been found to vary from canal to canal even within the same irrigation scheme. The use of Lacey's equation for computing the B-h ratio has generally resulted in wider canals. This is so, because flatter side slopes than predicted by the Lacey's equations are used from soil stability considerations. The White-Bettess-Paris tables are derived from alluvial friction equations of White, Bettess and Paris (1980) and sediment transport equations of Ackers and White (1973). No records regarding the use of this method for the design of canals was found and hence its performance in terms of sediment transport could not be verified. However, the Ackers and White sediment transport equations over-predicted the sediment transport capacity of a canal when tested with the SMIS data. The sediment load entering into the canals of SMIS is mostly fine (d50 {\textless} 0.2 mm) and most of the large scale irrigation schemes in Nepal have similar geo-morphological settings. That means that the White-Bettess-Paris tables will result in a canal with a flatter slope than actually required to carry the type of sediment prevailing in SMIS and other similar irrigation schemes of Nepal. Analysis showed that the Brownlie and Engelund and Hansen equations are more suitable for the type of sediment that has been found in SMIS. During the modernization, the secondary canals (S9 and S14) of SMIS have been designed by two different approaches. Secondary Canal S9 has been designed using Lacey's regime concept while Secondary Canal S14 has been designed using an energy approach. In the energy approach the erosion is controlled by limiting the tractive force and the deposition is controlled by ensuring equal or non-decreasing energy of the flow in the downstream direction. Both the canals have been evaluated for their sediment transport capacity for the prevailing sediment characteristics. The carrying capacities of both canals ({\~{}} 230 ppm) have been found to be less than the expected sediment load ({\~{}} 300 – 500 ppm) in the canal. The energy concept assumes that the sediment transport is proportional to the product of velocity and bed slope. The carrying capacity of the canal designed by this principle has been found to be variable along its length. It means that the sediment transport capacity is not only a function of bed slope and water depth as assumed in the energy concept. An improved approach for the design and management of irrigation canals In general the reliability of sediment transport predictors is low and at best they can provide only estimates. As per Vito A Vanoni (1975) a probable error in the range of 50-100{\%} can be expected even under the most favourable circumstances. There is no universally accepted formula for the prediction of sediment transport. Most of them are based upon laboratory data of limited sediment and water flow ranges. Hence they should be adjusted to make them compatible to specific purposes, otherwise the predicted results will be unrealistic. An improved rational approach has been proposed for the design of alluvial canals carrying sediment loads. To find the bed width, bed slope and water depth of a canal for a given discharge and sediment characteristics three equations, namely a sediment transport predictor (total load), resistance equation (Ch{\'{e}}zy) and a B-h ratio predictor are used.A canal design program DOCSET (Design Of Canal for SEdiment Transport) has been prepared for the improved approach including the above mentioned improvements. The program can also be used to evaluate the existing design for a given water flow and sediment characteristics. Basic features of the new approach are:  concept of dominant concentration. Instead of using the maximum concentration, the approach suggests to look for a concentration that results in net minimum erosion/deposition in one crop calendar year;  determination of roughness. The proposed method makes use of the elaborated and more realistically determined roughness value in the design process. The roughness of the cross section is adjusted as per the hydraulic condition and sediment characteristics. Moreover the influences of the side slopes and the B-h ratio are included while computing the equivalent roughness of the section. This should result in a more accurate prediction of hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of the canal and hence, a better design;  explicit use of sediment parameters. The sediment concentration and representative size (dm) is explicitly used in the design. That will make the design process more flexible as different canals might have to divert and convey sediment loads of different sizes (dm) and amounts;  Use of an adjustment parameter. An adjustment parameter has been used that includes the influence of non-wide canals, sloping side walls and exponent of velocity in the sediment transport predictor. This adjustment should increase the accuracy of the predictors when they are used in irrigation canals, an environment for which they were not derived;  holistic design concept. This approach uses one canal system as a single unit. The canal system may have different canals of different levels, but the water and sediment management plans are prepared for the whole system. Then the hydraulic design of the individual canal can be made to meet the design management plan for that canal;  Selection of B-h ratio. A B-h ratio selection criterion has been proposed considering the side slope selection practices in Nepal as well as the sediment transport aspects. Since, the sediment transport process is influenced by the management of the irrigation scheme, the design should focus to have a canal that is flexible enough to meet the demand and still have a minimum deposition/erosion. The provision of sufficient carrying capacity up to the desired location (conveyance), providing controlled deposition options if the water delivery plans limit the transport capacity (provisions of settling pockets) and preparation of maintenance plans (desilting works) are some of the aspects that would have to be analysed and included in the design to reduce the sediment transport problems. The canal design methods can give the best possible canal geometry for a given water flow and sediment concentration only. For water flows and sediment concentrations other than the design values, there may be either erosion or deposition. The aim of the design would have to be to balance the total erosion and deposition in one crop calendar year. So, a design may not be based on the maximum sediment concentration expected during the irrigation season, but on a value that results in the minimum net erosion/deposition. The best way to evaluate a canal under such scenario is to use a suitable sediment transport model. Besides, the roughness of the canal depends upon the hydraulic conditions, sediment characteristics and the maintenance plans that are constantly changing throughout the irrigation season. The canals are designed assuming a uniform flow and sediment transport under equilibrium condition. However, such conditions are seldom found in irrigation canals due to the control in flow to meet the variation in water demand. Hence, the design of a canal would have to be evaluated using a sediment transport model for the selection of proper design parameters and to evaluate the design for the proposed water operation plans. The mathematical model SETRIC The mathematical model SETRIC is a one-dimensional model, where the water flow in the canal has been schematised as a quasi-steady and gradually varied flow. This one dimensional flow equation is solved by the predictor-corrector method. Gallappatti's depth integrated model for sediment transport has been used to predict the actual sediment concentration at any point under non-equilibrium conditions. Galappatti's model is based on the 2-D convection-diffusion equation. The mass balance equation for the total sediment transport is solved using the modified Lax's method, assuming a steady condition of the sediment concentration. For the prediction of the equilibrium concentration one of the three total load predictors: Brownlie, Engelund and Hansen or Ackers and White methods can be used. The model SETRIC was evaluated using other hydrodynamic and sediment transport models (DUFLOW and SOBEK-RIVER) and was validated by the field data of SMIS. Predictability of different predictors has been compared. The Brownlie and Engulund and Hansen methods predicted reasonably for the sediment size of 0.1 mm (d50), while predictability of Ackers and White for the sediment size was found to be poor. The sensitivity of Brownlie's method was more uniform than the other two methods for a sediment size range of 0.05 to 0.5 mm. Field data collection For the field measurements of the sediment transport process, one of the secondary canals of SMIS (S9) was selected. Since, the objective of field data was to test the design approach for sediment transport; preference was given for a canal that was recently designed and constructed. The field measurement of water and sediment flow was carried out in 2004 and 2005. During field measurements the water inflow rate into Secondary Canal S9 system was measured. A broad crested weir immediately downstream of the intake for Secondary Canal S9 was calibrated and used for discharge measurement. For sediment concentration measurements, dip samples just downstream of the hydraulic jump were taken on a daily basis. The samples were then analysed in the laboratory and the sediment concentration was determined. Point sampling across the section using pump samplers were also taken and the calculation results showed that the dip samples underestimated pump samples by around 8{\%} in case of the total load and by around 35{\%} for the sediment of size {\textgreater} 63 $\mu$m. At the end of the irrigation season, the deposited sediment samples along the canal were taken to determine the representative sediment size and other properties. The irrigating water delivered to the sub-secondary canals, delivery schedules and the set-points upstream of water level regulators were also measured. For morphological change, the pre-season and post-season canal geometry was measured. The velocity distribution in the trapezoidal earthen canal section was measured. Besides, field measurement roughness (indirect measurement) was also made in the beginning, mid and end of the seasons to determine the change in roughness in time. Modelling results The model SETRIC was used to study the effect on the sediment transport process due to system management activities namely, change in water demand and supply, water delivery modes based on the available water and the change in sediment load due to the variation in sediment inflow from the river or problems in proper operation of the settling basin. For the design water inflow into Secondary Canal S9, a water delivery schedule has been designed and has been evaluated for sediment transport efficiency under changing sediment inflow conditions. The improved canal design approach was evaluated comparing the results with the existing design of Secondary Canal S9. Some of the findings of the modelling results are:  water delivery schedules can be designed and implemented to reduce the erosion/deposition problems of a certain reach even after the system is constructed and put into operation;  the design operation plans and assumptions have not been followed in Secondary Canal S9 of SMIS. From sediment transport perspective, the existing water management practice results more sedimentation in the sub-secondary and tertiary canals than Secondary Canal S9;  the periodic change in the demand and the corresponding change in sediment transport capacity of the canal can be manipulated to arrive at the seasonal balance in the sediment deposition. In one period, there may be deposition but that can be eroded in the next period;  the proposed water delivery plan is based on the existing canal and its control structures and covers discharge fluctuation from around 46{\%} to 114{\%}. Hence, it can be implemented with the present infrastructure and can handle all possible flow situations in the canal;  the proposed delivery schedule ensures either full supply or no supply to the sub-secondary canals which have been designed for the same principle. This could reduce the existing deposition problem faced by these canals;  proper operation of the settling basin is crucial for the sustainability of the SMIS;  the secondary canals need to be operated in rotation when there is less demand or less available water in the main canal. This will ensure design flow in the secondary canals and reduce the sedimentation problem. The main canal would have to be analysed for the best mode of rotation from sediment transport and water delivery perspective. Major contributions of this research Apart from the recommendations made in the design, management and operation of Secondary Canal S9 from sediment transport perspective, the following contributions are made by this research:  an elaborate analysis of the velocity and shear stress distribution across the trapezoidal canal is made to derive the correction factor for the sediment transport predictor. This will help to increase the predictability when the predictors are used for the analysis of sediment transport in irrigation canals;  an explicit method of including roughness parameters in the calculation of the equivalent roughness for the mathematical model has been proposed;  the sediment transport model SETRIC has been updated and its functionality has been improved. The model can now be used as a design as well as research tool for analyzing the sediment transport process for different water delivery schedules and control systems;  an improved approach for the design and management of irrigation canals has been proposed. A computer program DOCSET has also been prepared based on the approach. The program is interactive, easy to use and can be used by designers with limited modelling know-how;  a water delivery plan has been designed and tested for the changing water and sediment inflow condition that can be implemented with the existing canal infrastructure;  the causes of sedimentation in the sub-secondary canals of Secondary Canal S9 have been identified. Conclusions and outlook for the future Canal design is an iterative process where the starting point is the preparation of management plans. Then the design parameters need to be selected and the preliminary hydraulic design of the canal can be made. The design results can then be used in the model to simulate and evaluate the proposed management plans and the sediment transport process in the system. Necessary adjustment can be made either in the design parameters or in the management plans, if needed. Then the canal need to be redesigned and the process would have to be continued till a satisfactory condition is reached. The coarser fraction of the sediment is mostly controlled at the headwork and settling basin of an irrigation scheme. The sediment that is encountered in main and secondary canals is generally fine sand. Most of the silt fraction (sediment {\textless} 63 $\mu$m) is transported to the lower order canals and fields where it gets deposited. In the sub-secondary and tertiary canals, it has been observed that the fine sediment does not roll down to the bed as normally assumed in the case of sand and gets deposited on the slope also. Thus the canal section becomes narrower and the side slope becomes steeper. This phenomenon can not be analysed with the present sediment transport assumptions and an investigation in this aspect to address the transport process of fine sediment would be beneficial for improving the design and management of irrigation canals. Flexibility of operation and sediment transport aspects restrict each other. A canal without any control can be designed and operated with higher degree of reliability in terms of sediment transport. Once the flow is controlled the sediment transport pattern of the canal is changed and the designed canal will behave differently. Hence, both flexibility and efficient sediment management are difficult to achieve at the same time. A compromise has to be made and this needs to be reflected in the design. All the methods to transport, exclude or extract the sediment are temporary measures and just transfer the problem from one place to the other. They are not the complete solutions of the sediment problem. A better understanding on sediment movement helps to identify the problems beforehand and look for the best possible solutions.},

abstract = {This study seeks to expand the current literature of the impacts of technology adoption for smallholder farmers. It does so through an empirical investigation of the relationship between micro-irrigation technology investment, farmer-group enrollment and five key income and crop-production indicators of smallholder farmer-households in four rural Zambian regions. Micro-irrigation technologies were purchased by farmer-households, and were not randomly assigned. As such, the paper utilizes a propensity-score matching methodology to reduce self-selection bias, thereby estimating the causal effects of micro-irrigation technology investment on household incomes and crop production. By stratifying the sample, impacts were estimated for six combinations of treatment using three distinct matching algorithms. Regional and gender-specific treatment effects were estimated for the impact of farmer-group enrollment with micro-irrigation investment, and for the incremental impact of micro-irrigation investment when the farmer-household is already enrolled in a farmer-group. The study finds robust and positive effects of micro-irrigation investment and farmer-group enrollment on total crop incomes and total crop revenues, for the whole sample. Regional impacts of technology investment are less robust because of sample size limitations, but remain positive and significant in two of the four intervention areas. Female- and male-headed households both had positive and robust impacts on crop incomes, but female-headed household treatment effects were larger in magnitude. The findings of this study suggest that investment in micro-irrigation technologies and enrollment in a farmer-group lead to higher crop incomes for smallholder farmers in Zambia, and may reduce gender gaps in farmer earnings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDThis review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve patient symptoms.OBJECTIVESTo evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.SEARCH METHODSThe Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015.SELECTION CRITERIARandomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means (douche, irrigation, drops, spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.MAIN RESULTSWe included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2{\%}) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period; the other compared 5 ml nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps.Disease-specific HRQL was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95{\%} CI 9.63 to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity was evaluated using a "single-item sinus symptom severity assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented.No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23{\%} of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL was measured using SF-12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10.5 points, 95{\%} CI 0.66 to 20.34) (very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had less severe symptoms (MD -13.50, 95{\%} CI -14.44 to -12.56); this corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSThe two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDAcute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation, and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and mucolytic drugs, and often antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for chronic or allergic sinusitis, but little is known about its effect on acute URTIs.OBJECTIVESTo evaluate the efficacy of saline nasal irrigation in treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.SEARCH STRATEGYWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1974 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), AMED (1985 to 2009) and LILACS (May 2009).SELECTION CRITERIARandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo review authors (DK, GS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager software.MAIN RESULTSThree RCTs (618 participants) were included. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, there was limited evidence of benefit with nasal saline irrigation in adults. One study showed a mean difference of 0.3 day (out of eight days) for symptom resolution, but this was not significant. Nasal saline irrigation was associated with less time off work in one study. Minor discomfort was not uncommon and 40{\%} of babies did not tolerate nasal saline drops.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSIncluded trials were too small and had too high a risk of bias to be confident about the possible benefits of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Future trials should involve much larger numbers of participants and be rigorously designed and controlled.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDAcute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and decongestant drugs and sometimes antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms despite a relative lack of evidence for benefit in this clinical setting. This review is an update of the Cochrane review by Kassel et al, which found that saline was probably effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms associated with acute URTIs.OBJECTIVESTo assess the effects of saline nasal irrigation for treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.SEARCH METHODSWe searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 5, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), CINAHL (1982 to August 2014), AMED (1985 to August 2014) and LILACS (1982 to August 2014).SELECTION CRITERIARandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo review authors (DK, BM) independently assessed trial quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and extracted data. We analysed all data using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Due to the large variability of outcome measures only a small number of outcomes could be pooled for statistical analysis.MAIN RESULTSWe identified five RCTs that randomised 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). They all compared saline irrigation to routine care or other nose sprays, rather than placebo. We included two new trials in this update, which did not contribute data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Most trials were small and we judged them to be of low quality, contributing to an unclear risk of bias. Most outcome measures differed greatly between included studies and therefore could not be pooled. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, one larger trial, conducted with children, did show a significant reduction in nasal secretion score (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.14) and nasal breathing (obstruction) score (MD -0.33, 95{\%} CI -0.47 to -0.19) in the saline group. However, a MD of -0.33 on a four-point symptom scale may have minimal clinical significance. The trial also showed a significant reduction in the use of decongestant medication by the saline group. Minor nasal discomfort and/or irritation was the only side effect reported by a minority of participants.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSNasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs. However, the included trials were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, reducing confidence in the evidence supporting this. Future trials should involve larger numbers of participants and report standardised and clinically meaningful outcome measures.},

abstract = {A primary means of increasing agricultural productivity to reduce global food insecurity is through intensification, including scaling irrigation measures (USAID, 2014). Aid agencies have strongly promoted agricultural intensification efforts to increase productivity and improve overall livelihoods. While scaling of irrigated agriculture has demonstrated significant boosts in productivity (ADB, 2013; Melaine {\&} Nonvide, 2017), agrarian transformation of the landscape through irrigated agricultural practices is associated with a number of water-related diseases (Hunter et al., 1993; Lacey {\&} Lacey, 1990; Mather {\&} That, 1984) including malaria (Ghebreyesus et al., 1999; Koudou et al., 2005; Oomen, De Wolf, {\&} Jobin, 1988). The government of Malawi established through the Green Belt Initiative (GBI) a long-term program aimed at land use modifications for the development of small and large-scale irrigation. While Malawians continue to face challenges directly related to food insecurity, the country is simultaneously holoendemic for malaria, wherein the disease is found in essentially all members of the population. This research investigates changes in disease dynamics of seasonal malaria cycles as a result of land transformation for irrigated agriculture using remote sensing and spatial analytical approaches. It is conducted against a backdrop of scaling up irrigated agricultural solutions across varying sectors, and myriad actors. To that end, the meaning of ‘scaling up' is analyzed across Research and Development (R{\&}D) institutions and a conceptual framework of scaling up was constructed to promote ontological agreement of scaling up from defining programs through to final evaluation of success. Three scenarios for estimated spatio-temporal distribution of suitable area for mosquito breeding pool formation and persistence were produced for the Bwanje Valley Irrigation Scheme (BVIS) using remotely sensed and field-based data. In addition, an estimation of habitat suitability during the dry season was produced for the 8-km area surrounding BVIS, the Bwanje Valley. Potential malaria transmission at the national scale driven by the GBI is presented through analysis of the current extent of irrigated agriculture, proposed expansion, and historic malaria prevalence data assessed by the 2012, 2014, and 2017 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in combination with the results of a habitat suitability model generated in Google Earth Engine. The conclusions from this study provide a strong foundation for agricultural land use decision making with respect to malaria transmission across Malawi.},

abstract = {The effect of irrigation on soft scald (SS) disorder in Ambrosia™ apples was surveyed over 4 years in various orchards in Cawston, BC which is located in a valley having a semiarid eco-zone. The observations were further validated by manipulating irrigation programs in a series of experiments in three commercial orchards. Adequate irrigation (AI) was defined as the amount of water application required to maintain sustainable production as defined in the provincial irrigation guide, while deficit irrigation (DI) reduced irrigation to less than 40{\%} of AI at the same site. Records from the survey study indicated that SS incidence was negatively correlated with the amount of watering (r = −0.9). The validation study confirmed that correlation at three different commercial sites. These results suggest that intensive water deficit can cause fruit to be susceptible to SS and that adequate watering during fruit expansion and late season exerts a mitigating effect on SS in Ambrosia™ apples grown in a dry climate region. They also suggest that conducting DI prior to midsummer does not irrevocably cause SS susceptibility in this apple.},

abstract = {Selenium was recognized as an important aquatic contaminant following the identification of widespread deformities in waterfowl at the agricultural drainage evaporation ponds of the Kesterson Reservoir (California) in 1983. Since then, California has been the focal point for global research and management of Se contamination. We analyzed the history and current developments in science, policy, and management of irrigation-induced Se contamination in California. In terms of management, we evaluated the effects of improvements in the design of local attenuation methods (drainage reuse and evaporation ponds) in conjunction with the development of programs for Se load reductions at the regional scale (namely the Grassland Bypass Project). In terms of policy, the USEPA is currently working on site-specific water quality criteria for the San Francisco Bay Delta that may be a landmark for future legislation on Se in natural water bodies. We provide a critical analysis of this approach and discuss challenges and opportunities in expanding it to other locations such as the Salt{\'{o}}n Sea. Management lessons learned in California and the novel policy approach may help prevent future events of Se contamination. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {A seasonal furrow irrigation model based on the concept of a comprehensive irrigation system is implemented using a Visual Basic program, OPTIMEC (EConomic OPTIMization in Spanish). From a set of climatological, soil, furrow geometry and crop data for sloping and run-off free furrows, OPTIMEC determines a quasi-optimum irrigation season calendar based on economic profit maximization. The model features four components: a soil moisture model, an irrigation hydraulic model, a crop yield model and an economic optimization module. This module uses a heuristic technique, the genetic algorithm (GA), to find a quasi-global optimum combination of irrigation events (defined by irrigation date, cut-off time and inflow rate) that maximizes net profit. GAs are based on the laws of natural selection and can be applied to many complex problems that are difficult to solve using traditional techniques. The problem stated herein is to find the best combination of weekly irrigation events during the season. A maximization approach based on traditional optimization technique is not easy due to the difficulties in establishing an explicit function relating profit, water depth and flow rate. This disadvantage can be overcome using GAs. A field example is used to illustrate model options, particularly the analysis capabilities of the optimization approach.},

abstract = {A critical objective for any wastewater reuse program is to close the gap between supply of and demand for water and to minimize health and environmental hazards. Thus, the effects of treated effluent on crops, soils and community health must be considered carefully. When applying wastewater to soil-plant systems, it is to be noted that the passage of water through the soil reduces considerably the number of microorganisms carried out by the reclaimed wastewater. Nevertheless, there is a need to study the real rate of organism decay subject to water quality, soil and vegetable characteristics, and irrigation method. The aim of this work is to determine the fate of the fecal coliforms, coliphages F+ and CN13, and helminth eggs survival during the application of reclaimed wastewater in a vineyard orchard near the City of Arad (Israel) via onsurface and subsurface drip irrigation systems. Wastewater obtained from a stabilization pond, and soil samples were tested and an important decrease of microorganisms was reached in both cases, with the better values obtained with the sub-surface drip irrigation system.},

abstract = {Background: This work addresses the increasing prevalence of water scarcity. Droughts are projected to worsen as a result of climate change and urbanization, increasing the need for all sectors to reduce the amount of water used. Home landscape irrigation represents an important opportunity to reduce water use in the United States. Focus of the Article: This formative research study used social marketing techniques to estimate potential impact of irrigation water conservation behaviors, weight and prioritize the behaviors to guide behavior selection in the context of residential irrigation conservation. Research Objective: The objectives were to estimate (1) the potential impact of, (2) current adoption levels and likelihood of adoption of, and to (3) prioritize various landscape irrigation water conservation behaviors. Program Design/Approach: When addressing any issue, including water scarcity, identifying target behaviors is the first, foundational step for a successful social marketing campaign. This research focuses on formative social marketing research to inform local interventions designed to reduce the amount of water applied to residential yards across the United States. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: This study outlines a process to compare and prioritize water conservation behaviors with the goal of reducing residential landscape irrigation usage. We demonstrate a technique for obtaining this type of formative research, the lack of which can serve as a barrier to change agents promoting behaviors in any context. Methods: We employed a two-pronged quantitative survey research approach to collect technical experts' impact ranking and U.S. residents' current adoption levels and likelihood of adopting potential irrigation water conservation behaviors. The 14-member expert panel was selected using purposive and snowball sampling techniques, and the residential sample (N = 2601) was recruited using purposive sampling. Results: Mean weights ranged from −46.55 to 61.13. Singly considering impact, current adoption levels, or likelihood of adoption would result in a different behavior receiving priority for a campaign (eliminating irrigated areas in landscapes, installing smart irrigation controllers, and following local watering restrictions, respectively). However, when these values were considered together, installing drought-tolerant plants in the yard had the greatest overall weight. Limitations: A possible conceptual limitation of this case study was the national scope of our research. The findings provide valuable baseline data for behavior change practitioners working across the country, and it is advisable to replicate this process at a local scale corresponding to the targeted intervention. Recommendations for Research or Practice: The findings underscore the importance of including technical experts and target audience members early in social marketing program planning and reveal the importance of systematically approaching behavior change selection to thoroughly consider different components of potential behaviors. Behavior change practitioners working on water issues can use the weights reported here to prioritize behaviors for targeted interventions, and those working in all areas can follow the process to prioritize behaviors at the local level. There are exciting opportunities to decompose likelihood into behavioral antecedents for both research and application. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract = {Doc number: 245   Abstract   Background: HIV/AIDS negatively impacts poverty alleviation and food security, which reciprocally hinder the rapid scale up and effectiveness of HIV care programs. Nyanza province has the highest HIV prevalence (15.3{\%}), and is the third highest contributor (2.4 million people) to rural poverty in Kenya. Thus, we tested the feasibility of providing a micro-irrigation pump to HIV-positive farmers in order to evaluate its impact on health and economic advancement among HIV-positive patients and their families.   Methods: Thirty HIV-positive patients enrolled in the Family AIDS Care and Education Services (FACES) program in Kisumu, Kenya were provided a micro-financed loan to receive an irrigation pump and farming guidance from KickStart, the developer of the pump. Economic data, CD4 counts, household health and loan repayment history were collected 12 months after the pumps were distributed.   Results: Mean annual family income increased by {\$}1,332 over baseline. CD4 counts did not change significantly. Though income increased, only three (10{\%}) participants had paid off more than a quarter of the loan.   Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of an income-generating micro-irrigation intervention among HIV-positive patients and the collection of health and economic data. While family income improved significantly, loan repayment rates were low- likely complicated by the drought that occurred in Kenya during the intervention period.},

abstract = {BackgroundSoft tissue abscesses are among the most frequently encountered medical problems treated by different surgeons. Standard therapy remains incision and drainage with sterile saline irrigation during postoperative wound healing period. Aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to compare sterile irrigation versus nonsterile irrigation.Study designA single center randomized controlled trial was performed to investigate postoperative wound irrigation. The control group used sterile irrigation, and the intervention group used nonsterile irrigation. Primary endpoints were reinfection and reintervention rates, assessed during follow-up controls for up to 2 years. Secondary endpoints were the duration of wound healing, inability to work, pain and quality of life.ResultsBetween 04/2016 and 05/2017, 118 patients were randomized into two groups, with 61 allocated to the control- and 57 to the intervention group. Reinfection occurred in a total of 4 cases (6.6{\%}) in the sterile protocol and 4 (7{\%}) in the nonsterile protocol. Quality of life and pain values were comparable during the wound healing period, and patients treated according to the nonsterile irrigation protocol used significantly fewer wound care service teams. Despite equal wound persistence rates, a substantially shorter amount of time off from work was reported in the nonsterile protocol group (p value 0.086).ConclusionThis prospective, randomized trial indicates that a nonsterile irrigation protocol for patients operated on for soft tissue abscesses is not inferior to the standard sterile protocol. Moreover, a nonsterile irrigation protocol leads to a shorter period of inability to work with comparable pain and quality of life scores during the wound healing period.},

@article{Ruhle2017,
abstract = {Background: Skin abscesses are a frequent encountered health care problem and lead to a significant source of morbidity. They consequently have an essential impact on the quality of life and work. To date, the type of aftercare for surgically drained abscesses remains under debate. This leads to undesirable practice variations. Many clinical standard protocols include sterile wound dressings twice a day by a home-care service to reduce the chance of a recurrent wound infection. It is unknown, however, whether reinfection rates are comparable to adequate wound irrigation with a nonsterile solution performed by the patient. Our hypothesis is that simple wound irrigation with nonsterile water for postoperative wound care after an abscess is surgically drained is feasible. We assume that in terms of reinfection and reintervention rates unsterile wound irrigation is equal to sterile wound irrigation. Objective: The primary aim of this study is therefore to investigate if there is a need for sterile wound irrigation after surgically drained spontaneous skin abscesses. Methods: In a prospective, randomized controlled, single-blinded, single-center trial based on a noninferiority design, we will enroll 128 patients randomized to either the control or the intervention group. The control group will be treated according to our current, standard protocol in which all patients receive a sterile wound irrigation performed by a home-care service twice a day. Patients randomized to the intervention group will be treated with a nonsterile wound irrigation (shower) twice a day. All patients will have a routine clinical control visit after 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks in the outpatient clinic. Primary outcome is the reinfection and reoperation rate due to insufficient wound healing diagnosed either at the outpatient control visit or during general practitioner visits. Secondary outcome measures include a Short Form Health Survey, Visual Analog Scale, Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Vancouver Scar Scale, and the EurolQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire. Those questionnaires will be completed at the outpatient control visits. Results: The trial was started in June 2016 and enrolled 50 patients by article publication. Regarding the adherence to our protocol, we found 10{\%} of loss to follow-up until now. Only 2 patients needed reoperation and only 1 patient needed a change of treatment (antiseptic therapy). Most patients are happy with their randomized treatment but as expected some patients in the sterile group complained about timing problems with their working hours and home-care service appointments. Most patients in the nonsterile group are satisfied being able to take care of their wounds independently although some patients still depend on the home-care service for the wound dressing. We are hoping to have enrolled enough patients by summer 2017. The follow-up will take until autumn 2017, and study results are expected to be published by the end of 2017. This trial is solely supported by the cantonal hospital of Lucerne. Conclusions: Nonsterile wound irrigation is more likely to be carried out independently by the patient than sterile wound irrigation. Therefore, if nonsterile wound care shows comparable results in terms of reinfection and reintervention rates, patient independence in the aftercare of surgically drained abscesses will increase, patients can return to work earlier, and health care costs can be reduced. In a preliminary, conservative estimation of health care costs, an annual savings of 300,000 CHF will be achieved in our hospital.

abstract = {Surface and groundwater resources are often conjunctively used to cope with water scarcity in irrigated agriculture. Farmers in the dryland ecosystems of central Asia also utilize shallow groundwater in addition to surface water withdrawn from rivers. This study modelled groundwater dynamics in an irrigation and drainage network in Khorezm region, Uzbekistan. The system, characterized by a vast, unlined channel network used to convey water mainly for flood irrigation and an open drainage system, is typical of Central Asian irrigated areas. Groundwater levels in the region are shallow this contributes to crop water requirements but threatens crop production through secondary salinization. High losses during irrigation in fields and through the irrigation network are the main causes of these shallow groundwater levels. The main objective of this study was thus to simulate groundwater levels under improved irrigation efficiency scenarios. The FEFLOW-3D model, applied in a case study to the water users' association (WUA) of Shomakhulum in south-west Khorezm, was used to quantify the impact of improved irrigation efficiency scenarios on groundwater dynamics. The modelled scenarios were: current irrigation efficiency (S-A, our baseline), improved conveyance efficiency (S-B), increased field application efficiency (S-C), and improved conveyance and application efficiency (S-D). Recharge rates were separately determined for six hydrological response units (differing in groundwater level and soil type) and introduced into the FEFLOW-3D model. After successful model calibration (R² = 0.94) and validation (R² = 0.93), the simulations showed that improving irrigation efficiency under existing agro-hydroclimatic conditions would lower groundwater levels from the baseline scenario (S-A) in August (the peak irrigation period) on average by 12 cm in S-B, 38 cm in S-C and 44 cm in S-D. Any interventions which would improve irrigation efficiency will lower the groundwater levels and hence policy makers should consider them and formulate the policy accordingly.},

abstract = {An experiment was conducted to create a science-based program of irrigation and fertilizer application for two-year winter wheat under wide ridge and furrow irrigation in the Yellow River irrigation area. The study was performed in a test field located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China. A numerical model of soil water and nitrogen transport for winter wheat under wide ridge and furrow irrigation was created using HYDRUS-2D. The behavior of soil water and nitrogen was predicted for different irrigation water and nitrogen treatments and analyzed to identify pathways of nitrogen transport and transformation. The nitrogen balance was calculated for the different water and nitrogen treatments. The coefficients of determination for measured and predicted values of soil water content, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen in both horizontal and vertical directions were all {\textgreater}0.68; the mean absolute error was {\textless}0.06; and the root mean square error was {\textless}0.1. These values indicate the feasibility of using a numerical model of nitrogen transport for wide ridge and furrow irrigation. The correlation coefficient R2 between simulated values of nitrogen uptake and measured values of total crop nitrogen content was 0.88, the RMSE value was 10.58 kg/ha, and the MAE value was 5.9 kg/ha. Nitrogen loss was primarily caused by denitrification, and the quantity of gaseous nitrogen loss was 7.05–38.2{\%} of the nitrogen form. The total quantity of ammonium nitrogen absorbed by winter wheat plant roots in each treatment was 7.6–15.1{\%} of the total amount of nitrate nitrogen absorbed. The maximum nitrogen uptake was 155.53 kg/ha with a yield of 6888.67 kg/ha at a nitrogen application rate of 220 kg/ha and irrigating to 70{\%} field capacity. The UE of the 220 kg/ha and irrigating to 70{\%} field capacity treatment was relatively high, the PFP of the 120 kg/ha and irrigating to 80{\%} field capacity treatment was relatively high, and the nitrogen use efficiency of the 320 kg/ha and irrigating to 60{\%} field capacity treatment was the lowest overall. This study provides a basis for investigating soil water and nitrogen transport mechanisms of winter wheat under wide ridge and furrow irrigation in the Yellow River irrigation area.},

abstract = {This paper describes the simulation results for continuous and surge flow irrigation under short field conditions by the computer model SIRMO IIID in order to evaluate the performance and applicability of the model for short furrows and to investigate the viability of the two-point method for calculating infiltration parameters under continuous and surge flow irrigation in short fields. These specific field conditions are found on farms smaller than 1 ha and with a furrow length of 70 m. To evaluate the model a series of experiments has been carried out in two locations in Egypt and in one site in the Netherlands. The experiments in Egypt were conducted on a field with clay soil situated at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, and on a sandy soil field located at the Assiut University Experimental Station for Desert Land, El- Wadi El-Assuity, Assiut. The experiments in the Netherlands were carried out at the Tunnel Experimental Setting of the Irrigation and Water Engineering Group of Wageningen University. The tunnel was covered as a greenhouse to protect the investigations against the external weather conditions, especially rainfall. Two soil types were available inside the tunnel, namely sandy clay and sandy clay loam. All the experiments were carried out in furrows with a blocked end and their length and width were 70 and 0.70 m, respectively. Measured field data were used to evaluate the computer model SIRMO IIID. The results of the evaluation indicated that the model can accurately simulate continuous and surge flow irrigation under short field conditions for the measured infiltration parameters. These field data are very important for a good simulation of the advance time and consequently the infiltration. The two-point method can be successfully used to obtain the infiltration parameters for continuous and surge flow irrigation under short field conditions and for different soil types.Original Abstract: Cet article presente les resultats de simulation de l'irrigation en continu et par intermittence en situation de parcelles reduites par le programme SIRMO IIID (Surface Irrigation Computer Simulation Model). le but est d'evaluer les performances et l'applicabilite du modele dans le cas des raies d'irrigation courtes, et d'evaluer la viabilite de la methode des deux points pour calculer les parametres d'infiltration en condition d'irrigation gravitaire en continu et en intermittence sur de petites parcelles. Ces conditions specifiques sont rencontrees dans des parcelles de moins d'un hectare et dont la longueur des raies est de 70 m comme c'est le cas en Egypte. Afin d'evaluer le modele, une serie d'experimentations a ete conduite dans deux sites en Egypte et dans un site aux Pays-Bas. Les sites en Egypte sont la station d'experimentation agricole de l'Universite d'Asyut, avec un sol de type argileux, et la station experimentale des zones arides de l'Universite El-Wadi El-Assuity, Asyut, avec un sol de type sablonneux. Les experimentations au Pays-Bas ont ete conduites dans le tunnel experimental de l'Universite de Wageningen, au Departement d'Irrigation. le tunnel est couvert comme une serre pour l'isoler des conditions climatiques exterieures, principalement la pluie. Deux types de sol, l'un A texture sablo-argileuse et l'autre A texture sablo-argilo-limoneuse, ont ete utilises dans le tunnel. Les raies, avec une longueur de 70 m et une largeur de 0.70 m, ont ete fermees A leurs bouts. Les donnees mesurees sur les sites ont ete utilisees pour evaluer le modele. Les resultats indiquent qu'A partir des donnees d'infiltration mesurees, SIRMO IIID realise une bonne simulation de l'irrigation en continu et par intermittence sur des parcelles de dimensions reduites. Il est recommande d'utiliser les parametres d'infiltration mesures comme donnees pour le modele SIRMOD afin d'obtenir la meilleure simulation du temps de progression de la lame d'eau et par consequent de l'infiltration. La methode des deux points pourrait etre utilisee efficacement pour calculer les parametres d'infiltration pour l'irrigation gravitaire en continu et en intermittence sur de petites parcelles et pour differents types de sol.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on smallholders' perceptions of environmental variability and its impacts, their responses, and the role of Water Users' Associations (WUA) in governing the irrigation system in response to observed environmental changes. Our research recognizes that farmers' adaptations emerge from placed-based experience, yet adaptation policy and programmes may not recognize the heterogeneity of place-based experience. Fifteen farmer-managed irrigation systems from five districts of Nepal were selected as research sites, representing different ecological regions. Data were collected from household surveys and key informant interviews; the quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Our study reveals that the perception of environmental change differs across the ecological gradients and irrigators' physical position along the irrigation canals. Labour scarcity, investment in technology, access to non-farm income, information on environmental variability, and sociodemographic factors also influence irrigators' perceptions. Irrigators responded by adjusting irrigation amounts, improving irrigation infrastructure and altering irrigation rules, and using local knowledge and technology. WUA assist irrigators by mobilizing labour for canal maintenance, managing water distribution, monitoring irrigation systems, and collecting service fees. Our finding supports policy initiatives that recognize the importance of WUA, the differential and situated experience of climate risk, and the need for place-specific adaptation options for Nepalese farmers.},

abstract = {Millions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia benefit from readily available and affordable irrigation technologies. The rapid uptake of small private irrigation in South Asia had a proven positive effect on poverty alleviation. In sub-Saharan Africa similar trends are emerging and several studies point to considerable upscaling potential. Achieving this potential would substantially boost smallholder incomes and food security. However, the spread of small private irrigation poses several challenges related to equity, efficiency, and sustainability. Women and resource poor farmers face challenges accessing affordable technologies; market inefficiencies and policy frameworks negatively affect farmer decision-making and technology access; and the unregulated spread of private irrigation may lead to over-abstraction, pollution, and conflicts. In this paper we argue that carefully designed intervention strategies and policy engagement are needed for two reasons. First, there is a need to address potential adverse effects of the ongoing, unregulated spread of small private irrigation while safeguarding its proven benefits on food security and poverty alleviation. Second, relatively straightforward measures can extend the benefits to a broader group of smallholders, including women and the poor, while at the same time ensuring sustainable use of the resource. Based on empirical evidence from case studies in six countries, we identified four elements of such an approach: (1) enhancing technology access; (2) catalyzing smallholder value chains; (3) fostering supportive policies; and (4) strengthening institutional capacity to manage potential trade-offs at the watershed scale.},

abstract = {Irrigation stimulates agricultural productivity and economic growth, but this may come at the cost of growing inequality. Using data at community and household level, this paper analyzes the distributional impacts of irrigation in Ethiopia. Regression analyses reveal the direct effects of irrigation on expenditures and labour demand, and the indirect effects of irrigation on food prices and expenditures of non-irrigation households. The results indicate that past development of irrigation stimulated growth without deepening inequality, and that irrigation decreased dependence on food-for-work programs. Thus, irrigation has played a positive role in the development of Ethiopia. Reprinted by permission of Frank Cass {\&} Co. Ltd.},

Taking as a starting point the analyses and of the IWMI-FAO-ADB study on Revitalizing Asia$\backslash$u2019s Irrigation and its key strategies, the paper compares atomistic irrigation, traditional small-scale and large-scale irrigation options, outcomes and potentials in their socio-economic and river basin environments. Atomistic irrigation has exploded, river basins are closing and energy prices are soaring. This new reality, its benefits, its sustainability crisis, but also the potential for new strategies that this phenomenon has demonstrated must first be acknowledged.|In most countries and river basins, additional development of irrigation at whatever scale is not an option and the focus will be on improving the productivity and sustainability of existing systems. In areas where irrigation development is still possible, options remain open. Demography, market pull, water constraints and energy will largely determine the mix of atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation and their evolution, expansion and decline over time.|The paper explores tactics and strategies for the modernization of existing and the potential for new large-scale systems and for supporting and sustaining atomistic and small-scale irrigation, institutional and policy innovations, and tools to facilitate dynamic planning and management of the sector, the evolution of different systems and the design of measures to support an enabling environment.|A considerable body of knowledge exists on how to support these strategies, transform large-scale irrigation systems and promote various forms of atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation systems. Tools that support long-term sectoral planning and management for future investment and the design of measures to support an enabling environment are proposed. The deployment of sound water accounting and auditing systems will be critical. Planning and policy mechanisms will require looking outside the irrigation sector and this is often where effective interventions will be found.|We need to move from competition and conflict between atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation to a fluid logic of complementarily, combination and convergence. For this to happen, the virtual reality of official agency outlooks, imported frameworks, and descriptions of the sectors and the basins will often need to be reformed, as a preliminary to the reform of the institutions and programmes that embody them. Then, the mobilization of resources from the public sector, the private sector and water users can be greatly enhanced and result in positive outcomes and more sustainable results, and enable new solutions to old problems that have long nagged the sector.|Changing the outlook of the sector and effecting the necessary structural and policy reforms, which are required to change decision-making on future investments in the sector will be difficult. Capacity building and changing practice and results on the ground, together with the adoption of robust monitoring and evaluation systems for investment and policy results, can serve as a basis for developing a broad constituency to effect the changes in governance and policy that will ultimately be needed, and assist in shaping investment to facilitate these changes.},

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue: Water and Food   In Japan, a developed country in Asia, the Land Improvement Act systems have worked as a measure of social capital accumulation as well as an adjective law in implementing irrigation projects since 1949. This paper illustrates the status and problems in applying the concept of social capital to agricultural and rural development policy systems in developing countries, EU and Japan. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) it is desirable that governments formulate public policies that are appropriate for correcting inefficiencies in resource distribution for accumulating social capital, so that the governments play a significant role in developing and supporting social capital; (2) the effect of policies in the areas, where government-supported land improvement projects have been implemented, has been improved, subsequent to which the efficient use of the national budget allocated for the projects has been improved, while the projects significantly contribute to the national land conservation and social stability by continuously promoting minimum social capital accumulation nationwide. In addition, Japan and countries in the Asian monsoon region, which hold the five elements in common that constitute the characteristics of rice field irrigation in humid climates, should take over the advantages of the land improvement project system while learning from the success achieved by the LEADER+ programme in Europe, where society precedes Asian countries concerning the problems of decline in the birth rate, and expansion of an aging society.

abstract = {Shortage in irrigation water has become a serious problem in rural China. Governments are trying to build more Water User Associations (WUAs) to improve the management of irrigation water. Better management would reduce the agricultural use of water and allocate more water to protect the environment, especially in arid and semi-arid areas where the ecological environment is very fragile. Therefore, it is important to know how WUAs have been organized, whether they have had contributions to water management, as well as how satisfied water users are. This report is among the first to characterize the situation of WUAs in northwest China. This report has three contributions. First, the report shows a relatively poor implementation of the reform to transfer management to WUAs in China. Many of the villagers did not even know that WUAs existed. The poor implementation of the reform program implies that water users were not officially entitled to the rights to manage these resources. Second, the report shows that the quality of local government was the main determinant of users' awareness on the existence of WUAs. This result implies that a more responsible government is needed to improve the efforts in implementing the reform or/and in transferring power to water users. Moreover, the awareness of users about the WUAs and the quality of government both had positive effects on the performance of WUAs. These combined facts suggest that a more responsible local government not only has direct positive contribution to the performance of WUAs, but that it also affects performance by increasing awareness among community members. Third, the coefficients of social capital and/or that of the interaction terms of social capital and awareness were significant in many of the regression models on the performance of WUAs and on the satisfaction of water users. The results suggest that social capital could affect the performance of WUAs. Considering that the coefficients of trust aggregated at the administrative village level were not significant in all the models, we can conclude that only the trust in the densely-connected community could be useful for community management. This result suggests that defining the boundary of common pool resources at the natural village level is very important for social capital to be effective.},

abstract = {Performance evaluation of irrigated agriculture is an important tool that assists in decision-making on water management in the river basin, particularly in tropical semiarid regions. This study was carried out using information from the Jaguaribe River basin, located in the Northeast region of Brazil, which has an important restriction in the availability of water resources and high competition for water use. From a set of indicators (production, water, economic, and social), the overall performance index of irrigated agriculture was estimated (ranging from zero to 1.0) for two scenarios: high water scarcity and low water scarcity. The performance index used was based on the mean value of these security criteria normalized with respect to the maximum value of the indicator for the crop obtained in the sub-basin. A low performance index of irrigated agriculture (less than 0.3) has always been associated with inadequacy of more than one security indicator. Crops with significant cultivated areas and, therefore, requiring a high volume of irrigation, such as rice, sugar cane, banana, and green coconut, require technical interventions related to the management of the soil–water–plant system aiming at improving yield with less water. Under conditions of water restrictions, crops with performance indexes higher than 0.3 should be prioritized. The study presented here for Jaguaribe River basin may support public policies related to irrigation and agronomic techniques necessary to improve the performance of agricultural under tropical dry lands.},

abstract = {Study Objective: To determine whether sub-diaphragmatic irrigation with sodium bicarbonate would relieve post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Design: Randomized double-blinded trial. Setting: Teaching hospital. Patients: Seventy patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) for benign indications. Intervention: We randomly allocated patients to intervention or control groups where sodium bicarbonate containing flushing liquid or normal saline was irrigated sub-diaphragm before sewing. Measurement {\&} Main Results: The primary outcome was PLSP following surgery measured by a numerical rating scale (NRS) (0 = no pain; 10 = worst pain imaginable). Secondary outcomes were abdominal incisional and visceral pain, analgesic use, and sodium bicarbonate related side effects. The incidence of PLSP in intervention group was significantly lower than that in control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Contrarily, incisional and visceral pain was similar in both groups (P = 0.1). The consumption of rescue analgesics in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group. Side effects were comparable in both study groups. Conclusion: Sub-diaphragmatic irrigation with sodium bicarbonate could effectively reduce shoulder pain, but not abdominal incisional and visceral pain, in patients undergoing TLH without an increase in side effects.

abstract = {Management practices are needed to reduce soil C losses from croplands converted from Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grassland. We evaluated the effects of irrigation, tillage, cropping system, and N fertilization on surface residue and soil organic C (SOC) at the 0- to 85-cm depth in relation to crop yields in a sandy loam soil from 2005 to 2011 in croplands converted from CRP in western North Dakota. Treatments were two irrigation practices (irrigated vs. nonirrigated) as the main plot and six cropping systems [CRP, conventional till malt barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with N fertilizer (CTBN), conventional till malt barley without N fertilizer (CTBO), no-till malt barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) with N fertilizer (NTB-P), no-till malt barley with N fertilizer (NTBN), and no-till malt barley without N fertilizer (NTBO)] as the split plot arranged in a randomized complete block with three replications. Soil surface residue amount and C content were greater in CRP and NTBN than the other cropping systems. At 0 to 5 cm, SOC was greater in irrigated CRP, but at 0 to 85 cm it was greater in nonirrigated NTBN than most other treatments. At 0 to 20 cm, SOC increased by 0.26 to 1.21 Mg C ha{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} yr{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} in NTB-P and CRP but decreased by 0.02 to 0.68 Mg C ha{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} yr{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} in other cropping systems. Surface residue C and SOC at 0 to 10 cm were related to annualized crop grain yield (R{\^{}}sup 2{\^{}} = 0.45-0.77, P ≤ 0.12, n = 10). Because of positive C sequestration rate and favorable crop yields, NTB-P may be used as a superior management option to reduce soil C losses and sustain yields in croplands converted from CRP in the northern Great Plains.},

abstract = {Management practices can influence soil CO sub(2) emission and C content in cropland, which can effect global warming. We examined the effects of combinations of irrigation, tillage, cropping systems, and N fertilization on soil CO sub(2) flux, temperature, water, and C content at the 0- to 20-cm depth from May to November 2005 at two sites in the northern Great Plains. Treatments were two irrigation systems (irrigated vs. non-irrigated) and six management practices that contained tilled and no-tilled malt barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) with 0 to 134 kg N ha super(-1), no-tilled pea (Pisum sativum L.), and a conservation reserve program (CRP) planting applied in Lihen sandy loam (sandy, mixed, frigid, Entic Haplustolls) in western North Dakota. In eastern Montana, treatments were no-tilled malt barley with 78 kg N ha super(-1), no-tilled rye (Secale cereale L.), no- tilled Austrian winter pea, no-tilled fallow, and tilled fallow applied in dryland Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls). Irrigation increased CO sub(2) flux by 13{\%} compared with non-irrigation by increasing soil water content in North Dakota. Tillage increased CO sub(2) flux by 62 to 118{\%} compared with no-tillage at both places. The flux was 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater with tilled than with non-tilled treatments following heavy rain or irrigation in North Dakota and 1.5- to 2.0-fold greater with crops than with fallow following substantial rain in Montana. Nitrogen fertilization increased CO sub(2) flux by 14{\%} compared with no N fertilization in North Dakota and cropping increased the flux by 79{\%} compared with fallow in no-till and 0 kg N ha super(-1) in Montana. The CO sub(2) flux in undisturbed CRP was similar to that in no-tilled crops. Although soil C content was not altered, management practices influenced CO sub(2) flux within a short period due to changes in soil temperature, water, and nutrient contents. Regardless of irrigation, CO sub(2) flux can be reduced from croplands to a level similar to that in CRP planting using no-tilled crops with or without N fertilization compared with other management practices.},

abstract = {The application of biosolids to cropping soils may improve soil health, supply nitrogen and other nutrients for crops. There are specific guidelines on the quantity of biosolids that can be applied to a soil to grow selected crops. However, some recommendations overlook environmental factors such as soil organic N and N supplied by irrigation water. We conducted a three‐year field monitoring programme to study the effect of biosolid application on sodicity, soil nitrogen and organic carbon status to a depth of 1.8 m in a vertisol with a history of sewage effluent water irrigation. Biosolid application had no effect on soil sodicity. Improvements in soil organic carbon (SOC) were short‐lived and occurred only during the first year. N accumulation and leaching below the root zone (1.2 m) occurred after two years and suggest a possible off‐farm environmental risk. The higher residual mineral N in biosolid treatment 2 years after application implies an opportunity to reduce N inputs in vertisols treated with biosolids and effluent water. The biosolid application rate of 35 Mg ha⁻¹ was well below the nitrogen‐limited biosolid application rate (NLBAR) (100 Mg ha⁻¹) under the current guidelines. This warrants further refinement of NLBAR to suit specific circumstances such as effluent‐enriched water irrigation and additional in‐crop fertilizer application.},

abstract = {Little is known about the microbial community structure associated with soil aggregation in microaggregates (0.25-0.05 mm) that are held within macroaggregates (0.25 mm). We investigated the effects of irrigation, tillage, and cropping system on aggregate distribution and the community structure of the predominant culturable bacteria in microaggregates held within macroaggregates from 2005 to 2008 at a site in western North Dakota. Managements were malt barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under no-till and conventional till and an established no-tilled Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) plantation on Lihen loam (sandy, mixed, frigid, Entic Haplustolls) under irrigated and dryland systems. We predicted that microaggregates held within macroaggregates of irrigated no-till barley and CRP management have a higher proportion of the predominant culturable bacterial species that have the capability to aggregate soil than in irrigated and nonirrigated conventional till barley managements. Fatty acid profiling and DNA sequencing were used to identify bacterial isolates and a soil sedimentation assay to determine their soil-aggregating ability. The proportion of soil aggregating Gram-negative bacteria, dominated by pseudomonads and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, was higher under irrigated no-till barley and CRP compared with the other managements. Species abundance and diversity of the soil-aggregating bacterial isolates were the highest in irrigated no-till barley and CRP and the lowest in irrigated conventional till barley. We demonstrated that, under irrigated management with high residue input, microaggregates held within macroaggregates represent a distinct environment that selects for specific soil-binding microbial communities that may contribute to soil structural stability at the 0- to 5-cm depth.},

abstract = {Vector-borne pathogens, such as Malaria, Dengue, West Nile and Zika virus, infect hundreds of millions of people each year and lead to widespread human morbidity and mortality, with enormous spatial and temporal variation in disease risk. The recent emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) into the developed world offers a unique opportunity to better understand ecological drivers that contribute to variation in disease risk, as a step toward more effective disease management through targeted interventions. In Chapter 1, we examined correlations between rice cultivation and WNV human disease incidence in rice-growing regions within the United States (US). We found WNV human disease incidence increased with the fraction of each county under rice cultivation in California, but not in the southern US. We show that this is likely due to regional differences in the mosquitoes transmitting WNV. These results illustrate how cultivation of particularly water-demanding agricultural crops can increase mosquito-borne disease risk and how spatial variation in vector ecology can alter the relationship between land cover and disease. In Chapter 2, we examined the effect of irrigation, climate and land cover on mosquito abundance and WNV human disease cases across California. Irrigation made up nearly a third of total water inputs to the region, with irrigation exceeding precipitation in some dry regions. Irrigation reduced seasonal variability in mosquito abundance by more than 40{\%}, and increased abundance by more than an order of magnitude. In addition, irrigation increased human WNV cases and explained 33{\%} of variation in WNV cases among California counties. These results suggest that irrigation can increase and decouple mosquito populations from natural precipitation variability, resulting in sustained and increased disease risk. In Chapter 3, we quantified the risk of WNV transmission to humans from 6 Culex mosquito species by integrating mosquito abundance, infection prevalence, vector competence, and blood feeding patterns, and examined correlations between risk indices and human disease cases. Human WNV cases were strongly correlated with the density of infectious vectors feeding on humans. However, different mosquito vector species contributed to transmission in different land use types and within seasons and across years. Culex tarsalis was more abundant in agricultural areas, whereas Culex pipiens and  Culex quinquefasciatus were abundant in developed and agricultural areas, and Culex erythrothorax was abundant in wetland areas. As a result, WNV risk did not change substantially along either agricultural or urbanization land use gradients because the diversity of vectors maintained high disease risk across a range of habitats. These results show how a diversity of vectors can maintain an ecosystem disservice - vector borne disease – by their differential response to environmental disturbance.},

abstract = {Multivariate statistical analysis and ArcGIS tools have been used to assess groundwater quality in the central part of Kuwait. The chemical data for groundwater samples collected from 71 bore wells are assessed to determine their suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes using the irrigation parameter indices. The WATEQ4F program is used to investigate the degree of saturation of groundwater with respect to the minerals calcite, dolomite, aragonite, halite, gypsum, magnesite, and brucite. In multivariate statistical analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and R-mode and Q-mode cluster analysis are used to classify the groundwater into different clusters. In the PCA, the cumulative variance percentages of the first three components are 89.5{\%}, expressed for four main chemical compounds, of which sodium chloride and sodium sulphate are the first principal component (PC1)compounds, with a variance of 65{\%}, followed by the carbonates and silicates in PC2 and PC3, which are 15{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively. The Q-mode cluster mean value analysis identified four distinct groundwater chemical types, in which cluster I is mainly NaCl and SiO2, followed by Na2SO4 in cluster II, and the concentration of HCO3− revealed that clusters III and IV were mainly carbonate groups. In addition, the TDS and the TH clusters' mean values decrease from cluster I to cluster IV, indicating that the quality of the groundwater improves sequentially from cluster I to cluster IV. The results reveal that the groundwater in the study area is not suitable for drinking, but it is suitable for irrigation purposes.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of using spectral reflectance indices (SRI) as an indirect selection tool to differentiate spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes for grain yield under irrigated conditions. This paper demonstrates only the first step in using the SRI as indirect selection criteria by reporting genetic variation for SRI among genotypes, the effect of phenology and year on SRI and their interaction with genotypes, and the correlations between SRI and grain yield and yield components of wheat. Three field experiments—15 CIMMYT globally adapted genotypes (GHIST), 25 random F3–derived lines (RLs1), and 36 random F3–derived lines (RLs2)—were conducted under irrigated conditions at the CIMMYT research station in northwest Mexico in three different years. Five previously developed SRI (photochemical reflectance index [PRI], water index [WI], red normalized difference vegetation index [RNDVI], green normalized difference vegetation index [GNDVI], simple ratio [SR]) and two newly calculated SRI (normalized water index-1 [NWI-1] and normalized water index-2 [NWI-2]) were evaluated in the experiments. In general, genotypic variation for all the indices was significant. Near infrared radiation (NIR)–based indices (WI, NWI-1, NWI-2) gave the highest levels of association with grain yield during the 3 yr of the study. A clear trend for higher association between grain yield and the NIR-based indices was observed at heading and grainfilling than at booting. Overall, NIR-based indices were more consistent and differentiated grain yield more effectively compared to the other indices. The results demonstrated the potential of using SRI as a tool in breeding programs for selecting for increased genetic gains for yield.},

abstract = {Stability of canals slopes are of paramount importance in engineering works due to its interaction with the infrastructure including roads networks and buildings. The failure of these slopes could cause human disaster, catastrophic environmental, and economic losses. The present study aims to investigate the stability of canals slopes considering the climate changes through sea level rise, fluctuation of groundwater level and the seismic actions. The study was simulated on the North Eastern part of Nile Delta aquifer, Egypt using the finite difference code of Visual MODFLOW. Moreover, the groundwater flow under the effect of sea level rise was investigated to study its effect on slope stability of El-Salam Canal, Egypt. Furthermore, the finite element program of Phase 2 was implemented, and safety factors were calculated using the shear strength reduction method (SSRM). The models are calibrated and verified through experimental work using permeability and seepage model. Moreover, the two models were applied on El-Salam Canal considering three scenarios to identify the safety factors including the effect of sea level rise (SLR), earthquake acceleration and a combination of the two scenarios. The results indicated that dynamic response values of the canal slope have different variation rules under near and far field earthquakes. Finally, the damage location and pattern of the slope failure are different in varying groundwater conditions.},

abstract = {Grain yield (GY) prediction for wheat based on canopy spectral reflectance can improve selection efficiency in breeding programs. Time-series spectral information from different growth stages such as flowering to maturity is considered to have high accuracy in predicting GY and combining this information from multiple growth stages could effectively improve prediction accuracy. For this, 207 wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown in full and limited irrigation treatments, and their canopy spectral reflectance was measured at the flowering, early, middle, and late grain fill stages. The potential of temporal spectral information at multiple growth stages for GY prediction was evaluated by a new method based on stacking the multiple growth stages data. Twenty VIs derived from spectral reflectance were used as the input feature of a support vector regression (SVR) to predict GY at each growth stage. The predicted GY values at multiple growth stages were trained by multiple linear regression (MLR) to establish a second-level prediction model. Results suggested that the prediction accuracy (R²) of VIs data from single growth stages ranged from 0.60 to 0.66 and 0.35 to 0.42 in the full and limited irrigation treatments, respectively. The prediction accuracy was increased by an average of 0.06, 0.07, and 0.07 after stacking the VIs of two, three, and four growth stages, respectively, under full irrigation. Similarly, under limited irrigation, the prediction accuracy was increased by 0.03, 0.04, and 0.04 by stacking the VIs of two, three, and four growth stages, respectively. Stacking of VIs of multiple important growth stages can increase the accuracy of GY prediction and application of a stable stacking model could increase the usefulness of data obtained from different phenotyping platforms.},

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic systems have become one of the most popular topics in the water management industry. Moreover, irrigation networks are water- and energy-hungry, and utility managers are likely to adapt water consumption (and consequently energy demand) to the hours in which there is energy availability. In countries such as Spain (with high irradiance values), solar energy is an available green alternative characterised by zero electricity costs and significantly lower environmental impact. In this work, several types of irrigation scheduled programmes (according to different irrigation sectors) that minimise the number of photovoltaic solar panels to be installed are studied; moreover, the effects of the variable costs linked to energy (energy and emissions costs) are presented. Finally, the effect of incorporating batteries for storing energy to protect the system against emergencies, such as unfavourable weather, is proposed. The irrigation hours available to satisfy water demands are limited by sunlight; they are also limited by the condition that the irrigation schedule type has to be rigid (predetermined rotation) and that the pressure at any node has to be above minimum pressure required by standards. A real case study is performed, and the results obtained demonstrate that there is no universal solution; this is because the portfolio of alternatives is based on investments for purchasing equipment at present and also on future energy savings (revenues). Apart from these two values, there is an economic value (equivalent discontinuous discount rate), which also influences the final results.},

Using a farm panel from a stratified random sample of farms from major agricultural districts of West Bengal, we find evidence that private investment in irrigation which reduced irrigation costs for farms played an important role in the growth process. However, the growth in private investment was itself stimulated by tenancy registration and minikit distribution programs implemented by local governments. This channel helps account for the substantial spillover effects of the tenancy reform on non-tenant farms noted in an earlier study.

@article{VanSteenbergen2011,
abstract = {This article discusses spate irrigation in Ethiopia and aims to take stock of the current status of spate irrigation development. It summarizes experiences so far and formulates a number of recommendations on the development of this upcoming resource management system. It argues that raised weirs are useful mainly in areas where a large head for spate flow diversion is required, but that traditional earthen structures with conical stone/gabion reinforcements are cost-effective and technically adequate for floodwater distribution and management. It contends that the practical successes of sediment settling ponds (gravel traps) are at best mixed. Even where a small basin is justified, it can only ever trap a small proportion of the incoming sediment load. It is better to allow large floods with excessive sediment load ({\textgreater}100,000 ppm) to by-pass upstream intakes to be diverted lower down the system, and provide additional livelihood opportunities in downstream areas in the form of rangeland and agro-forestry development. This is particularly useful in the lowlands of Ethiopia with large pastoral community where spate irrigation is yet to make in-roads. The article further explains that water rights in spate are different from the sharing and allocation of perennial flows--they are dynamic and respond to a situation that differs from year to year as well as within a year and that a certain degree of inequity among users is inevitable. Keeping the command area compact can ensure two or more irrigation turns and this can highly increase productivity as crops are no longer in the 'stress zone'. To transform spate irrigation in Ethiopia from subsistence to a business-oriented production system, the article proposes the promotion of cash crops including pulses and oil seeds as well as encouraging investors to go for bio-fuel development and agro-forestry in the lowland areas where huge potential exist. To avoid vehement conflicts that may arise among the settled agricultural and pastoral communities due to the implementation of the business-oriented production system, the traditional rights of the pastoral communities must be respected and their rangeland and water resources be safeguarded. For maximum yield, soil moisture conservation measures such as pre-irrigation land preparation, deep ploughing and mulching are essential as is the conjunctive use of spate flow and groundwater. Last, but most important, the article emphasizes that farmers need to be placed at the heart of any spate irrigation development programme as primary beneficiaries, managers and operators as well as part of the decision making institution.},

abstract = {This article discusses spate irrigation in Ethiopia and aims to take stock of the current status of spate irrigation development. It summarizes experiences so far and formulates a number of recommendations on the development of this upcoming resource management system. It argues that raised weirs are useful mainly in areas where a large head for spate flow diversion is required, but that traditional earthen structures with conical stone/gabion reinforcements are cost-effective and technically adequate for floodwater distribution and management. It contends that the practical successes of sediment settling ponds (gravel traps) are at best mixed. Even where a small basin is justified, it can only ever trap a small proportion of the incoming sediment load. It is better to allow large floods with excessive sediment load ({\textgreater}100,000 ppm) to by-pass upstream intakes to be diverted lower down the system, and provide additional livelihood opportunities in downstream areas in the form of rangeland and agro-forestry development. This is particularly useful in the lowlands of Ethiopia with large pastoral community where spate irrigation is yet to make in-roads. The article further explains that water rights in spate are different from the sharing and allocation of perennial flows--they are dynamic and respond to a situation that differs from year to year as well as within a year and that a certain degree of inequity among users is inevitable. Keeping the command area compact can ensure two or more irrigation turns and this can highly increase productivity as crops are no longer in the 'stress zone'. To transform spate irrigation in Ethiopia from subsistence to a business-oriented production system, the article proposes the promotion of cash crops including pulses and oil seeds as well as encouraging investors to go for bio-fuel development and agro-forestry in the lowland areas where huge potential exist. To avoid vehement conflicts that may arise among the settled agricultural and pastoral communities due to the implementation of the business-oriented production system, the traditional rights of the pastoral communities must be respected and their rangeland and water resources be safeguarded. For maximum yield, soil moisture conservation measures such as pre-irrigation land preparation, deep ploughing and mulching are essential as is the conjunctive use of spate flow and groundwater. Last, but most important, the article emphasizes that farmers need to be placed at the heart of any spate irrigation development programme as primary beneficiaries, managers and operators as well as part of the decision making institution.},

abstract = {Irrigation plays a significant role in achieving food and nutrition security in dry regions. However, detailed ex-ante appraisals of irrigation development investments are required to efficiently allocate resources and optimize returns on investment. Due to the inherent system complexity and uncertain consequences of irrigation development interventions coupled with limited data availability, deterministic cost-benefit analysis can be ineffective in guiding formal decision-making. Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE) helps to overcome the challenges of evaluating investments in such contexts. In this paper, we applied SIE to assess the viability of an irrigation dam construction project in northern Ethiopia. We used expert knowledge elicitation to generate a causal model of the planned intervention's impact pathway, including all identified benefits, costs and risks. Estimates of the input variables were collected from ten subject matter experts. We then applied the SIE tools: Monte Carlo simulation, Partial Least Squares regression, and Value of Information analysis to project prospective impacts of the project and identify critical knowledge gaps. Model results indicate that the proposed irrigation dam project is highly likely to increase the overall benefits and improve food and nutrition status of local farmers. However, the overall value of these benefits is unlikely to exceed the sum of the investment costs and negative externalities involved in the intervention. Simulation results suggest that the planned irrigation dam may improve income, as well as food and nutrition security, but would generate negative environmental effects and high investment costs. The Stochastic Impact Evaluation approach proved effective in this study and is likely to have potential for evaluating other agricultural development interventions that face system complexity, data scarcity and uncertainty.},

@article{Alizadeh2013,
abstract = {This paper explores the effects of streamflow uncertainty and the type of stochastic order, which is used for comparing stochastic variables, on optimal design of a reservoir multi-crop irrigation district system. Four nonlinear mathematical programs with an economic objective function including deterministic, stochastic-EXP with expected value order, stochastic-SD with stochastic dominance (SD) order, and stochastic-EGCL with expected gain-confidence limit (EGCL) order were developed. Afterwards, the approaches of successive linear programming (SLP) and PSO-MC, which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation (MC), to solve the programs were selected. Hajiarab Irrigation District located in Ghazvin Province of Iran was used as a case study and the results obtained from using different programs and solution approaches were analyzed and compared. Among the solution approaches, SLP could not solve the programs other than the deterministic one while PSO-MC could find at least good solutions, if not the global optima, for all the programs. Among the main decision variables, the stochastic programs resulted in a reduced size of irrigation district compared with that obtained by the deterministic program. Moreover, the programs using stochastic orders other than a simple expected value converged at solutions different from the solution reached by the expected value-based program.},

@phdthesis{Smith2011,
abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to demonstrate through a simulation and optimization model that successful farming operations can be continued while agricultural producers benefit financially from a proportional parting-off of the water right. Further, this dissertation will describe what an implementation embodiment of the technology described looks like operationally and as a practical matter.   This dissertation presents factors associated with the use of, and change in, water rights that may be considered by farmers interested in evaluating a package of changed farming practices intended to optimize future revenues. A future low-risk revenue stream may be brought into the farm's revenue forecast by virtue of the lease of a proportional amount of water to a municipal, industrial, or environmental user. Optimization algorithms are used to evaluate a farmer-considered package of changed practices which may include: deficit irrigation, new crops, dryland crops, permanent or rotational fallowing of fields, and crop rotations. Some farmers will also consider upgraded irrigation systems as an aspect of implementing these practices. The farmer-driven optimization may include any or all of these changed practices as well as continued full irrigation of crops. To evaluate and compare multiple practices as a cohesive package and in the context of the option to lease water is new. The simulation and optimization model output assists in comparing historic practices and net returns with future practices and net returns which would include a revenue stream associated with a lease or sale of a proportion of the farmer's CU water. The actual comparison between alternatives is accomplished by evaluating the change in net returns between historic practices and modeled future practices. The model utilizes crop water production functions, some of which are very newly researched and reported, to forecast crop yields based on deficit irrigation practices. The model can utilize up to 20 fields and 18 combinations of irrigation practices and crops. Up to seven deficit irrigation crops per field can be evaluated within a simulation and optimization scenario.   Recommendations are made for future research and software development that will incorporate the optimization routines into a larger collection of data inputs and a database intended to help farmers, ditch companies, or cooperative farmer groups manage their consumptive use water under a change decree and aggregated changed practices.   It is recommended that the ultimate and fully implemented system include: (1) A package of technologies under one umbrella software program. (2) A decision support system (DSS). (3) A farm operations simulation. (4) An optimization program for year-to-year evaluation of alternative farm operational strategies and potential for changed practices. (5) A tool for evaluating a proportional parting off of consumptive use water. (6) A means of developing and monitoring an annual water use budget. (7) A database for cataloging historical and current operations of substitute water supply plans or change case decrees. (8) A monitoring and reporting system for documenting the implementation strategy. (9) A planning tool used year after year to plan pending annual operations against a farm or farmer cooperative total entity water budget.   Primary issues and pitfalls to implementing the process and strategies described are framed by these questions: (1) Can municipal interests view a long term lease as a viable part of their water portfolio and their projected safe yield at a future date? (2) Can farmers accept the perceived dramatic changes to their farming operations? (3) Can the science underpin the strategy sufficiently to satisfy change case objectors and the Colorado Water Court? (4) Can water be physically transferred based on existing water diversion and delivery infrastructure or is new infrastructure required in some cases? (5) Will farmers be interested in and accepting of a long term lease and might they also consider a buyout of the lease at a discounted net present worth? (6) Do existing State of Colorado statutes support the type of water transfer that is described?  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

abstract = {In Egypt, a shortage in irrigation water is a serious issue, because increases in water demands and water conflicts have become social problems. The Egyptian government attempts to solve these problems by strengthening Water Users' Organizations (WUOs), especially the Branch Canal Water Users' Association (BCWUA), where the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) policy was introduced. Targeting this policy, we tried strengthening the BCWUA by providing a four-step training program: problem analysis, capacity development, action plan creation and action plan incorporation for problem solutions. As a series of activities, strengthening of BCWUA was succeeded with elimination of excess water intake and reduces the number of water conflicts. For introducing PIM, transparency in operation, discloser of information and failures in canal facilities have become the main obstacles. Joint repair work by the government and WUOs can effectively overcome the failures.},

@article{Akbar2013,
abstract = {Much of inland Australia has been in perpetual drought since 1997 except during 2010 when above average rainfall occurred. It has been the worst drought since 1788 when European settlement began. Water scarcity poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture in major irrigation systems across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). There is a need for water-saving measures and a structured approach to assess water loss in earthen supply channels. This paper presents such an approach to assess and reduce seepage losses for improving irrigation efficiencies. Main elements of this approach are the following: field measurements, hydrologic modelling, potential options for seepage reduction, economic analysis and financing water-saving investments. Using data from two irrigation systems in the southern MDB, a case is made for reducing seepage water losses in irrigation supply channels in a cost-effective manner using low-cost technologies. Increasing the level of security for investments in water-saving programs provides incentives to key stakeholders to achieve water-saving targets. Considering the value of water recovered from reducing seepage loss at irrigation system level, this study demonstrates how reducing just one component (seepage) from the total water losses in irrigation systems can help improve water supplies as well as the environmental flows. Potential options for financing infrastructure improvement for saving irrigation water are proposed and discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Two field experiments were carried out at Giza Agricultural Research Station during successive seasons 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effect of four irrigation intervals (irrigation every seven days, irrigation every seven days until silking then irrigation every two weeks, irrigation every two weeks until silking and irrigation every seven days and irrigation every two weeks during the whole season) and two maize hybrids (TWC 310 and TWC 324) on maize yield, its components and some water relations. to determine the most important yield components using different statistical procedures Results showed that irrigation intervals, differed significantly with respect to ear diameter, number of grains per row, number of grains per ear and biological yield (ton/fed) in the first season. Whereas, in the second season irrigation intervals were found to be significant for ear length, ear diameter, number of barren per plants, plant yield, grain yield (Ardab/fed) and biological yield (ton/fed). Results also indicated that both hybrids were not significantly different, except for number of grains per ear in the first season and biological yield in the second season. The interaction between hybrides and irrigation treatments revealed that, to obtain the highest maize yield, yield components and water use efficiency, it could be recommended to plant TWC 310 and irrigate it every seven days. Furthermore, simple correlation analysis revealed that seven yield components were found to be highly significant and correlated with plant yield. Whereas, multiple linear regression analysis exposed five yield components that had the highest contribution to maize plant yield with R super(2) equals to 0.938. However, principle component analysis was more efficient than simple correlation analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, which assigned only four yield components that could accounted for 95.045 {\%} of the total variation. These four yield components were ear length, number of grain per row, number of grain per ear, and 100-grain weight Therefore, it is recommended to select for these four components in breeding programs for maize hybrids.},

abstract = {Soil salinization seriously restricts the development of agricultural economies in arid and semi-arid areas. Mastering the spatial variability characteristics of multi-scale soil salt in irrigated areas is of great significance for the improvement and utilization of saline soil and agricultural production. The middle and lower reaches of the Yingdaya River were selected as the study area, and the irrigation area was divided into three scales: the L scale (irrigation area), the M scale (township level) and the S scale (village level). A total of 131 data sets were obtained through field investigations and sampling, and the spatial variability characteristics and scale effects of the soil salt in multi-scale irrigated areas were analyzed using classical statistics, geostatistics and nested model methods. The results showed that the average soil salinities at the L, M and S scales were 1.664{\%}, 0.263{\%} and 0.217{\%}, respectively, and the coefficients of variation were 2.564, 1.312 and 0.866, respectively. The soil salinities at different scales exhibited moderate spatial correlation and anisotropic characteristics, through which, the maximum variation directions for L and M were 113° and 139°, respectively, and the maximum variation direction of the S scale was 86°. The spatial distribution of the soil salinity is affected by the scale effect, but the accuracy of spatial estimations can be effectively improved by using a multi-scale nested model for interpolation. The high-value areas of soil salt in the irrigation areas were distributed in the southeastern regions of the study area, and weakened in small areas around the high-value areas. The influence of each influencing factor on the soil salinization at different scales also differed. Except for the slope, the correlations between other influencing factors and the soil salt content gradually decreased with decreases in the scale. This study provides a concise summary of the spatial variation analysis of soil characteristic variables, and also provides a scientific basis for the formulation and implementation of salinization control programs.},

abstract = {Maize being sub-tropical crop is sensitive to water deficit during the early growth stages; particularly clay-rich soil, due to the compaction of the soil. It is well-documented that potential sub-surface drip irrigation (SDI) (Full irrigation; SDIFull (100{\%} field capacity (FC)), Deficit irrigation; SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC)) improves water use efficiency, which leads to increased crop productivity; since it has a constraint that SDI excludes soil air around the root-zone during irrigation events, which alter the root function and crop performance. Additionally, in clayrich soils, the root system of plants generally suffers the limitation of oxygen, particularly the temporal hypoxia, and occasionally from root anoxia; while SDI system accomplishes with the aerating stream of irrigation in the rhizosphere could provide oxygen root environment. The oxygen can be introduced into the irrigation stream of SDI through two ways: the venturi principle, or by using solutions of hydrogen peroxide through the air injection system. Therefore, the application of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; HP) can mitigate the adverse effect of soil compactness and also lead to improving the growth, yield and yield attributes of maize in clay-rich soil. Considering the burning issue, a field study was conducted in consecutive two seasons of 2017 and 2018; where hybrid maize was cultivated as a second crop, to evaluate the effect of liquid-injection of H2O2(HP) into the irrigation stream of SDI on the performance of maize in a clay-rich soil field of Adana, Turkey. When soil water content decreased in 50{\%} of available water, irrigation was performed. The amount of water applied to reach the soil water content to the field capacity is SDIFull (100{\%} FC) and 70{\%} FC of this water is SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC). In the irrigation program, hydrogen peroxide (HP) was applied at intervals of 7 days on average according to available water with and without HP: SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 0 ppm HP with full SDI irrigation; SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP with deficit SDI irrigation; SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC) + 0 ppm HP, SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP and SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC) + 500 ppm HP. Deficit irrigation (SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC)) program was started from tasseling stage and continued up to the physiological maturity stage with sub-soil drip irrigation. H2O2 was applied 3 times during the growing season. Two years' results revealed that the liquid-injection of H2O2 into the irrigation stream of SDI improved the growth and yield-related attributes and grain yield of maize. Based on the obtained results, during the extreme climatic condition in the year 2017, SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP was more effective than SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 0 ppm HP on all traits for relative to full irrigation. While, during the favourable climatic condition in the 2018 season, SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP was more effective than full irrigation with SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 0 ppm HP for the grain yield, grains, and SPAD value. Accordingly, the most effective treatment was SDIFull (100{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP, as it gave the highest growth and yield-related attributes and grain yield of maize followed by SDIDeficit (70{\%} FC) + 250 ppm HP. Therefore, SDIFull with 250 ppm H2O2using as liquid-injection may be recommended to mitigate the adverse effect of soil compactness particularly water-deficit stress in clay-rich soil for the sustainability of maize production.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVETo assess the impact of schistosomiasis control activities in Hippo Valley Sugar Estates.DESIGNA situation analysis of schistosomiasis control activities in Hippo Valley Estates was made. Snail and parasitology data collected over 13 and 21 years respectively was analysed to determine the impact of control activities.SETTINGOnly data collected in Hippo Valley Sugar Estates was analysed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESReduction in prevalence of schistosomiasis and snail population densities.RESULTSPrevalence of Schistosoma haematobium reduced from over 50{\%} in 1980 to below 10{\%} in 2000. Similarly, prevalence of S. mansoni reduced from 25{\%} in 1980 to below 10{\%} in 2000. Over the years, prevalences for both S. haematobium and S. mansoni fluctuated but showed a general decline. Snail numbers in water bodies within the estates fluctuated over the years, dropping from over 100,000 snails in 1986 to about 10,000 snails in 1998. The amount of niclosamid used to control snails varied over the years with less than 10 kg per year being used between 1995 and 1998. A marked improvement in safe water and sanitation facilities was noted.CONCLUSIONThe significant reduction in prevalence and snail numbers suggests that the Hippo Valley Estates control programme has been successful. The success is attributed to chemotherapy and snail control supported by general improvement in safe water and sanitation facilities and health education.},

abstract = {IntroductionSurgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common complications after gastrointestinal surgery, with a reported incidence of approximately 10{\%}–25{\%}, which is higher than the rates after other types of surgery. Intraoperative wound irrigation (IOWI) is a simple intervention for SSI prevention, and recent studies have reported that IOWI with aqueous povidone–iodine (PVP-I) is significantly more effective at reducing the incidence of SSI than saline. However, the evidence level of previous trials evaluating the efficacy of aqueous PVP-I solution for preventing SSI has been low.Methods and analysesWe propose a single-institute, prospective, randomised, blinded-endpoint trial to assess the superiority of IOWI with aqueous 10{\%} PVP-I solution compared with normal saline for reducing SSI in clean-contaminated wounds after elective gastrointestinal surgery. In the study group, IOWI with 40 mL of aqueous 10{\%} PVP-I solution is performed for 1 min before skin suture, and in the control group, IOWI with 100 mL of saline is performed for 1 min before skin suture. We hypothesise that IOWI with aqueous 10{\%} PVP-I solution will achieve a 50{\%} reduction in the incidence of SSIs. The target number of cases is set at 950. The primary outcome is the incidence of incisional SSI up to postoperative day 30 and will be analysed in the modified intention-to-treat set.Ethics and disseminationThis trial was designed and is being conducted by Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, with approval from the Bioethics Committee for Clinical Research, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University. Participant recruitment began in June 2019. The final results will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals immediately after trial completion.Trial registration numberUMIN000036889.},

abstract = {To sustainably use water resources, it is important to quantify water availability in a certain region. Due to climate change, population increase, and economic development, water demand increases continuously. Consequently, the difference between supply and demand of water becomes a significant issue, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In this research, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been applied to the Guadalupe river basin, to assess supply and demand analysis of water resources in this area, specifically for the irrigation of agricultural crops and municipal uses. From the land use, soil type, and terrain slope maps, 763 Hydrostatic Release Units (HRU) were estimated, distributed in the diverse relief types making up the basin, featured by mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, and valleys. For the crop area, 159 HRU were found with the three slope classification types, where 57 HRU represent 91{\%} of the cultivated area on slopes, from 0 to 15{\%}, located in the Ojos Negros and Guadalupe Valleys. The Soil Conservation Service method (SCS) was used to estimate the average monthly runoff and soil moisture content. As a result, water resource parameters related to the supply were determined with this, e.g., runoff, aquifer recharge, flow, infiltration, and others. Crop coefficient values (Kc) were used to determine crop evapotranspiration (ETc), to estimate the water demand of these for each month, using the multi-year monthly average reference evapotranspiration (ETₒ) calculated with the SWAT model. Overall good performance was obtained considering average monthly discharges data from the Agua Caliente gauging station. The model was calibrated, modifying the parameters chosen according to sensitivity analysis: SCS curve number, base-flow factor, ground-flow delay, and the threshold for return-flow occurrence. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool–Calibration and Uncertainty Programs SWAT-CUP has different goodness-of-fit indicators for the model e.g., determination coefficient (R²), standard deviation of the measured data (RSR), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), and others. Multiple iterations were performed, resulting in a ratio between the root mean square error and the standard deviation of the measured data (RSR) of 0.61, a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.70, and a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.63. A supply–demand analysis of the volume generated by the runoff from the basin was performed using the method of estimating useful volume for a reservoir. It is observed in these results that only positive deviations were obtained, implying that runoff in this basin is not enough to meet monthly demand. Finally, the need to establish actions to ensure water management efficiency is highlighted, both for irrigation of agricultural crops and for supply to the region population.},

abstract = {Smallholder irrigation technologies introduced in sub-Saharan Africa are often unsustainable in the sense that they are not maintained by their users. In contrast, there is clear evidence that smallholder farmers have been developing and expanding irrigated areas. An approach was developed that takes these farmers' initiatives as a starting point to stimulate further irrigated agricultural expansion in central Mozambique, dubbed the PIAD approach (Participatory Irrigated Agricultural Development). The approach was documented through field diaries, participatory monitoring and evaluation. This article presents an analysis and reflection on the design process. Amongst other things, it shows that a crucial difference is the division of roles between users, contractors and irrigation engineers, both in terms of division of responsibilities and in understanding the interdisciplinary connections of irrigated agricultural production. The approach allowed users to be kept in the driver's seat of development while going beyond improving irrigation infrastructure, including agronomic and institutional interventions. Additionally, the results show that technologies are being sustained by their users and copied by farmers in neighboring areas. We conclude that the approach allows for active investment by the users, both in design as well as in project costs and labor, which later results in the improvements being maintained and copied, a clear marker of sustainability.},

abstract = {Farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) in the high altitude valleys of the Karakorum, Pakistan, continue to be managed effectively despite increased pressure on the social arrangements that sustain them. Colonial era records shows that over a century ago government agencies undertook irrigation support projects. In the past three decades, government agencies and the non-government agency Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP), which channels foreign funds into the region, have actively engaged in the provision of irrigation support. This article seeks to explore whether such projects support or undermine farmer-managed irrigation systems and the complex institutional arrangements that underpin them. Field research using ethnographic and participatory methods was conducted in spring 2013 in the upper Shigar valley, Skardu district, Gilgit-Baltistan. The findings show that irrigation development is a political activity that involves village-based actors, religious leaders, local politicians, and government and non-government agencies. Government agencies operate in a largely top-down, engineering mode, their larger projects limited to villages suffering water scarcity. The local government provides small funds for renovation work of FMIS, though allocation of funds is highly politicized. Non-government agencies, for a variety of reasons including donor-funding cycles, apply a one-size-fits-all ‘participatory' model in an attempt to socially engineer rules and institutions. In communities divided by factionalism the use of such external models that stress formation of committees are unlikely to yield positive results, and could instead contribute to undermining the very systems they seek to support. This research argues that irrigation interventions should take care to build upon the rich and complex social arrangements that have sustained FMIS through the centuries.},

abstract = {The survivorship and distribution of Anopheles arabiensis larvae and pupae was examined in a rice agro-ecosystem in Mwea Irrigation Scheme, central Kenya, from August 2005 to April 2006, prior to implementation of larval control programme. Methods Horizontal life tables were constructed for immatures in semi-field condition. The time spent in the various immature stages was determined and survival established. Vertical life tables were obtained from five paddies sampled by standard dipping technique. Results Pre-adult developmental time for An. arabiensis in the trays in the experimental set up in the screen house was 11.85 days from eclosion to emergence. The mean duration of each instar stage was estimated to be 1.40 days for first instars, 2.90 days for second instars, 1.85 days for third instars, 3.80 days for fourth instars and 1.90 days for pupae. A total of 590 individuals emerged into adults, giving an overall survivorship from L1 to adult emergence of 69.4{\%}. A total of 4,956 An. arabiensis immatures were collected in 1,400 dips throughout the sampling period. Of these, 55.9{\%} were collected during the tillering stage, 42.5{\%} during the transplanting period and 1.6{\%} during the land preparation stage. There was a significant difference in the An. arabiensis larval densities among the five stages. Also there was significant variation in immature stage composition for each day's collection in each paddy. These results indicate that the survival of the immatures was higher in some paddies than others. The mortality rate during the transplanting was 99.9{\%} and at tillering was 96.6{\%}, while the overall mortality was 98.3{\%}. Conclusion The survival of An. arabiensis immatures was better during the tillering stage of rice growth. Further the survival of immatures in rice fields is influenced by the rice agronomic activities including addition of nitrogenous fertilizers and pesticides. For effective integrated vector management, the application of larvicides should target An. arabiensis larvae at the tillering stage (early vegetative stage of rice) when their survival in the aquatic habitats is high to significantly reduce them and the larvicides should be long-lasting to have a significant impact on the malaria vector productivity on the habitats.},

abstract = {The level of irrigation restriction to apply in a deficit irrigation (DI) programme for sustainable peach ('Baby gold 6') production was investigated. The experiment involved four irrigation treatments over five consecutive seasons (2007-2011). They were full irrigation (control), reducing irrigation by 20 {\%} during the first half of stage III (DI-80 {\%}), withholding irrigation until reaching a light stress level (DI-L) and withholding irrigation until reaching a moderate stress level (DI-M). The withholding of irrigation in both DI-L and DI-M was applied only during stage II and postharvest periods and was based on midday stem water potential thresholds ([Psi] {\^{}}sub stem{\^{}}). For the DI-L treatment -1.5 MPa was used in both periods, and for DI-M -1.8 and -2.0 MPa were used during stage II and postharvest, respectively. Average [Psi] {\^{}}sub stem{\^{}} values during DI periods were approximately -1.4 and -1.2 MPa for DI-M and DI-L, respectively. The pre-defined thresholds required to trigger irrigation were rarely reached. No significant differences between treatments were found in terms of yield in any experimental year. However, DI-M and to a lesser extent DI-L had lower final fruit fresh mass at harvest related to lower [Psi] {\^{}}sub stem{\^{}} after three consecutive years of the experiment (during 2010 and 2011). Therefore, in terms of fruit size, DI was not sustainable. Rather than lowering [Psi] {\^{}}sub stem{\^{}} thresholds, we recommend discontinuing DI after 3-year application.},

abstract = {The present paper proposes a model of Multi Objective Fuzzy Linear Programming (MOFLP) based on Fuzzy Parametric Programming (FPP) to solve the problem of optimal cropping pattern in an irrigation system. It has been found that in order to solve the problem of uncertainty in the planning of sustainable irrigation, the concept of fuzzy logic has been in practice for long and was being systematically applied either to the case of fuzzy objectives alone or to case of fuzzy objectives with fuzzy resources. There has not been reported a single case of either formulation and application of MOFLP model for the planning of irrigation making use of fuzzy objective function coefficients, fuzzy technological coefficients and fuzzy resources. The approach presented in the MOFLP model attempts to consider the fuzziness of all the coefficients of a mathematical model, as they present themselves in the real life situations. The present model takes into account the experience, information and expectations of the Decision Maker (DM). The objective of the model is to maximize simultaneously four objective functions viz. the Net Benefits (NB), Crop Production (CP), Employment Generation (EG) and Manure Utilization (MU). The model proposed takes into consideration the fuzziness involved in the coefficient of objective functions, technological coefficients and stipulations. The model intends to develop a program of sustainable irrigation planning for the Jayakwadi Project, Stage-I, located in the State of Maharashtra, India. The optimal cropping pattern has been obtained for five different strategies. The results finally obtained through the fifth strategy appear realistic, promising and effective as they involve the consideration of the uncertainty contained in coefficient of objective functions, technological coefficients and stipulations simultaneously. The model may be applied to any irrigation project with a view to utilize the resources available optimally and deal with the problem of uncertainty in realistic ways in solving real life problems.},

abstract = {Water cycle, land management, and environmental sustainability are intimately linked. Sustainable land and water management practices are vital for sustaining agricultural productivity and regional development. Unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity constraint over long periods can impose significant costs in terms of lost opportunities in farm production and regional development, say by causing waterlogging and salinity. On-farm and regional salt and water balance dynamics are modeled as a sustainability or carrying capacity constraint, proxied by regional salt and water balance; on-farm land and water management practices are then adjusted to meet the constraint, such that individual actions do not lead to a net change in the ground water and salt balance. Common actions across the farms would achieve the overall environmental sustainability. An irrigated area in southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia serves as a case study example. Integrated hydrologic, economic, agricultural, and environmental models called SWAGMAN series are used to evaluate the impacts of a range of on-farm interventions on farm income and environmental sustainability. The results show that policies such as restrictions on area under certain crops, and tradable groundwater recharge/salinity credits both offer higher total gross margin and net present value than the business as usual scenario, specifically in the long run - win-win options for the farmers and the environment. The modeling results thus confirm the widely held view that unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity can impose significant costs on regional communities. In-depth hydrological and economic analyses are needed to shape and guide society's vision for sustainable land and water management.},

abstract = {Silage corn is an important source of feed in animal husbandry, often affected by the feeding action of diverse corn borers that can compromise harvest quality and quantity. According to the need to reduce the use of chemical insecticides, the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different IPM programs comparing microbial (Btk and baculovirus) and chemical control methods, alone or combined, against O. nubilalis and H. armigera. Assessments were based on counting the number of larvae, inspecting plants superficially and inside the stem, and estimating the derived damages. All tested products proved to be effective in containing the density of these lepidopteran species, with microbial control agents having comparable efficacy in respect to the reference chemical substances (lambda-cialotrina and chlorantraniliprole), even if periodic treatment repetition was required to ensure over-time protection until harvest. Both Btk and HaNPV were successfully applied by the irrigation system during flowering and fruit development periods, when plant height did not allow the use of a tractor-mounted spray bar. This biocontainment approach appears to be sustainable and technically compatible with farm needs.},

abstract = {Indian economy is still an agrarian economy more than 50{\%} of people in India are still dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Rainfed areas without any source of irrigation in the country still accounts for 60{\%} of the cultivated area and these areas are home to majority of rural poor and marginal farmers. Food security of small and marginal farmers in these regions are greatly jeopardized by the lack of assured irrigation. In this backdrop, there is an urgent need to explore the possibilities of sustainable and innovative forms of irrigation. One such innovative experiment is happa experiment which is viewed as Integrated Natural Resource Management( INRM) emphasizing both water and soil management. A happa is a mud-excavated small water harvesting structure with the average size of 50ft× 45ft×12 ft. The programme is going on in some dry zones where the happa is being excavated in the private land of the farmer wherefrom the farmer can irrigate his own agricultural land with average command area of happa being 0.6 - 0.75 acres. The construction cost one happa is being funded from NREGS scheme, the flagship programme of Government of India for employment generation. After the construction of happa, it is managed by the farmer himself and all the operational expenditure is being incurred by the farmer for mainataining these. This model has got success in some dry zones. We have selected a village for our primary survey of households in the Bankura district which is located dry zone of West Bengal. There is specific geographical concentration of backwardness and poverty in these areas and these regions are affected by continuous degradation of natural resources. The main objectives of the study are as follows: (1) To judge the economic viability of the project using standard cost benefit analysis tools like NPV, BCR and IRR. (ii) Assessment of ecological and social impacts of the project, (iii) Identifying of different kinds of benefits accrued from the project, (iv) scope of upscaling of the project with the identification of problem areas in upscaling Our analysis reveals that the small irrigation program like happa has made a strong impact on the livelihood of rural people. The environmental impacts include soil and moisture conservation of the watershed area. The economic benefits include incremental production from paddy production and vegetable production through irrigation. The success and upscaling of the programme depends very much on the system of planning, application, execution, monitoring and fund-flow.},

abstract = {This article is an introduction to an ASABE Special Collection concerning Center Pivot Technology Transfer in this issue of Transactions of the ASABE consisting of 9 articles. The year 2018 marked the 40th anniversary of research and development with Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA) for use with center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems. Since 1978, researchers, extension specialists, and industry have continued development of multiple types of technologies that are suitable for mobile lateral irrigation platforms. A two-year technology transfer effort with funding from the USDA-ARS Ogallala Aquifer Program (OAP) was initiated in January 2017 to promote adoption of advanced and efficient irrigation technologies and to highlight recommended practices for these mobile irrigation platforms [center pivot (CP) and lateral linear move (LM) systems]. The articles in this Special Collection address four major topic areas: In-canopy and near-canopy irrigation application from moving platforms, the history and status of irrigation in the US Great Plains region with its large concentration of CP and LMS systems, site-specific variable rate irrigation (VRI) technologies for moving platforms, and uniformity evaluations for CP systems. While these 9 articles are not inclusive of all the important advances in irrigation for moving platforms since 1978, they illustrate that continued progress occurs by combining engineering and agronomic sciences to make improvements in irrigation management. Pressurized irrigation from moving platforms is increasing in the USA and will be an important tool in meeting global food and water challenges. In addition to introducing and providing a brief summary of the Special Collection. This article provides additional rationale for the CP Technology Transfer Effort.},

abstract = {Landscape irrigation classes taught at the university or junior college level train people who fill the need for qualified installation, maintenance, and design personnel in the landscape industry. While acknowledging that learning objectives and teaching outcomes vary by academic program and institution, the goal of this article is to present a didactic approach for teaching landscape irrigation design to non-engineering students, based on informed practice and personal observation. The authors, who have taught landscape irrigation design to a wide range of college students, present a collective five-step approach to the topic. Each of the five steps is ordered to maintain student attention and interaction with the subject. Each step can be treated as an independent unit of study for new course development, or as a framework for improvement of an existing course. A sample syllabus is provided to show how the five-step methodology can be incorporated into the explicit learning objectives of a typical `college course. Results from three years of student evaluations are presented as a case study showing that the five-step approach can be applied with positive results in terms of student attitude and perceived teacher performance. This article encourages further input and discussion from readers and educators, given the increasing importance of knowledgeable irrigation design, operation, and maintenance personnel in a water-hungry world.},

abstract = {Small-scale irrigation is playing an important role in adapting to climate change, achieving food security, and improving household incomes. The Ethiopian Government considers irrigated agriculture as a primary engine of economic growth and plans to increase the current level of irrigation infrastructure three-fold by the end of 2015. However, there has been concern regarding the performance and management of existing small-scale irrigation. Based on the assessment of 52 small-scale irrigation schemes, and three case study sites, we describe the challenges and interventions required to improve irrigation water management in Ethiopia. Though most schemes are operational, many do not operate at full capacity, due to design failures, excessive siltation, poor agronomic and water management practices, and weak local institutions. In addition to low returns, there is competition for irrigation water between upstream and downstream users, vegetable growers and cereal growers, and between farmers with large irrigable plots and those with small plots. Despite these challenges, our field assessment revealed that small scale irrigation increases crop yields, improves crop diversification, and reduces the risk of crop failure. We emphasize in this paper the need for incentives to improve productivity and minimize conflicts, while enhancing innovation capacity, developing scheme-specific intensification strategies, and promoting collective action. We also describe how benefits from water investments could be substantially increased by overcoming design constraints, strengthening water user associations, and protecting catchments.},

@article{Clemmens2008,
abstract = {Forty percent of freshwater withdrawals in the United States are for irrigated agriculture, which contribute more than {\$}50 billion to the economy. Increasing diversions of water for urban, environmental, and other uses will likely decrease water available to agriculture. Water conservation in agriculture is touted as a good method for minimizing the impact of reduced agricultural diversions on production. Because "wasted" water is often reused until it reaches the ocean, there are limitations to the true water savings that result from programs that aim to increase irrigation efficiency. True water savings can come from four areas: reduction of unnecessary evaporation and transpiration, more effective use of rainfall, reduction of deep percolation water that becomes severely degraded in quality, and reduction of runoff from fields that is not reusable downstream. Any other reduction in net water consumption must come from reductions in evapotranspiration from the crops grown, which requires either reduction in acreage or reduction in crop yield brought on by intentional plant water stress. Other benefits of field or district-level water conservation may include increased in-stream flows (due to lower diversions) and energy conservation due to less pumping or more hydroelectric production, but not result in true water savings, since unconsumed water returns as a usable water resource. Understanding the hydrologic settings is critical to determining true water savings from conservation practices. On-farm water conservation practices that provide true water savings at one location may be ineffective at another. In large irrigation projects, water delivery limitations often present obstacles to on-farm water conservation efforts.},

abstract = {The irrigation reuse of municipal and industrial effluents conserves freshwater resources and avoids direct nutrient discharges to surface waters. The sustainability of agricultural reuse programs, however, may be challenged by changes in phosphorus (P) availability. To understand the characteristics of P fractions, 130 soil samples were collected around an irrigation drain in May 2009, at the beginning of the growing season. In the study area, total phosphorus (TP) varied from 302.32 to 716.30 mg/kg, residual P varied from 18.21 to 126.08 mg/kg, and Olsen P varied from 0.71 to 90.04 mg/kg. The relative abundance detected for nearly every P fraction followed the order Ca-P{\textgreater}residual P{\textgreater}NaOH-PoNaOH-Pi{\textgreater}KCl-P. Although NaOH-Pi and most of the Ca-P fractions contributed markedly to P availability, NaOH-Po and Ca-P contributed more to residual P when different phosphate sources were added to the soil. However, the available P in the studied soils represented only 5.5{\%} of the TP, which was inadequate for the growth and development of crops. The influence of wastewater irrigation differs significantly at different depths. Wastewater irrigation is favorable to the transformation of stable P (NaOH-Po and Ca-P) into available P (NaOH-Pi), and can cause an increase in residual P in the shallow layer (0-60 cm), as well as an increase in TP in the middle layer (60-110 cm). However, wastewater and groundwater irrigation is beneficial to the increase in soil P concentration in the deep layer (110-170 cm). These effects may depend on soil properties, water cycles and biological processes, among other factors.},

abstract = {HighlightsAn integrated research and Extension program promoted adoption of computerized hole selection (CHS), surge irrigation, soil moisture monitoring, and multiple inlet rice irrigation (MIRI) for surface irrigators in Arkansas.Using a contest design, water use efficiency (WUE) was determined for maize, soybean, and rice fields, and report cards were provided to contest participants to provide feedback on their irrigation acumen.The highest yielding fields did not always result in the highest WUE.The contest was implemented on working commercial farms in the Arkansas Delta using flowmeters and in-field crop yield checks for the purpose of promoting adoption of irrigation water management (IWM).Abstract. The Arkansas “most crop per drop” irrigation contest is an integrated research and Extension program developed to assess water use, rainfall, and yield for the purpose of estimating water use efficiency (WUE). The irrigation contest resembles traditional yield contests, with the goal of documenting WUE and increasing adoption and awareness of irrigation water management (IWM) practices in the region. Adoption of IWM practices was greater for those who participated in the contest than their Arkansas peer average, with documented adoption increases of 33{\%} for computerized hole selection, 28{\%} for surge irrigation, and 51{\%} for soil moisture monitoring.

abstract = {The volume of wastewater generated by domestic, industrial and commercial sources has increased with population, urbanization, improved living conditions, and economic development. The productive use of wastewater has also increased, as millions of small-scale farmers in urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries depend on wastewater or wastewater polluted water sources to irrigate high-value edible crops for urban markets, often as they have no alternative sources of irrigation water. Undesirable constituents in wastewater can harm human health and the environment. Hence, wastewater irrigation is an issue of concern to public agencies responsible for maintaining public health and environmental quality. For diverse reasons, many developing countries are still unable to implement comprehensive wastewater treatment programs. Therefore in the near term, risk management and interim solutions are needed to prevent adverse impacts from wastewater irrigation. A combination of source control, and farm-level and post-harvest measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers. The WHO guidelines revised in 2006 for wastewater use suggest measures beyond the traditional recommendations of producing only industrial or non-edible crops, as in many situations it is impossible to enforce a change in the current cash crop pattern, or provide alternative vegetable supply to urban markets. There are several opportunities for improving wastewater management via improved policies, institutional dialogues and financial mechanisms, which would reduce the risks in agriculture. Effluent standards combined with incentives or enforcement can motivate improvements in water management by household and industrial sectors discharging wastewater from point sources. Segregation of chemical pollutants from urban wastewater facilitates treatment and reduces risk. Strengthening institutional capacity and establishing links between water delivery and sanitation sectors through inter-institutional coordination leads to more efficient management of wastewater and risk reduction.},

abstract = {The most important irrigation water source in Kansas is the High Plains aquifer, which recharges very slowly and has been steadily declining over the past three decades. A common policy prescription for conserving groundwater is to encourage the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies, which have higher water application efficiencies. In Kansas, such a policy approach has already been implemented through cost-share programs.    Although conserving water is the stated justification for such a cost-share program, its effectiveness is questioned. There is substantial controversy and conflicting evidence in the empirical literature on the conservation effects of technology. The conflicting results have likely come about because the processes driving the observed changes are highly complex and dynamic in nature. The purpose of this study is to examine the interactive and dynamic relationship among groundwater levels, crop selections and irrigation technology investments, which has so far been addressed separately or statically. The main objective is to examine whether the cost-share program is effective at conserving groundwater. To achieve this goal, I have analyzed the factors that determine the choice of irrigation technologies and water use and compared the cost effectiveness of the cost-share program with other policy tools.    The model developed has a nested framework, in which three optimization problems are involved. First, the optimal quantities of irrigation water are selected for all combinations of crop choices and irrigation technologies; second, the crop choice is determined under a certain irrigation technology; finally, the choice of irrigation technology is made by comparing the sum of current and discounted future profits.    Starting from a certain groundwater level, the model predicts the representative irrigator's choices of water use, crop and irrigation technology over time as the water table declines. The results suggest that the more efficient technology is adopted mainly because of limited water quantity rather than increased pumping costs. The cost-share program is effective at increasing the adoption rate of more efficient technologies. However, it is only effective at conserving water for irrigators with relatively high well capacities. In addition, the cost-share program would be more effective if it is implemented together with commodity programs providing incentives to plant less water-intensive crops.},

abstract = {Irrigation system is a scare resource in most of drought-stricken Africa. How to manage and maintain the existing irrigation facilities in Africa is a debatable issue to both policy makers and beneficiaries. Irrigation facilities run by farmer cooperatives are considered ineffective, unsuccessful and dysfunctional in Tanzania by many researchers. A cooperative irrigation scheme is a mechanism that features the collective management of rural irrigation facilities by farmers' cooperative with some government intervention and external support. There is an increasing emphasis on the roles of cooperative irrigation scheme in the development of the agriculture sector and poverty reduction of smallholder farmers. In this study, the authors investigated the management and services of this scheme and analyzed its contribution to poverty reduction of smallholder rice farmers and community development in Tanzania through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The results showed that the scheme helped smallholder farmers increase the rice production and brought better market opportunities. The farmers' net income was also increased. Profit generated from rice farming not only improved the livelihoods of smallholder farmers but also created more employment opportunities in the rural communities. The research also revealed that the scheme was faced with a number of challenges due to resource and institutional constraints and low-level human capacity for both management and members. The research provides a feasible approach to effective management of small-scale agricultural infrastructure for poverty reduction in Africa.},

abstract = {Increasing irrigation efficiency is often assumed to be a means of saving water and a route to increasing irrigated agricultural production or making water available for other purposes, such as communities, industry or ecosystems. There is a growing body of literature arguing that increasing irrigation efficiency does not reduce consumptive water use in agriculture, implying that no additional water is made available for supporting environmental flows. However, understanding the implications of changes in irrigation efficiency for environmental flows requires assessment at temporal and spatial scales between the daily to seasonal field level analysis of advocates for increasing irrigation efficiency to save water, and the annual basin scale view of some of its critics. When investigated at these intermediate temporal and spatial scales, there may be potential for improvements in irrigation efficiency to mitigate the effects of irrigation on flow timings to an ecologically meaningful extent. In situations where this is possible, in advance of implementing irrigation efficiency programmes, overall water consumption must be limited by an effective water allocation regime that explicitly recognises environmental flow needs in order to prevent expansion or intensification of irrigated agriculture. This paper sets out some of the key issues that practitioners working on environmental flows should consider in order to assess whether or not interventions to increase irrigation efficiency can support environmental flow objectives.},

abstract = {The recent severe drought in South Africa forced the different stakeholders to change the behavior of water users through policy interventions. This paper assesses the impact of policy intervention on irrigation agriculture using a modified IFPRI CGE, SWIP – E model and SAM. The result showed that when water restrictions were set it was more profitable to reduce the number of hectares planted and rather apply full irrigation to produce higher yields. The increase of irrigation water tariffs had a minimal impact on yield. The main challenge was the availability of the water, not the policy interventions. The study recommends that without a behavior change of farmers, the water policy interventions will not achieve the desired goal. Governments with different stakeholders should introduce a mechanism to educate farmers and enhance their understanding of the past, current and future trends of water and drought to plan and mitigate unexpected shocks.},

abstract = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) has introduced economic princi-ples for water resource management, including the environmental cost recovery on the basis of the polluter pays principle (PPP). Agriculture, as a potential driver of pres-sures on water bodies, can produce environmental costs. However, the use of water in agriculture can produce ecosystem services (ES), especially through the aquatic sys-tems of the traditional irrigation agro-ecosystem. This work presents a case study of monetary estimation of some ES of aquatic ecosystems linked to irrigation, i.e. irriga-tion canals and fontanili in Lombardy (Italy). Through the choice experiment method, we obtained positive values of willingness to pay for the highest levels of ES analysed. This has an implication in the context of the economic analysis of water uses and the decision-making process within the interventions planning of irrigation efficiency improvement.},

abstract = {Based on evidence from scientific studies, increases in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are a contributing factor to climate change that have global implications. Climate change has the potential of having detrimental effects on environmental quality and sustainability. Canada, as a member of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is committed to reducing its GHG emissions. As a result of this commitment, the Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Program (AGGP) was established to undertake research in order to develop and implement GHG mitigation strategies. The AGGP partnered with the Brace Centre for Water Resource Management to investigate water table management (WTM) systems that could have the potential for increasing yields and reducing GHG emissions. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the on-farm and off-farm costs and benefits of alternate drainage technologies. Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) was used to determine the Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and Benefit Costs Ratio of Controlled drainage with Sub-irrigation (CDSI) and Tile/Field Drainage (FD). The on-farm private benefit-cost analysis was based on data from a project site in St. Emmanuelle, Quebec. The historical yield data were based on data gathered from the site between 1993 and 2014 and projected for the next 20 years (useful life of the irrigation system) prices and costs were projected from 2015 to 2034. There was no statistically significant difference in the yields between the two irrigation systems. The Benefit Cost ratio for installing CDSI was 1.03 and 1.13 for FD. The net present value (NPV) at a 3.75{\%} discount rate was C{\$}713.12 for CDSI and C{\$}1,501.5 for FD. An estimation of off-farm benefits was performed, by incorporating GHG emissions costs into the analysis and the results revealed a Benefit Cost Ratio of 1.01 and 1.12 for CDSI and FD respectively. Based on these results, it would be preferable for farmers to adopt FD, which is the status quo, situation.Alternate abstract:Sur la base des donn{\'{e}}es provenant d'{\'{e}}tudes scientifiques, l'augmentation des gaz {\`{a}} effet de serre (GES) provoque le changement climatique et ont des implications mondiales.

@phdthesis{Akram2015,
abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay studies the economics of drinking water quality and its impact on childhood health. Childhood diarrhea is a major global health crisis and it takes the lives of over a million children every year. Although effective mechanisms such as chlorine tablets exist to reduce childhood diarrhea, there has been a consistent problem in health experiments of maintaining participation amongst poor households. Even when the technology is provided free, households stop using it soon after commencement. We test the hypothesis that participants are not able to see any real effects of chlorine tablets because they do not get a clear signal on efficacy. To this end, we conducted a small field experiment in a poor urban setting (Karachi, Pakistan). The experiment had a simple structure with a control and treatment arm, where both arms received freely delivered chlorine. The major difference between the two arms was that the treatment arm received a visual tool (Info-Tool) which allowed them to track their diarrhea levels in reference to a norm. They used this tool before receiving tablets and a few months into receiving tablets, which allowed them to better detect the efficacy of the tablets. Participation rates were significantly and persistently (very long term) higher in the group that received Info-Tool. The results suggest that providing households with clearer signals on the effect of the tablets made the intervention far more successful. This provides a basis for better structured social policy and interventions that look to provide recipients clearer signals on how they benefit so that their decision to participate is more rational.   The second essay looks at the economics of allocative efficiency of irrigation water in agricultural use. Irrigation systems are critical to agricultural systems in semi-arid parts of the developing world. Although there is ample evidence that canal systems fail to reach their design capacity, there have been surprisingly few studies of the allocation efficiency of water within canal systems. Partly this is due to poor data concerning water withdrawals per farm. This study collects refined measures of water withdrawals and finds evidence supporting the hypothesis that farmers near the head of a canal get more water than farmers near the tail. Accounting for the conveyance efficiency of the canal system ameliorates the efficiency loss somewhat. The analysis builds a strong evidence-based case that water is not allocated efficiently now within the canal. The results suggest that improvements in canal water management or an internal water market would yield efficiency gains for the canal.   The third essay studies the economics of farmer adaptation to heterogeneous canal water allocation. We use a unique dataset to analyze the impact of heterogeneous surface irrigation water supply on farmer choices in a large canal irrigation system in a developing country (Pakistan). Rather than rely on inaccurate and imprecise farmer perceptions, we collected carefully measured data on farmer water use through in-season physical volumetric measurements of surface water delivered. Additionally, agriculture production surveys on large canal systems often rely on farmer reports of location on the system (distance from origin), which can be accurate for a farmer's reported location on the local canal segment her plot is on but can be noisy for reported on location along the overall system. Thus, along with an improved water measure, we also collected precise measurements of farmer location on the canal system allowing for a better sense for distance from the origin.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation with 3{\%} Hydrogen Peroxide solution on early complications of rhinoplasty. Volunteers who had physical status of ASA I were included in the study after informed written consent. This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Standard open rhinoplasty technique was performed for all patients. All patients underwent the same general anesthesia and post-operative analgesic protocol and the only difference between the two studied groups was the use of hydrogen peroxide for irrigation at the end of surgery. Finally, patients were examined for edema, inflammation, ecchymosis, and infections during 8 weeks after surgery. 50 volunteers (43 female and 7 male) with the mean age of 27.84 ± 7.64 were included in this study. Edema scores were constantly lower in the intervention group (p {\textless} 0.001), so was the median inflammation score (p {\textless} 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in ecchymosis between the two groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). No cases of post-operative infection were reported in any of the study groups. In conclusion, within the limitations of the study, it seems that irrigation with H2O2 should be applied whenever appropriate, because of its potential positive effects.},

abstract = {The fertilizer subsidies reintroduced in various sub-Saharan African countries from 2007 aim to increase agricultural production and assist in the development of fertilizer markets. The present study evaluates the impact of a fertilizer subsidy program among farmers in Ghana who employ highly mechanized irrigation systems. The results indicate that farmers who received fertilizer under the subsidy program used 45{\%} more fertilizer. However, they did not use more weedicide and were likely to reduce investment in soil and water conservation. Thus, the income gains resulting from the subsidy programs were not invested in such non-targeted inputs. Moreover, the program beneficiaries' reduced investment in soil and water conservation may explain the finding that the subsidy did not improve their productivity. Thus, since fertilizer subsidy programs alone may not improve productivity, it may be necessary to target spending explicitly on complementary inputs such as investing in soil and water conservation.},

of action to the commonly used phenylamide-based products were examined
for efficacy on both crops. Cymoxanil + mancozeb + oxadixyl and

application as a drench treatment was better than as a spray. Good
control was also achieved on blackberry with chlorothalonil and with
metalaxyl in formulation with either thirarn or mancozeb. There was no
evidence of loss of control with phenylamide fungicides due to
resistance. Irrigation regimes were also examined on blackberry and

significantly lower disease levels than those found where plants had
been irrigated by overhead sprinklers. Reducing the density of
container-grown rose plants had a measurable effect on the progress of
downy mildew, though this was small and temporary when compared with the
effect of fungicide treatment. Fungicide programmes which gave
season-long control of rose downy mildew resulted in significantly
improved extension growth.},

abstract = {Water scarcity is a significant problem faced by producers worldwide and is becoming an increasing problem to growers in the U.S. peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) producing areas due to years of drought and increasing urban demands on water resources. Because of this, high water-use efficiency (WUE) has now become a priority in many peanut breeding programs. To support this effort, the variation in WUE, as measured by carbon isotope composition ($\delta$13C), of three commonly grown peanut cultivars was evaluated under differing irrigation environments during 2001 and 2002 at a research farm in Shellman, GA, U.S.A. The specific experimental objectives were: 1) to determine if genetic variability existed in $\delta$13C, $\delta$15N SLA, and SPAD among three commonly grown U.S. peanut genotypes; 2) to determine if differing irrigation levels affected the pattern of variability; and 3) to quantify the relationship between $\delta$13C and the measured leaf phenotypic characteristics. During both 2001 and 2002, cv. Georgia Green had significantly higher yields and lower $\delta$13C and SPAD chlorophyll content than the other two genotypes, and lower {\%}N than the cultivar C99R. Specific leaf area and {\%}C for Georgia Green were significantly greater than for the cultivar AT201. In addition, irrigation treatment significantly affected yield such that the NI (nonirrigated) treatment yields were significantly lower than any of the irrigated treatments (33{\%}, 66{\%}, or 100{\%}). However, the irrigation effects on leaf phenotypic characteristics were less apparent with differences existing only for $\delta$15N, SPAD chlorophyll, and SLA. The correlation of $\delta$13C and yield was significant for C99R in 2001 and AT201 in 2002, while correlations with $\delta$13C and the other leaf phenotypic characteristics were scarce. This makes the utility of the traits as easily measured surrogates for WUE very limited.},

abstract = {IntroductionRates of osteoarthritis and total joint arthroplasty (TJA) are on the rise globally. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the most devastating complication of TJA. A number of different intraoperative interventions have been proposed in an effort to reduce infection rates, including antibiotic cements, local antibiotic powder, and various irrigation solutions. The evidence on the importance of irrigation solutions is limited but has gained prominence recently, including the publication of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of various irrigation solutions and pressures at reducing the rates of PJI.MethodsA systematic review was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. All records were screened in duplicate. Data collected included basic study characteristics, the details of the intervention and comparison solutions, if applicable, and rates of superficial and deep infection. A meta-analysis of comparative studies was performed to assess for consistency and potential direction of effect. ResultsA total of ten studies were included, of which one was an RCT, eight were retrospective cohorts, and one was a case series. In total, there were 29,630 TJAs in 29,596 patients. The mean age ranged from 61 to 80 years. Six studies compared povidone-iodine (Betadine{\textregistered}) to normal saline, two studies compared chlorhexidine to saline, one study compared “triple prophylaxis” to standard practice, and one study used gentamicin but had no comparison group. The pooled risk ratio for deep infection in studies using Betadine{\textregistered} compared to saline was 0.62 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.33-1.19), while for chlorhexidine it was 0.74 (95{\%}CI: 0.33-1.65).DiscussionCurrent evidence on the relative efficacy of irrigating solutions as prophylaxis for infection following TJA remains inconclusive. Imprecision of estimates vindicates the need for a definitive trial to further inform their use in surgical practice. ConclusionAntiseptic irrigation during TJA with solutions (Betadine{\textregistered}, chlorhexidine) may decrease PJI risk in patients undergoing primary and revision total hip and knee arthroplasties. Wide confidence intervals and heterogeneity among studies, however, render conclusions untrustworthy. Well-conducted RCTs are very much needed to help further investigate this issue.},

Results of the investigations show that irrigation scheduling and the water stress imposed during different stages of growth influenced the ripening dynamics of Virginia tobacco leaves and that severe water stress causes delay in the ripening of the leaves. Favorable moisture conditions considerably decrease the nicotine and nitrogen content of the Virginia tobacco leaves, both of which are hazardous for humans, to the ranges of 0.85-1.21{\%} versus 2.1-2.2{\%} under stress (for nicotine), and 1.4-1.6{\%} versus 1.8-2.0{\%}, and 2.0-2.4{\%} versus 2.9-3.1{\%} (for nitrogen) for 2001 and 2003, respectively.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sterile ozonated saline endometrial irrigation on sonographic and histological endometrial parameters. This prospective investigation was performed in 12 healthy, ovulating women over three consecutive menstrual cycles: control cycle (endometrial irrigation with 10 cc of normal saline at day 10), no intervention cycle and study cycle (irrigation with 10 cc of sterile ozonated saline at day 10). Endometrial thickness was measured by transvaginal ultrasound at days 10 and 12 of the control and study cycles, and endometrial samplings were obtained from the participants two days after the irrigations (i.e. on day 12) for histological evaluation. Ozonated saline irrigation, compared to normal saline irrigation, resulted in a statistically significant elevation of the columnar epithelial height (30.30±3.04 vs. 25.82±3.28 $\mu$m, p{\textless}0.003), increased number of endometrial blood vessels (30.48±11.38 vs. 19.12±8.74, p{\textless}0.005) and increased number of stromal cells (191.30±34.40 vs. 151.29±29.98, p{\textless}0.01). In conclusion, sterile ozonated saline irrigation of the endometrium has a significant favourable effect on various histological endometrial parameters. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of these changes on endometrial receptivity and pregnancy rates.},

abstract = {One critical challenge facing the world is the need to satisfy the food requirements of the dramatically growing population. Drought stress is one of the main limiting factors in the wheat-producing regions; therefore, wheat yield stability is a major objective of wheat-breeding programs in Jordan, which experience fluctuating climatic conditions in the context of global climate change. In the current study, a two-year field experiment was conducted for exploring the effect of four different water regimes on the yield, yield components, and stability of three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; T. durum Desf.) Jordanian cultivars as related to Canopy Temperature Depression (CTD), and Chlorophyll Content (measured by Soil-Plant Analysis Development, SPAD). A split plot design was used in this experiment with four replicates. Water treatment was applied as the main factor: with and without supplemental irrigation; 0{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%} of field capacity were applied. Two durum wheat cultivars and one bread wheat cultivar were split over irrigation treatments as a sub factor. In both growing seasons, supplemental irrigation showed a significant increase in grain yield compared to the rain-fed conditions. This increase in grain yield was due to the significantly positive effect of water availability on yield components. Values of CTD, SPAD, harvest index, and water use efficiency (WUE) were increased significantly with an increase in soil moisture and highly correlated with grain yield. Ammon variety produced the highest grain yield across the four water regimes used in this study. This variety was characterized by the least thermal time to maturity and the highest values of CTD and SPAD. It was concluded that Ammon had the highest stability among the cultivars tested. Furthermore, CTD and SPAD can be used as important selection parameters in breeding programs in Jordan to assist in developing high-yielding genotypes under drought and heat stress conditions.},

abstract = {Flood irrigation in the winter has been widely applied in northwest China for several years, but little attention has been paid to the flood irrigation program to date. In order to seek a reasonable irrigation quota, a flood irrigation experiment using two common quotas (1,800 and 1,200 m3 ha-1) was conducted in an area irrigated by saline water in the Nanjiang basin with shallow groundwater. Soil electrical conductivity in six treatments irrigated by saline water, with various salinity backgrounds, was investigated using Hydra and DDS-307 before and after flood irrigation. The results indicate that the quota of 12,00 m3 ha-1 was small enough to prevent soil salt from leaching out of the root zone. Although the quota of 1,800 m3 ha-1 may guarantee regular plant growth in the following year, it resulted in at least 267.2 g m-2 of salt entering the shallow groundwater. Therefore, flood irrigation had an important and profound effect on plants, soil environment, and shallow groundwater. The quota of flood irrigation in winter should be determined cautiously according to the hydraulic characteristics and salt background of the soil.},

abstract = {The study was aimed at determining the most suitable irrigation schedule program for hemp grown for fibers by using evaporation from the free water surface (Eo), measured by a Class A pan and related crop plant coefficient (Kc). The experiment, carried out in Vojvodina, a northern part of the Republic of Serbia, included three irrigation regimes: I1, I2, and I3 corresponding, respectively, to daily evaporation from an open water surface (Eo), two interrow spacings: RS1 (12.5 cm) and RS2 (25 cm), and topped (T) and not topped (NT) variants. The Kc values used for the calculation of daily evapotranspiration (ETd) were 0.42 for April and May and 1.00 (I1), 0.80 (I2), and 0.60 (I3) from June to the harvest. In addition, the nonirrigated (Io) control variant was also included in the trial. The dioecious fiber hemp variety Marina was used for the trials. Irrigation was carried out by a drip irrigation system and was scheduled based on the water budget method. It started when readily available water (RAW) in the soil layer of 0.4 m was completely depleted by the plants. In the first year of the study, irrigation did not influence the yield of hemp fiber, but in the second one, the best result was achieved for the irrigation variant I1. Interrow spacing did not have a statistically significant effect on both the hemp fiber yield and the quality. The topping of plants significantly decreased the yield of hemp, and it is not recommended when the hemp is cultivated for fibers. The quality of the hemp fibers was not influenced by irrigation, inter-row spacing, and topping. The rate of hemp evapotranspiration was in an interval of 312 mm (ETa) to 520 mm (ETm). The highest values of IWUE and ETWUE in both years and the bark yield in the first year were detected for the I3 irrigation variant, which suggested that the crop plant coefficient (Kc) of 0.6 could be recommended for the correction of Eo values in the calculation of the daily evapotranspiration of hemp (ETd) from June to August. The yield response factor (Ky) with values of 0.22 and 0.60 for the total growing season reveals that, in rainy years, hemp for fiber production could be grown without irrigation in the temperate climate of the Vojvodina region. However, such years are rare. Without doubt, irrigation of fiber hemp is recommended in the mentioned region in order to obtain high yields of good quality product.},

Between December 2010 and April 2011, 53 children with constipation, fecal incontinence or both underwent a stepwise bowel management program at our spina bifida clinic. The children and their caregivers were evaluated before and after this program using a self-administered questionnaire.   Among the children, 11.3{\%} received only oral laxatives and controlled well, 88.7{\%} received transanal irrigation. After this program, the mean number of episodes of fecal incontinence per week, number of diaper changes and total time for bowel care decreased from 6.9 to 0.5 (P=0.004), from 1.6 to 0.2 (P=0.001) and from 27 to 15.9min (P=0.003), respectively. Caregivers and children were able to leave their houses more often (P=0.006), and caregivers' bothersomeness, anxiety and depression due to bowel care decreased (P{\textless}0.001). Factors related to family relationships (P=0.265) and financial impact (P=0.071) improved, but not significantly.   We observed significant improvement in defecation symptoms and QOL scores of spina bifida patients who underwent this program. We recommend that this simple therapeutic method be considered as a safe and valid choice for the treatment of chronic constipation and fecal incontinence.},

abstract = {Agriculture uses more water than any other human activity in the world. Projections of increasing demands on agriculture along with climatic change and variability necessitate evaluating the current and potential contributions of irrigation water to agriculture, and initiatives to improve production while reducing our demands on surface and groundwater systems. This thesis develops and demonstrates new procedures to determine appropriate estimates of agricultural production and water use resulting from proposed changes in irrigation water use. This research improves on previous efforts to evaluate the increasing or decreasing of full irrigation at regional-scale, and presents the first broadly-applicable methodology for evaluating supplemental irrigation at nested spatiotemporal scales.Irrigation has generally been evaluated at its extremes, defining areas exclusively as either fully irrigated or non-irrigated. Previous efforts to estimate the contributions of irrigation to current yields and evaluate potential changes in production have determined generalizations relating irrigated and non-irrigated yields from temporally and spatially limited statistical data. Such efforts have admittedly limited their investigations by evaluating only the extremes of irrigation and further by correlating the separate contributions of surface water and groundwater to production. This research first improves on estimating the potential of the extremes, that is increasing or decreasing full irrigation, by evaluating changes in irrigated area as they relate specifically to irrigation-source. Further, this research develops and demonstrates the first broadly-applicable methodologies for evaluating the in-betweens of full and non-irrigation, namely supplemental irrigation. Supplemental irrigation holds significant opportunity to increase agricultural and water productivity, and reduce water use. By recognising a system of irrigation different than the extremes, including potentially reducing water use on irrigated fields and increasing limited water use on non-irrigated fields at appropriate and opportune times, the in-betweens of irrigation allow for the benefits of supporting production while not necessarily further appropriating water for irrigation.This thesis first evaluates the potential changes in agricultural production and water use resulting from the complete expansion of full irrigation under two scenarios related to the adoption of specific irrigation sources, demonstrated for rice and wheat in India. The results show a potential increase in production of 14-25{\%} for rice and 3{\%} for wheat, with a 31{\%} and 3{\%} increase in water use respectively. Similarly, the study investigates the decreases in agricultural production from stopping irrigation, and we estimate that rice would be at 60{\%} of current production, and wheat at 51{\%}. Together, these two evaluations showcase the end ranges of the relationship between agricultural production and irrigation water use. Specifically, this is achieved by partitioning region-specific rice and wheat production into that related to irrigated and non-irrigated areas, and further by irrigation source. This partitioning of production by irrigation source, to the best of our knowledge, is novel. The partitions are used to estimate potential increases in agricultural production, and evaluating such increases as explicitly related to irrigation source, is similarly novel.Supplemental irrigation holds the space between the extremes of full and nonirrigation: water use is potentially reduced on fully irrigated fields, previously non-irrigated fields invite limited irrigation, and the net result can potentially significantly increase water productivity and decrease water use. This thesis is the first to demonstrate methodologies to evaluate supplemental irrigation as a regional initiative and at nested spatiotemporal xxiii scales. Evaluating this initiative necessitates determining the relationship between water use and crop yield under soil moisture deficit conditions, recognised as the crop-water production function. Previous efforts have endeavored to determine these relationships solely with the development of general functions or by field experiment which necessarily limits and biases the temporal distributions of water use investigated – neither approach appropriately acknowledges the effects of irrigation scheduling. This thesis develops two broadly applicable methodologies to determine crop- and region-specific crop-water production functions with the introduction of crop kites, defined as the complete space of crop yield-water use relationships for crops grown under soil moisture deficit conditions, and acknowledges explicitly the temporal distributions of water use.First, crop kites are constructed using generally available empirical crop and evapotranspiration data to facilitate regional evaluations of supplemental irrigation, and is demonstrated for wheat production in northern Tunisia. Specific crop-water production functions are derived from the crop kite, and the irrigation schedules of optimized distribution, even distribution throughout the growing season, and water use distributed preferentially towards earlier growth stages are compared.Second, the procedure to construct crop kites with a calibrated crop-water model is developed and demonstrated with Aquacrop. The ability to tailor the crop-water model for different agroclimatic conditions facilitates spatiotemporal evaluations of supplemental irrigation across different and nested scales, and is demonstrated for spring wheat production for the Oldman River Watershed of southern Alberta, Canada. Optimized cropwater production functions are determined and the historical potential increases in agricultural and water productivities achieved from adopting both a practice of xxiv supplemental irrigation and a spatial redistribution of irrigation water within the watershed, are estimated. The results show that the average potential savings in irrigation water use while maintaining year-specific production is 78{\%}, and the average potential increase in spring wheat production while maintaining year-specific irrigation water use is 27{\%}, both with the most opportunity in dry years.The significance of this doctoral thesis is the development and demonstration of broadly applicable methodologies to effectively determine estimates of agricultural production and water use resulting from proposed changes to irrigation water use. The increased capacity for evaluations of the extremes and in-betweens of irrigation water will be of interest to agricultural practitioners, water managers, policy makers, and researchers interested in better understanding and improving upon the relationship between water use and agricultural production.Alternate abstract:L'agriculture est l'activit{\'{e}} humaine qui utilise le plus d'eau au monde.  Les projections de demande croissante d'agriculture, au m{\^{e}}me titre que les changements et la variabilit{\'{e}} du climat, n{\'{e}}cessitent une {\'{e}}valuation des contributions pr{\'{e}}sentes et potentielles d'irrigation d{\'{e}}di{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} l'agriculture ainsi que des initiatives pour am{\'{e}}liorer la production tout en r{\'{e}}duisant nos demandes sur les syst{\`{e}}mes d'eaux de surfaces et souterraines. Cette th{\`{e}}se d{\'{e}}veloppe et d{\'{e}}montre de nouvelles proc{\'{e}}dures afin d'estimer la production agricole et la consommation d'eau r{\'{e}}sultant des changements propos{\'{e}}s en irrigation. Ces proc{\'{e}}dures am{\'{e}}liorent les efforts ant{\'{e}}rieurs pour {\'{e}}valuer l'augmentation ou la r{\'{e}}duction d'irrigation totale {\`{a}} une {\'{e}}chelle r{\'{e}}gionale.  De plus, elles {\'{e}}valuent de fa{\c{c}}on innovatrice une irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire {\`{a}} des {\'{e}}chelles spatio-temporelles. L'irrigation est g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralement {\'{e}}valu{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} ses extr{\^{e}}mes, en d{\'{e}}finissant les aires d'agriculture compl{\`{e}}tement irrigu{\'{e}}es ou non-irrigu{\'{e}}es. L'estimation des contributions d'irrigation aux cultures pr{\'{e}}sentes et l'{\'{e}}valuation des changements potentiels de rendement, tels que fait anciennement, ont pu d{\'{e}}terminer les g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisations reli{\'{e}}es entre les cultures des aires irrigu{\'{e}}es et non-irrigu{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} partir d'une banque de donn{\'{e}}es statistiques limit{\'{e}}e, provenant principalement des {\'{E}}tats-Unis.   Ces investigations ant{\'{e}}rieures sont limit{\'{e}}es car elles n'{\'{e}}valuaient que les extr{\^{e}}mes d'irrigation et corr{\'{e}}laient les contributions s{\'{e}}par{\'{e}}es de l'eau de surface et de l'eau souterraine {\`{a}} la production agricole.  La pr{\'{e}}sente recherche am{\'{e}}liore premi{\`{e}}rement les {\'{e}}valuations du potentiel de rendement agricole aux extr{\^{e}}mes d'irrigation en reconnaissant les contributions s{\'{e}}par{\'{e}}es des eaux de surfaces et des eaux souterraines {\`{a}} la production. Deuxi{\`{e}}mement, cette th{\`{e}}se d{\'{e}}veloppe et d{\'{e}}montre les premi{\`{e}}res m{\'{e}}thodes largement applicables pour l'{\'{e}}valuation du rendement agricole des zones interm{\'{e}}diaires entre les aires compl{\`{e}}tement irrigu{\'{e}}es et celles non-irrigu{\'{e}}es, c'est-{\`{a}}-dire l'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire. L'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire rend possible l'augmentation de la productivit{\'{e}} agricole tout en r{\'{e}}duisant la consommation d'eau.  L'adoption d'un syst{\`{e}}me d'irrigation autre que les extr{\^{e}}mes qui prend en compte des param{\`{e}}tres tels une potentielle baisse de consommation d'eau dans les champs irrigu{\'{e}}s et une hausse de consommation d'eau dans les champs non-irrigu{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} de moments opportuns, cr{\'{e}}e des zones interm{\'{e}}diaires d'irrigation et permet ainsi un support accru pour la production tout en minimisant l'irrigation. Cette th{\`{e}}se {\'{e}}value en premier lieu les changements potentiels en production agricole et de consommation d'eau suite {\`{a}} une expansion compl{\`{e}}te d'irrigation en utilisant deux sc{\'{e}}narios reli{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} l'adoption de sources d'irrigation sp{\'{e}}cifiques, et ce, d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}} pour le riz et le bl{\'{e}} en Inde. Les r{\'{e}}sultats d{\'{e}}montrent une augmentation potentielle de rendement de 14-25{\%} pour le riz et 3{\%} pour le bl{\'{e}} associ{\'{e}} {\`{a}} une augmentation d'irrigation de 31{\%} et 3{\%} respectivement. L'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire se situe entre les extr{\^{e}}mes d'irrigation compl{\`{e}}te et nulle : la consommation d'eau est potentiellement r{\'{e}}duite dans les champs compl{\`{e}}tement irrigu{\'{e}}s, les champs ant{\'{e}}rieurement non-irrigu{\'{e}}s invitent une irrigation limit{\'{e}}e et le r{\'{e}}sultat net peut potentiellement consid{\'{e}}rablement augmenter l'efficacit{\'{e}} d'utilisation d'eau et, par le fait m{\^{e}}me, diminuer la consommation d'eau. Pour {\'{e}}valuer les r{\'{e}}sultats de cette initiative, la relation entre la consommation d'eau et le rendement des cultures en d{\'{e}}ficit en humidit{\'{e}} du sol, connu comme la fonction de production culture-eau, doit {\^{e}}tre {\'{e}}valu{\'{e}}e. Les efforts pr{\'{e}}c{\'{e}}dents s'effor{\c{c}}aient {\`{a}} d{\'{e}}terminer ces relations uniquement en d{\'{e}}veloppant des fonctions g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rales ou par des exp{\'{e}}riences de terrain. In{\'{e}}vitablement, cela limitait et biaisait la distribution temporelle de consommation d'eau investigu{\'{e}}e, car aucune de ces approches ne reconnaissent ad{\'{e}}quatement les effets du calendrier d'irrigation. Cette th{\`{e}}se d{\'{e}}veloppe deux m{\'{e}}thodes largement applicables pour d{\'{e}}terminer les fonctions de production culture-eau sp{\'{e}}cifiques {\`{a}} une culture et {\`{a}} une r{\'{e}}gion {\`{a}} l'aide de cerfs-volants de culture. Ce nouveau concept est d{\'{e}}fini comme l'espace total de la relation entre le rendement des cultures et la consommation d'eau associ{\'{e}}e dans des conditions de d{\'{e}}ficit en humidit{\'{e}} du sol, tout en tenant compte de la distribution temporelle de consommation d'eau. Premi{\`{e}}rement, les cerfs-volants de culture sont construits en utilisant g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralement les donn{\'{e}}es empiriques et d'{\'{e}}vapotranspiration pour faciliter les {\'{e}}valuations r{\'{e}}gionales d'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire et ceci est d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}} pour la production de bl{\'{e}} dans le nord de la Tunisie. Les fonctions de production culture-eau sont d{\'{e}}riv{\'{e}}es directement des cerfsvolants de culture et les diff{\'{e}}rents sc{\'{e}}narios de calendrier d'irrigation suivants sont compar{\'{e}}s : une distribution optimis{\'{e}}e, une distribution constante pendant la saison de xxviii croissance et finalement une distribution au premier stage de croissance. Deuxi{\`{e}}mement, la proc{\'{e}}dure de construction des cerfs-volants de culture avec un model culture-eau calibr{\'{e}} est d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}e avec l'aide du programme Aquacrop. La capacit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} adapter la mod{\'{e}}lisation culture-eau {\`{a}} diff{\'{e}}rentes conditions agro-climatiques facilite les {\'{e}}valuations spatio-temporelles d'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire de diff{\'{e}}rentes {\'{e}}chelles juxtapos{\'{e}}es et ceci est d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}} pour la production de bl{\'{e}} de printemps dans le bassin versant de la rivi{\`{e}}re Oldman dans le sud de l'Alberta, Canada. Les fonctions optimis{\'{e}}es de production culture-eau sont d'abord d{\'{e}}termin{\'{e}}e. Ensuite, les accroissements historiques potentiels de rendement agricole et d'utilisation d'eau r{\'{e}}sultant d'une pratique d'irrigation compl{\'{e}}mentaire ainsi que d'une redistribution spatiale d'eau d'irrigation dans l'aire du bassin versant sont estim{\'{e}}s. Les r{\'{e}}sultats d{\'{e}}montrent que la moyenne des {\'{e}}conomies potentielles en consommation d'eau, tout en maintenant le rendement agricole annuel, est de 78{\%} et que la moyenne des augmentations potentielles de production de bl{\'{e}} de printemps, tout en maintenant l'irrigation annuelle, est de 27{\%}. Dans les deux cas, il est possible d'obtenir un meilleur rendement dans les saisons de s{\'{e}}cheresse.},

abstract = {Considering water as an economic good entails, among other requisites, properly assessing the cost incurred by supplying and managing the resource, and the required infrastructure thereof. Regarding irrigation, the International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) set up a method for assessing the full financial costs, in the form of guidelines. This paper investigates the applicability of these guidelines in smallholder irrigation conditions in developing countries. The paper first presents the specific conditions and features of such a sector, with emphasis on South African examples. Several specific issues are identified and discussed, such as the lack of records on infrastructure and initial costs, the multiple purpose and actual uses of certain equipment and infrastructure, the shift in purpose of others over time, the inclusion of certain small, yet indispensable equipment in the calculation, the partial refurbishment works on particular assets, and the lack of a standard basis for calculation under tropical, developing conditions (e.g. on service life, maintenance requirements). Secondly, after a brief review of current frameworks, concepts and terminology, the paper attempts to apply the existing guidelines developed by ICID for evaluating financial costs of irrigation services on a case study in South Africa. The results suggest that the application of the guidelines is feasible, provided that some adapted data and available information replace the original set, especially for capital costs. This applies to the discount rate, calculation of the current value, and estimation of the service life of infrastructure and equipment. In particular, several scenarios have been tested in order to identify a surrogate to the discount rate. The average yield on Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCD) is suggested as a surrogate for treasury bills and hence as a substitute for the discount rate. The case study demonstrates the high costs of irrigation services compared to the low income derived from irrigation production in smallholder schemes and hence the need for renewed public intervention and subsidisation, especially on account of the current context of management transfer, privatisation, and liberalisation. The paper suggests a shift in the underlying policy and societal mindset about the water charging system for smallholder irrigation. Cost recovery and water charges should not be considered as being a further burden or deterring factor for smallholder irrigation, but rather as an incentive towards increasing production and ultimately improving their contribution to the country's economy.},

abstract = {PurposeThe objective of this study is to estimate the impacts of access to irrigation on farm income, household income and income diversification.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to address the selection bias arising from both observed and unobserved factors and analyze cross-sectional data collected from Fujian, Henan and Sichuan provinces in China. The authors use the Simpson index to measure household income diversification. The propensity score matching (PSM) model and control function approach are also used for comparison purpose.FindingsAfter controlling for the selection bias, the authors find that access to irrigation has a positive and statistically significant impact on rural incomes and diversification. The treatment effects of access to irrigation are to increase farm income, household income and income diversification by around 14, 10 and 107{\%}, respectively. The positive effects of access to irrigation are confirmed by the estimates of the PSM model and control function approach. Further analysis reveals that the irrigation effects on rural incomes and diversification are heterogeneous between small-scale and large-scale farmers and between male-headed and female-headed households.Practical implicationsThe authors' findings suggest that the government should continue to improve irrigation infrastructure construction in rural China to promote smallholder farmers' water access and at the same time facilitate farmers' access to better agronomic and irrigation information. There exist gender and farm size related income and diversification effects of access to irrigation, and the irrigation access is associated with farm location. Thus, when developing regional irrigation programs consideration needs to be taken of whether the rural farming systems are dominated by male/female household heads and land fragmentation/consolidation issues.Originality/valueAlthough a large body of literature has investigated the effects of irrigation development in rural areas, little is known about the impact of access to irrigation on income diversification. The selection bias associated with unobserved heterogeneities is usually neglected in previous studies. This study provides the first attempt by examining the impacts of access to irrigation on rural incomes and diversification, using the ESR model to address both observed and unobserved selection bias.},

abstract = {The study was conducted to examine impact of irrigation on poverty alleviation and its determinants on the use of water resources in South Wollo. Gerado small-scale irrigation canal was purposively selected in two Kebele Administrations. Data was collected from 150 farmers and a Propensity score matching econometric model analysis was carried out. The outcome variables were household consumption expenditure and asset building mainly livestock. A logistic robust regression model was fitted to analyze the potential variables affecting household participation in the programme in the study area. Among 10 explanatory variables included in the logistic model, 6 of them were significant. The result indicated that programme participation and the daily calorie intake of the households in the area were significantly influenced by farm size, labor availability; access to extension service, age and size of the household. The programme intervention resulted in a positive and statically significant mean difference between two groups in terms of the outcomes variables daily calorie intake in terms of consumption expenditure and livestock holding. The logit result revealed that the food security of the household was improved by irrigation programme intervention in the study area. The multiple linear regression model estimated results revealed that households who had a larger farm size, frequently contacted office of agricultural extension agents, and had some labor available in farming were less likely to be food in-secure. However, the older the age of the household and the larger the household sizes were, the more likely to be food insecure. Accordingly, access to irrigation through small and large scale irrigation must be ensured to increase productivity and hence reduce and alleviate poverty in the region. This would help to adapt to the increasing hostile climate change the country is facing. People are poor due to shortage of resources or inability to use them. Therefore, farm household asset formation and provision of extension and credit services should be given priority. Such actions may, in turn, alleviate the current problem of food insecurity and lead in the long run to economic development. Population planning intervention along with holistic approach to improve the education level is needed to overcome the poverty problem.},

But the intervention of modern irrigation techniques has disrupted the entire oasis system inside the oasis such as the spring, the palm grove and the ksar. These techniques have overexploited the groundwater supplying the palm grove in terms of quantity and quality.For centuries, the oases of Mougheul used only the source (with a flow of 25 dm3∙s−1 in 2001) which is inside the oasis to irrigate the parcels and herds. After the year 2005, the state decided to supply the city of Bechar with drinking water through the catchment field of Mougheul through five modern boreholes, which had a profound impact on the oasis, its surroundings, and the whole artesian source.In this work, we study the impact of the use of modern catchment systems on the water source and the life of the Mougheul population.

The results are important to determining whether programs and contracts that reduce input price uncertainty may deter the adoption of conservation practices. An economic model of the technology adoption decision shows that the net effect of input price risk is ambiguous and depends on several factors including the shutdown effect, the mean price effect, the precision expansion effect, and the risk aversion effect. An empirical implementation of the model relies on data on water price and irrigation technology adoption observed in a California irrigation district over the period 1999-2002.

abstract = {The development of smallholder irrigation is a policy priority in Ethiopia, yet little consideration has been given to the role state interventions play in enabling or constraining effective self‐governance in farmer‐managed schemes. To address this gap in evidence, research was conducted in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, in two irrigation sites. Focus group discussions and semi‐structured interviews with key informants were the primary means of collecting data on local institutional arrangements, government interventions and management challenges. An opinion poll provided additional insights. Our case studies indicate that effective self‐governance cannot easily be crafted by external actors. The introduction of modern irrigation technologies and formalized management arrangements has fostered dependency on external support and increased state influence in key decision‐making processes, whilst traditional water user associations remain largely autonomous but have little access to financial resources. State interventions have also been poorly tailored to local context with negative consequences for performance, although there have been some successes where traditional arrangements for water management have been integrated into new institutions. The incorporation of farmer perspectives into performance assessments could facilitate more responsive interventions, and remains an important area of irrigation research and practice.

abstract = {This paper relies on data associated 2,100 agricultural land sale transactions across two
major Nebraska Watersheds (the Republican and Central Platte) over the 2000 to 2008
time period. The sales were spatially referenced (digitized into a GIS) in order to quantify
and geo-spatially predict and map the implicit values of irrigation through the use of
hedonic price modeling. Marginal implicit prices vary substantially across subwatersheds
(natural resource districts), and the contribution of irrigation to sale prices is
directly related to the extent to dependency of production agriculture on irrigation.
This information is now currently being used to evaluate the economic efficiency of
recent irrigation retirement programs and to help ensure that current and future retirement
programs are cost-effective through targeting that retires irrigation land with the greatest
hydrologic impact on water resources for the lowest cost.},

abstract = {Background  Insecticide resistance is the major emerging challenge facing the malaria vector control programmes in Tanzania. Proper monitoring and detection is of paramount importance guiding the vector control programmes. This paper presents the effect of mosquito aging on insecticide resistance status in Anopheles arabiensis populations in dry and rainy seasons in northern Tanzania. Methods Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae were sampled from rice fields in both dry and rainy seasons and reared in the insectary to adults. The emerged females in batches of 2, 3, 5, and 10 days old were exposed to six insecticides (deltamethrin, permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, DDT, bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl) to see the effects of age on insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes were exposed to insecticides using WHO standard susceptibility test kits. Knockdown was recorded during the 1-h exposure, while mortality and resistance ratio were recorded 24 h later. Mosquito specimens were identified to species level using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results Among the 326 specimens processed by PCR, 323 (99.1{\%}) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. There was reduced mortality (ranging from 61 to 97.7{\%}) when adults reared from larvae were exposed to all pyrethroids and bendiocarb in both dry and rainy seasons, while they were fully susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl. There was a significant increase in mortality rate with increase in mosquito's age in both dry and rainy seasons following exposure to pyrethroids (DF = 1, P {\textless} 0.05). Mosquitoes showed significantly higher mortality rates in the rainy season than in the dry season after being exposed to pyrethroids (DF = 1, P {\textless} 0.05). Higher mortality rates (94.0–99.8{\%}) were observed in all ages and seasons when mosquitoes were exposed to bendiocarb compared with pyrethroids. Pirimiphos-methyl was only tested in the rainy season so no comparison with dry season mosquitoes could be made. Conclusions Results showed that An. arabiensis were resistant to pyrethroids in both seasons and that the young age groups exhibited higher levels of resistance compared with the older age groups. Mosquitoes were full susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl irrespective of the season and age.},

abstract = {We examine how irrigation techniques in use by family and friends influence the use and share of land utilizing different irrigation techniques by Arkansas producers. A bivariate sample selection model simultaneously estimates how farm characteristics determine the use and explain the share of a farm that utilizes an irrigation technique. We find that the irrigation techniques in use by family and friends do affect the irrigation techniques a producer uses and the share of acres utilizing different irrigation techniques. A producer with a family or friend that uses end-blocking irrigation is 41{\%} more likely to use end-blocking themselves. Having a family or friend who uses pivot irrigation technology tends to decrease the share of irrigated acres that utilizes end block irrigation by 0.211. We also find that when the irrigation techniques in use by family and friends interact with variables like location and participation in a regional conservation partnership program, the effects on the producer's decision vary.  The share of irrigated acres that use cutback irrigation decreases by 0.21 for a producer who has a peer that uses irrigation scheduling. However, if the producer lives along Crowley's Ridge and has a peer that uses irrigation scheduling, the share of irrigated acres that use cutback irrigation decreases by an additional 0.54.},

abstract = {Cultural landscape has become a new category of cultural heritage since the late twentieth century. However, the conservation interventions usually used in regard to a conventional cultural heritage need to be changed and adapted to preserve the cultural landscape because the nature of landscapes differs to those of conventional cultural heritage, in which monumental buildings and other structures are essential. It is argued that the conservation approach should be broadened; in particular, “people” and “function” are critical factors. The community approach highlights the importance of people and their environment; thereby, the local identity of their life and environment, which comprises the whole nature of a cultural landscape, may be confirmed, and the threats from tourists or external cultural impact may be eased. The Wushantou Reservoir and Jianan Irrigation System were designed by Hatta Yoichi, and built in the 1920s. The reservoir was built under the conditions of the natural environment, and the conservation of an irrigation cultural landscape should not be limited to the structure, i.e., objects or channels. The agricultural production opportunities provided to the local people through the community approach should have a beneficial effect on local identity and the conservation of the cultural landscape.},

abstract = {Irrigation development is essential for reducing vulnerability to water resource scarcity, food insecurity, and climate change impacts in Egypt. The centralized irrigation development must, however, overcome the challenges of the diversity of smallholders and the pre‐existing, individualistic irrigation management. The purpose of this paper is to examine the farmers' characteristics that influence the design and success of irrigation improvement programmes in the Old Lands of Egypt. The paper investigates this issue from the perspectives of farmers by analysing farm features, agricultural practices, irrigation practices, and satisfaction with water services. The clustering method is applied to create farmer groups within the geographical area of the programme and seek consistent differences that affect the outcome of irrigation improvement. The results show that farmers are less diverse in their agrotechnology and more heterogenous in terms of capacities, livelihood sources, and land tenure structures. The article argues that grouping methods to deploy improved irrigation infrastructure should give more consideration to the farmers' individual features. Programmes intended to replicate such irrigation development or leverage the existing results should address these particularities to create a socially adaptive environment for future irrigation investment in Egypt.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Le d{\'{e}}veloppement de l'irrigation est essentiel pour r{\'{e}}duire la vuln{\'{e}}rabilit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} la p{\'{e}}nurie d'eau, {\`{a}} l'ins{\'{e}}curit{\'{e}} alimentaire et aux impacts du changement climatique en {\'{E}}gypte.

abstract = {The water potential ($\Psi$ₚ), has been widely used as an indicator of plant water status for irrigation management purposes. The simple infrastructure needed for its measurement and its direct relation to basic plant physiological processes, have contributed to the popularity of the methodology. When used for irrigation scheduling, it is commonly assumed that an unavoidable relationship exists between plant transpiration (T), soil water content and $\Psi$ₚ. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that variations in $\Psi$ₚ are not solely related to changes in soil water content, but are also an expression of the interaction between the plant and its environment. We used a soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC) model to highlight the importance of considering such interactions through a series of in silico experiments. Our analysis shows that evaporative demand, the hydraulic architecture of the plant, and the texture and depth of the soil play key roles in the final $\Psi$ₚ observed. To establish irrigation programs based on $\Psi$ₚ, without considering the environmental and plant factors that influence it, can create the paradox of having a plant that suffers greater water stress even when high irrigation volumes are applied. The conclusions from our in silico analysis provide some warnings that should be considered when using $\Psi$ₚ to schedule irrigation.},

@phdthesis{Nikku2006,
abstract = {This thesis studies the emergence, process and politics of the Andhra Pradesh reform policy of Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). The reform has been labeled as the 'AP model' of irrigation reforms and supported by external aid agencies like World Bank. Within a short span of time Andhra Pradesh's PIM programe has received internal attention. The program has been seen as a successful model because of the political will and legal bureaucratic support it received and its big-bang approach to implementation. Consequently the reform program influenced the thinking on irrigation management policies in other states within India and abroad.This study investigates the process of PIM policy implemented since 1997 in the state. The objective is to understand the nature and dynamics of the policy process i.e. the role of different actors such as water users, water users' association leaders, politicians, irrigation bureaucrats and their contestation of policy and shaping of courses of action and outcomes. By doing so the study aims to contribute to the general debate on reform policies and particiculary irrigation reform policy in the state of Andhra Pradesh.The thesis is a product of intensive field work carried out from March 2001 to June 2002 with additional field work visits at different intervals during 2002-2004. The research was also benefited by my earlier research work carried out Gujarat Institute of Development Research on PM in Andhra Pradesh during 1999-2000. The first stage concerned a reconnaissance survey of WUAs in the state and a detailed study of WUAs formed on Madhira branch canal under Kalluru and Madhira irrigation sub-divisions. I studied the outcomes of reform policy contestation in key arenas of irrigation management namely, irrigation works, irrigation, expansion (i.e. bridging the gap command) and irrigation revenue assessment ( known as joint Azmoish) in Madhira branch canal. I focused on the day-to-day engagement of the WUA leaders and middle and lower level irrigation bureaucrats with the policy and implementation on the ground. The second stage of field work focused on policy actors at the state capital.The thesis is divided into nine chapters and an epilogue. After the introductory chapter, chapter 2 presents the conceptual framework used for the analysis. The subsequent empirical chapters set out to study the key means of policy implementation and related irrigation management policy process arenas. Chapter 3 discusses the emergence of Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) policy in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Chapter 4 introduces the details of the irrigation and social organisation of Madhira Branch Canal (MBC). The Chapter shows how irrigation organisation linked with local social organisation.Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 are based on empirical analysis and together answer the main research question. Chapter 5 focuses on the first management arena of reform studied of irrigation works. It analyses the process of carrying out physical works (operation and maintenance and minimum rehabilitation works) after the introduction of the PIM programme in the state, and the key actors reshaping outcomes. Chapter 6 focuses on the second irrigation management arena of irrigation expansion and focuses in to government daims on bridging the gap command. Chapter 7 discusses the third irrigation management arena of reform in joint irrigation supervision and revenue collection (joint Azmoish). It examines the role and participation of the Irrigation, Revenue, Agriculture departments and the WUA in a new process created under the reforms through which the extent of area that received canal irrigation in a crop season will be jointly finalised. Chapter 8 returns to the issue of socio-political embeddedness as it reshapes reforms, looking this time at the system-bureaucracy domain and irrigation bureaucrats, especially the field level staff. Chapter 9 is the concluding chapter and summarises the key findings of the research. Many changes have taken place in the irrigation sector after 2002. The Naidu government that introduced the irrigation reforms stalled the elections for WUAs after the completion of their first term in the office. A Congress government came in to power in 2004. As a result there were many changes in the course of irrigation reform policy. I discuss these changes as a brief epilogue to the book.This thesis show how reform policies are interpreted and reconstructed by the participating actors. Initially the reform policies were resisted covertly by middle and lower level of irrigation bureaucrats. They understood that the programme aimed to decentralise their powers and transfer irrigation management activities to water users associations. In process these bureaucrats made alliances with WUA representatives and local leaders and controlled the irrigation management arenas. The lower level bureaucrats could successfully lobby with the higher officials and with government using legal measures and retained their status within the irrigation hierarchy. The irrigation bureaucracy gained more technical and financial powers in the process and retained their control in irrigation management and decision making processes. Hence I argue that, contrary to what is generally expected, PIM in Andhra Pradesh did not lead to participatory management of irrigation resources, but served to preserve or strengthen the actors' interests.},

abstract = {Rice production in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled in the last 3 decades and the potential to further develop rice-harvested areas is considerable. Several studies have demonstrated that the transformation of arable land into rice irrigation might create suitable habitats for large populations of disease vectors. Prominent among those are anopheline mosquitoes responsible for transmission of malaria. The method of irrigation on an intermittent basis during the rice-cropping calendar has gained renewed interest as a potentially effective malaria control strategy since the early 1980s. We review the experiences of the past 80 years with intermittent irrigation in the cultivation of rice. This method has been shown to reduce significantly the density of malaria vectors by curtailing their larval development. Furthermore, reduced methane emissions and water savings with at least equal yields were achieved in intermittently irrigated rice fields. We explore and discuss under what conditions intermittent irrigation might be beneficial in new rice-growing areas and identify steps that have to be taken to expand such programs in the future.},

abstract = {The objectives of this research were to study the association in bread wheat between spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) and grain yield, estimate their heritability, and correlated response to selection (CR) for grain yield estimated from SRIs under reduced irrigation conditions. Reflectance was measured at three different growth stages (booting, heading and grainfilling) and five SRIs were calculated, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR), water index (WI), normalized water index-1 (NWI-1), and normalized water index-2 (NWI-2). Three field experiments were conducted (each with 30 advanced lines) in three different years. Two reduced irrigation environments were created: (1) one-irrigation level (pre-planting), and (2) two-irrigation level (pre-planting and at booting stage), both representing levels of reduced moisture. Maximum yield levels in the experimental zone were generally obtained with 4-6 irrigations. Genotypic variations for all SRIs were significant. Three NIR (near infrared radiation) based indices (WI, NWI-1, and NWI-2) gave the highest level of association (both phenotypic and genotypic) with grain yield under both reduced irrigation environments. Use of the mean SRI values averaged over growth stages and the progressive integration of SRIs from booting to grainfilling increased the capacity to explain variation among genotypes for yield under these reduced irrigation conditions. A higher level of broad-sense heritability was found with the two-irrigation environment (0.80) than with the one-irrigation environment (0.63). Overall, 50{\%} to 75{\%} of the 12.5{\%} highest yielding genotypes, and 50{\%} to 87{\%} of the 25{\%} highest yielding genotypes were selected when the NWI-2 index was applied as an indirect selection tool. Strong genetic correlations, moderate to high heritability, a correlated response for grain yield close to direct selection for grain yield, and a very high efficiency of selecting superior genotypes indicate the potential of using these three SRIs in breeding programs for selecting increased genetic gains in grain yield under reduced irrigation conditions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {In the arid areas of Northwest China, agriculture especially crop farming consumes most of water resource. Water-intensive and low value-added wheat is cultivated as a staple food of the local people in large scale. Because of the surface water scarcity, irrigation mainly depends on pumping the groundwater in these areas. Based on field surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 both in the south and the north of Minqin County, Gansu province, this study is designed to study the role of groundwater irrigation on wheat production and how to improve the technical efficiencies (TEs) of wheat farmers by estimating a Stochastic Frontier Production Function (SFPF). The above information is valuable for how to save wheat water consumption and improving the food safety in the arid areas. The empirical results showed that expenditure on pumping groundwater played important role in wheat production. Meanwhile, the same expenditure played more effectively on wheat intercropping with maize in the south than that in the north. As a result, the farmers in the south are more likely to increase expenditures on pumping water than the farmers in the north. Therefore, the government should make new program to restrict wheat water consumption and to secure the farmers in both areas to use the groundwater fairly. Meanwhile, it is suggested that younger farmers can achieve a higher te both in the south and the north. For the input-intensive intercropping in the south, a larger family, higher education of the farm managers, and coordination of their part-time jobs with agricultural production activities can also help to get higher TEs.},

abstract = {Although considerable agreement exists among scholars about the attributes of a resource and about resource users that are conducive to self-organization, there are also puzzling issues related to the effects of size and heterogeneity of the user group. Prior empirical studies indicate that user-group differences do not have a uniform effect on the likelihood of sustaining collective action. The effects can be either positive, negative, or unrelated to self-organization efforts. Since many of the results are derived from individual case studies, or only a small number of cases, I adopt a more rigorous strategy to address the effect of these variables on self-governance and outcomes. I draw on a relatively large number of cases from two different types of common-pool resources in Nepal -- irrigation and forests -- to explore associations between group heterogeneity (measured in diverse ways) and collective action to address whether local resource management efforts may be affected. Through the use of in-depth case studies, I further examine the institutions governing both types of resource systems in a setting where members from the same community use both resources. Not only does this provide insights into how resource users organize around two different types of resource systems, but also allows us to assess and compare performance of these self-governed common-pool resource institutions. Using data generated by the Nepal Irrigation Institutions and Systems (NIIS) and International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research vii programs, and my own fieldwork in the Chitwan District of Nepal, I find that some heterogeneity variables (such as, ethnic composition) are less likely than others to be an impediment to self-organization; the same heterogeneity variable (wealth disparity) may have opposite effects on different resource types; resource conditions are more likely to be affected by ability or inability of resource users to enforce rules rather than by their group differences; and that self-organized groups are able to mediate the perceived costs and benefits of organizing through institutional design.

abstract = {Residential irrigation efficiency is a long-term concern for any community that faces water supply stress. When ability to raise water prices is constrained, public education and conservation programs can produce reduced water usage. Understanding the factors behind residential irrigation efficiency allows the design of more effective conservation campaigns. Combining site-specific water budgets with usage data for four hundred homes in North Texas enables quantifying efficient irrigation behavior. A survey of homeowners tests for the presence of conservation-positive attitudes and the knowledge required to implement those attitudes. The influence of neighbors' watering habits is investigated using spatial clustering tools. Findings are analyzed in the context of an attitude, knowledge, and habit model of conservation behavior. The presence of automatic irrigation systems, small irrigated areas, and having knowledge of the amount that one waters one's lawn are found to contribute to more intensive irrigation. Mixed evidence for small-scale clustering in irrigation intensity is presented.},

abstract = {Background  Surgical site infection (SSI) describes an infectious complication of surgical wounds. Although SSI is thought to be preventable, it still represents a major cause of morbidity and substantial economic burden on the health system. Wound irrigation (WI) might reduce the level of bacterial contamination, but current data on its role in reducing or preventing SSI is conflicting. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of WI with normal saline prior to wound closure for the reduction of SSI in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from inception to present, and cross-checked the reference lists of all included primary studies and relevant systematic reviews. (Quasi-) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the rate of SSI when using normal saline vs. no irrigation prior to wound closure following abdominal surgery were included. Primary outcome was the rate of SSI, secondary outcome the mean length of hospital stay (LOS). Results Four RCTs including a total of 1194 patients were included for analysis. All studies compared wound irrigation with normal saline with no wound irrigation prior to wound closure. Their risk of bias was moderate. The relative risk of developing a SSI was lower when wound irrigation with normal saline was performed prior to wound closure although the effect was not statistically significant (risk ratio 0.73, 95{\%}-confidence level: 0.37 to 1.43). Similarly, there was no difference in the LOS amongst both intervention arms. Conclusion This systematic review could not identify an advantage for routine irrigation of abdominal wounds with normal saline over no irrigation prior to wound closure in preventing or reducing the rate of SSI.

abstract = {PURPOSETraditionally, during trabeculectomy, Mitomycin-C (MMC) is applied to the tissues using surgical sponges. However, alternate modes of application exist. This study assessed the success rates, complication rates, final intraocular pressure (IOP), and bleb characteristics between patients receiving subtenon MMC application by sponge versus irrigation.PATIENTS AND METHODSA total of 100 patients with glaucoma were enrolled and each was randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. Patients underwent trabeculectomy with Ex-PRESS shunt and MMC placement and were followed for 6 months. Complication rates assessed included bleb failure, bleb leaks, bleb encapsulation, and hypotony, amongst others. Additional factors evaluated included bleb morphology, glaucoma drop usage, Fluorouracil (5-FU) application, bleb revision, and subsequent glaucoma surgery.RESULTSThe irrigation method provided greater IOP lowering effects (P=0.03); correspondingly the irrigation group had higher rates of hypotony (P=0.03) but with no significant consequences. Patients who had trabeculectomy/Ex-PRESS alone had greater IOP reduction than those who had concurrent cataract surgery (P{\textless}0.001). The sponge group had higher rates of 5-FU use (P=0.007) and higher reoperation rates (P=0.02) when compared with the irrigation group. Success was defined as achieving 4 mm Hg≤IOP≤15 mm Hg without any anatomical bleb failure or subsequent glaucoma surgery. The overall success rate was 87{\%}.CONCLUSIONSApplication of subtenon MMC by irrigation seems to provide improved short-term outcomes compared with application with sponges. With a similar safety profile, the irrigation method provides better IOP control, and decreases the need for further clinical/surgical intervention in the short-term after trabeculectomy. Longer-term studies will be useful in analyzing if these differences persist with time.},

@phdthesis{Rap2004,
abstract = {This thesis studies the emergence, process and outcomes of the Mexican policy of Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT). Under the influence of neo-liberal government policies, the transfer of government-managed irrigation districts to water users' associations (WUAs) has radically changed irrigation management in Mexico during the past fifteen years. Internationally, Mexico's IMT programme has been heralded as a success and has drawn widespread attention because of its rapid implementation. Consequently, it has been propagated as a model for other countries seeking to improve the performance of their public irrigation systems and cut burgeoning public expenditures. This study firstly critically examines the emergence of this policy model and its proclaimed success. Secondly, it discusses the impacts this has on everyday irrigation management. The contribution of this thesis to the study of policy reform and irrigation management is that it consistently analyses them as political practices that are also expressive of the cultural dimension of human action and social ordering. The thesis is the product of intensive fieldwork carried out between 1997 and 1999. The first stage concerned a detailed organisation study of the WUA that is called the Left Bank of the River Santiago and is located on the Northern Coast of Nayarit in Western Mexico. The second stage of my research covered the entire life cycle of the IMT policy, from its earliest roots until its international celebration as a policy model. From the beginning, the ethnography of an organisation and the study of policy were basically mtertwined throughout my research journey, although the emphasis shifted towards the latter. On the one hand, the thesis offers a comprehensive analysis of the contemporary history of the IMT policy. It traces the idea of transfer back to its bureaucratic roots and reviews how the idea gained political commitment as the consequence of a prolonged bureaucratic struggle. This shows that the IMT policy has a fascinating history that it is tied up with the past and the future of the hydraulic bureaucracy (involved with hydraulic resources and water management). The formerly influential and autonomous Ministry of Water Resources lost its autonomy and its control over the irrigation districts in Mexico when it was merged halfway the 1970s with the agricultural bureaucracy (responsible for the agricultural sector). At the end of the 1980s, the IMT policy played an important role in the reconstitution of the hydraulic bureaucracy in the Comisi{\'{o}}n Nacional del Agua (CNA: National Water Commission), which regained autonomy and control over the irrigation districts.},

abstract = {Holospinal epidural abscess (HEA) is an extremely rare spinal infection involving the entire spine and is infrequently reported in the literature. Cases with evidence of spinal cord compression and consequent neurological deficit are typically managed with prompt surgical drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical intervention is often challenging because this condition is inherently associated with poor prognosis and serious complications, including death. During the surgical evacuation of the abscess, catheter-based irrigation must be adequately performed. In the majority of reported cases, the extent of the advancement of the epidural catheter is blindly assessed by the operating surgeon, increasing the risk of residual collections and subsequent persistent infection. Herein, we report a rare case of HEA that was successfully treated with surgical evacuation and skip laminectomies. We also describe a catheter-based technique that facilitates adequate irrigation, thereby ensuring the complete drainage of HEA in obscured perispinal areas, as well as the decompression of the spinal cord. Postoperative neurological examination exhibited marked improvement in motor function (compared with a baseline of complete quadriparesis), indicating the successful decompression of the spinal cord and neurological improvement.},

The objective of this study was to assess the sustainability and social acceptance of wastewater irrigation in the southeast Interlake region. It was concluded that sustainably irrigating forage crops would be challenging. The combination of soils with only ratings of fair for irrigability and the low quality of wastewater limits the long term sustainability of irrigation. Only one study site maintains a high potential to develop a wastewater irrigation program due to sufficient suitable land and appropriate wastewater quality. The social acceptance of wastewater irrigation is mixed with only about half the survey respondents favourable to irrigation or reuse of wastewater.},

abstract = {Summary
Lake Tutchewop in southeastern Australia is a former ephemeral wetland that has been used as a saline disposal basin since 1968, forming part of the salinity management of the Murray River. The extent of saline focused recharge from Lake Tutchewop and fresh recharge from nearby unlined irrigation channels was determined using pore water and groundwater stable isotope and major ion chemistry, which were able to separate the influence of lake water, irrigation water and regional groundwater. In ∼45years, saline water from Lake Tutchewop has infiltrated only up to 165m from the lake edge in most directions, due to the underlying relatively impermeable clay-rich sediments, and a maximum of 700m due to preferential groundwater flow along a sandy palaeochannel. The saline leakage has had limited, if any, impact on surrounding agricultural land use. Fresh water leakage from unlined irrigation channels extends up to 10m deep, validating the current program to replace these channels with pipelines. This study demonstrates that focused recharge from different sources can be positively identified where the recharge waters have distinctive compositions, and that underlying clay-rich sediments restrict the extent of seepage. Therefore, management of focused recharge sources, particularly those that could decrease groundwater quality, requires a detailed knowledge of both the groundwater composition around the site and the underlying geology.},

abstract = {Arid and semiarid regions with rain shortage and scarce good quality water must make use of low-quality water for irrigation. Consequently, improved plant cultivars for use in these areas should show adaptation capacities to confer drought and salt resistance and allow the cultivation under limited water availabiltiy. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of deficit irrigation with saline water on two local barley landraces, “Karkeni” and “Bengardeni”. Plants were saline-irrigated with three watering regimes during tillering, heading, and grain filling stages. Biochemical traits, carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$13C), mineral composition, grain yield (GY) and water use efficiency based on grain yield (WUEgy) were evaluated as performance indicators. Almost all of the studied traits (e.g. soluble carbohydrates, proline, ∆13C, Na concentration, and GY) were significantly affected by deficient saline-irrigation regimes at different growth stages. The hierarchical clustering analysis clearly showed that $\Delta$13C placed very close to GY averaging two barley landraces, which was in accordance with the scatter plot result. Multiple linear regression performed between GY as the dependent variable and other traits studied as the independent variables indicated that WUEgy, $\Delta$13C, and soluble carbohydrates significantly explained the variability in GY (R2=95.64{\%}). A signiﬁcant positive correlation that observed between ∆13C and GY at three growth stages, indicated that ∆13C may be an important proxy component for indirect selection of yield potential in barley under deficient irrigation regimes with saline water. According to our result, “Karkeni” seems to be more efﬁcient in terms of higher GY, WUEgy, proline and carbohydrate contents, K, Mg and Zn concentrations, as well as lower $\Delta$13C and lipid peroxidation as compared with “Bengardeni”, under low osmotic potential imposed by deficient irrigation treatments with saline water, “Karkeni” can thus be selected and used as a parent in order to obtain more tolerant plants against such stresses in future breeding programs.},

abstract = {This study develops a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of new methods to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices. The methodology consists of a comparative cost-benefit analysis based on the Value of Information approach that makes it possible to analyse whether an improvement in the information available to farmers generates economic benefits. The method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models (providing irrigation advice based on measurements, water balance models and weather predictions) and prevailing irrigation practices (at times based on soil and plant observations, or on advanced technologies) in estimating and predicting crop water requirements, in pilot experiments located in four different European regions. The results reveal that the introduction of the alternative method improves the performance of irrigation practices in Mediterranean regions that are characterised by high weather variability and for those crops for which the consequences of failing to meet predictions are relatively low (i.e. tomato instead of maize, drip irrigated crops instead of sprinkler irrigated crops). Under favourable conditions, the use of the alternative technology generates a 0–20{\%} increase in gross margin and a 10–30{\%} water saving with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices. The study concludes by addressing the conditions that justify the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation interventions and by offering some policy recommendations to drive their uptake. These include subsidising research at the evaluation stage and public investments aimed at knowledge creation (weather and shallow water table monitoring stations) and knowledge sharing (counselling) at the adoption stage.},

abstract = {The present study shows a methodology analysing the role plaid by information in conditioning the criteria used to schedule irrigation by farmers. The method is applied to the problem of comparing advanced instruments (advice services) and prevailing current practices (calendar irrigation) in valuing and predicting soil water content to schedule irrigation. Such assessment approach brought to the formulation of two main hypotheses: a) the message service is valuable if those messages with higher failure consequences are enough accurate to drive decisions; b) The use of information services to plan irrigation is favoured by the increasing frequencies of irrigation intervention because of the relatively lower expected consequences of failing to meet predictions. This methodology was applied to few pilot experiments. Observed impacts substantiate model hypothesis, revealing that the introduction of advanced information systems is favoured in sub-arid climate regions and for drip irrigated crops, where it was recorded a 0{\%} to 20{\%} increase in gross margin and a 10{\%} to 30{\%} water saving. The study concludes addressing the condition justifying the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation intervention and offering some policy recommendation to drive the development and the early adoption of such technologies .

abstract = {The swine production is a very important economic matter, occupying prominent position in the worldwide market. However, it appears as the greater impacting activity for the water resources. Researches point a swine manure production of 105.6 million m{\^{}}sup 3{\^{}}/year in Brazil, which resulted in a piggery wastewater rich in solids, nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens. Moreover, the water consumption for swine production is approximately 15 L/animal/day in southern Brazil, resulting in an unsustainable water resource demand. Thereby, this study verifies the viability of two parallel stabilization reservoirs as a technology for polishing treated piggery wastewater. This technology has been shown effective in reducing organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens in the treatment of the effluents with low or high organic load rate. The reservoirs can improve effluent quality with minimal energy costs to simple operations. The technique would promote the value of the effluent through its reuse for agricultural irrigation. The study was conducted at a farm in the city of Bra{\c{c}}o do Norte, Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil; this region has one of the largest densities of pigs in the world, which causes serious environmental problems.   The effluent monitoring program included operation during both cold seasons (period I) and warm seasons (period II). The performance of the reservoirs improved continuously during the cold seasons, with the removal efficiencies of total biochemical oxygen demand (BOD{\^{}}sub 5{\^{}}), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and Escherichia coli reaching 52{\%}, 64{\%}, and 99.9{\%}, respectively, with an effluent concentration of 144 mg{\textperiodcentered}L{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} for BOD{\^{}}sub 5{\^{}} and 256 mg{\textperiodcentered}L{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} for TKN. During the warm seasons, the BOD{\^{}}sub 5{\^{}}, TKN, and E. coli removal efficiencies increased to 85{\%}, 77{\%}, and 99.9{\%}, respectively, with an effluent concentration of 52 mg{\textperiodcentered}L{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}}for BOD{\^{}}sub 5{\^{}} and 136 mg{\textperiodcentered}L{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}} for TKN, which indicates that seasonal factors greatly influence the removal of these variables. E. coli concentrations were not verified into stabilization reservoirs on both periods.   The results of this study confirmed that the stabilization reservoirs are capable experimental units promoting improved quality of the treated effluent. A seasonal influence was evident. The results demonstrated that the effluent was a good alternative for unrestrained irrigation use. The microbiological quality complies with the World Health Organization recommendations. The reuse of this treated effluent can reduce pig manure impacts on the environment and water resources.},

abstract = {Many small-scale irrigation systems are characterized by low yields and deteriorating infrastructure. Interventions often erroneously focus on increasing yields and rehabilitating infrastructure. Small-scale irrigation systems have many of the characteristics of complex socio-ecological systems, with many different actors and numerous interconnected subsystems. However, the limited interaction between the different subsystems and their agents prevents learning and the emergence of more beneficial outcomes. This article reports on using Agricultural Innovation Platforms to create an environment in which irrigation scheme actors can engage, experiment, learn and build adaptive capacity to increase market-related offtake and move out of poverty.},

abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay estimates producers' willingness to grow switchgrass for biomass on marginal land or to lease it out for that purpose in the Midwest region of the United States using a contingent valuation method. The results show that potential producers in this region require relatively large payments to produce or lease out marginal lands for switchgrass production. The estimated means of willingness to accept to produce and to lease range from {\$}197 per acre to {\$}285 per acre which are well above the average 2013 Conservation Reserve Program rental rates ({\$}145 per acre) and the average 2014 net revenue potential producers expected from their marginal lands ({\$}166/acre).   The second essay estimates smallholder irrigation farmers' preferences for groundwater protection under the Vea irrigation scheme in Ghana using a double-bounded contingent valuation method (CVM) with two scenarios (environment and health). It estimates farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for fertilizer that protects groundwater quality, and also investigates impacts of information on WTP in a developing country setting. It finds that farmers who received the health scenario are willing to pay more than those who received the environmental scenario. The mean WTP from the health scenario subsample is about GHC 79 per acre, while that from the environmental scenario subsample is about GHC 57 per acre. The results also show that the household's primary water source significantly impacts WTP to protect groundwater.   The third essay estimates WTP of residents of the Bongo district in Ghana to protect groundwater from nitrate contamination using the double-bounded CVM. The survey questionnaire elicited WTP from two subsamples to test for conditional cooperation as a situation under which welfare can be maximized in the protection of groundwater by residents and farmers. The results show that residents are conditionally cooperative in their WTP responses, suggesting that the free-rider problem may not occur in the protection of groundwater in the area. The mean WTP from the conditional cooperation subsample is 68.60 pesewas and is higher than that of the mean WTP from the subsample without conditional cooperation which is 63.74 pesewas.},

@phdthesis{Lu2022,
abstract = {Both extensive (share of insured acres in total insurable acres) and intensive (coverage level choice) margin participation rates in the U.S. crop insurance program have increased due to generous subsidies. On a national scale, this program has been well rated to satisfy the actuarial fairness requirement by USDA Risk Management Agency. However, sizeable spatial heterogeneity remains across the Great Plains and Corn Belt regions. If subsidies were to be reduced in the future because of financial constraints, such heterogeneity might be detrimental to the sustainability of the crop insurance program. A central theme of this dissertation is to investigate how farmers make participation decisions when risk factors exist. In a separate but related line of work, this dissertation also explores the irrigation water usage in the Great Lakes region because farmers' irrigation behavior reflects their risk preferences and impacts their incentives for enrolling in the program. The dissertation consists of three essays on farmers' decisions regarding premium mispricing, basis risk, and irrigation water usage. The first essay proposes a novel resampling procedure to estimate farm-level actuarially fair premiums. The resampling procedure mainly contains two parts: (i) semi-parametric quantile regression; and (ii) rejection method. Many previous studies explore whether county-level mispricing exists based on the historical loss ratio records. However, we can identify farm-level mispricing by imputing actuarially fair premiums based on historical yield records, consistent with theory. We find that farmers with lower land quality cropland paid fewer premiums than they should, but a contrary case happens for farmers with higher land quality cropland. Empirical evidence shows farmers may be more concerned about mispricing than subsidy transfer. Regression results support a conclusion that such farm-level mispricing deters farmers' crop insurance demand. Our analysis sheds light on the policy-making that: (i) mispricing may be a substitution of subsidy so mitigating mispricing can maintain high participation while saving subsidies; and (ii) imputation of premiums based on historical yield records can apply.The second essay focuses on the impact of basis risk on participation rates in the U.S. crop insurance program. In recent years, basis risk has been increasingly recognized as an essential driver for deterring insurance uptake. Most research concentrates on index insurance contracts; however, few investigate the effect of mismatch between cash and futures markets on farmers' insurance decisions. We first build a conceptual model to show farmers' acreage response to basis risk within the expected utility framework. Next, we apply the Fractional Probit with Control Function for the empirical analysis and find that the effects of basis risk on participation rates are significantly negative for nearly all insurance contracts. Our analysis implies that: (i) to remove basis risk, revision for revenue contract may be considered; (ii) subsidy structure may be adjusted to be consistent with the underlying basis risk. The third essay investigates irrigation water usage in the Great Lakes region. Although the water conservation policy was implemented, there has been an upward trend in irrigation water demand from 2003 to 2018, including irrigated acres and total water usage. We employ firm-level irrigation data to examine what factors impact farmers' response to irrigation water usage. We find that: (i) price elasticities vary significantly according to model specifications and water costs; (ii) demand at both extensive (irrigated acres) and intensive (water application per acre) margins is input price inelastic; and (iii) price elasticities are homogeneous across crops but heterogeneous across states. For the policy-making, if there is a 10{\%} tax on irrigation water cost, total water usage decreases by about 4{\%} for corn and soybean, respectively.},

Beside of these issues another phenomenon dealing with climate change also is coming up and treating peoples in some respects. In the developing country such as Indonesia environmental load in term of increasing population rate occur tremendously. More peoples mean more resources have to be provided. However, some recourse is scares and others are not available every time. Better water resources management even this aspect was considered as critical one, but it was could be used as a tool to solve the problems properly. Increasing water users in the river basin would also create competition among of them. Recently about 80 {\%} of water use in the world goes to irrigation purposes and most of them are managed inefficient and less effective way. Changing of government policy and change of ecology may made irrigation water management getting worst. Irrigation management could not implement by using conventional method. A new approach to make irrigation management running better must be setting up. The Ministry of public works and Housing to represent Government of Republic of Indonesia launched irrigation modernization of Indonesia program in year of 2011. This paper aims to present concept and implementation progress of the Program.},

abstract = {The underperformance problem of large-scale irrigation systems particularly in developing countries, has adversely affected levels of production of those systems. The fact that these irrigation systems are not managed in response to their performance has been identified as the main reason behind their malfunctioning. A performance-oriented management approach is demonstrated here to help irrigation system managers take the right decisions, through continuous in-season performance assessment. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite images of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR) for the year 2000, complemented by water release data, were used to assess the performance of the Rahad irrigation scheme, Sudan (126 000 ha), on a 10-day time step. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (SEBAL) was used to process the NOAA-AVHRR images. The decisions on irrigation water allocation are guided by maps of the relative water supply and soil moisture content generated for the last time step. Further decision support could be realized using the performance indicators of the system and the soil water balance for the given time step. A semiautomatic computer program was developed which can be easily used by field staff to support their management decisions. It is anticipated that the application of such an approach will improve the performance of large-scale irrigation systems, and support development of a performance-oriented management culture among the staff of these irrigation systems.},

abstract = {Consumption of green vegetable products is commonly viewed as a potential risk factor for infection with enteric viruses. The link between vegetable crops and fecally contaminated irrigation water establishes an environmental scenario that can result in a risk to human health. The aim of this work was to analyze the enteric viral quality in leafy green vegetables from C{\'{o}}rdoba (Argentina) and its potential association with viral contamination of irrigation waters. During July-December 2012, vegetables were collected from peri-urban green farms (n = 19) and its corresponding urban river irrigation waters (n = 12). Also, urban sewage samples (n = 6) were collected to analyze the viral variants circulating in the community. Viruses were eluted and concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and then were subject to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction to assess the genome presence of norovirus, rotavirus and human astrovirus. The concentrates were also inoculated in HEp-2 (Human Epidermoid carcinoma strain {\#}2) cells to monitor the occurrence of infective enterovirus. The frequency of detection of the viral groups in sewage, irrigation water and crops was: norovirus 100{\%}, 67{\%} and 58{\%}, rotavirus 100{\%}, 75{\%} and 5{\%}, astrovirus 83{\%}, 75{\%} and 32{\%} and infective enterovirus 50{\%}, 33{\%} and 79{\%}, respectively. A similar profile in sewage, irrigation water and green vegetables was observed for norovirus genogroups (I and II) distribution as well as for rotavirus and astrovirus G-types. These results provide the first data for Argentina pointing out that green leafy vegetables are contaminated with a broad range of enteric viruses and that the irrigation water would be a source of contamination. The presence of viral genomes and infective particles in food that in general suffer minimal treatment before consumption underlines that green crops can act as potential sources of enteric virus transmission. Public intervention in the use of the river waters as irrigation source is needed.},

abstract = {Traditional water distribution and irrigation systems have been used in the Middle East in agriculture for thousands of years. The main objectives of the study are to investigate positive and negative environmental and social impacts of such traditional methods in three countries of the Mediterranean (Sudan, Yemen, and Palestine). To achieve these objectives, field visits, observations, interviews, and questionnaires were used. The results showed the presence of five main traditional water distribution systems in the three areas. Differences in the existing systems were attributed to farmers' education level, experience, and degree of water scarcity in the area (50{\%} of the educated farmers, more experienced farmers and water scarcity areas are adopting modern irrigation techniques, especially in Palestine). Preserving existing natural habitat and strengthening of social ties and relations between farmers were among the positive environmental impacts of such old methods. Water losses through high evaporation (about 40{\%} water loss), seepage and water pollution were among the negative impacts. Proper planning and control, especially by public institutions, and programs for environmental awareness are some necessary actions to minimize the negative impacts in such traditional water societies. Such suggested measures are specifically important to be adopted whenever modern methods of water distribution (pipelines) and irrigation (drip irrigation) are intended to be applied.},

abstract = {Expanding arable land under irrigation is cardinal in the quest to attain Africa's aspiration of transforming agriculture and realizing its true value and positive impact on wealth creation, economic growth, food security and nutrition for all. Over the last three to four decades, many initiatives have been designed to harness both small‐ and large‐scale irrigation technologies towards increasing agricultural production and productivity. The EAU4Food (European Union and African Union cooperative research to increase food production in irrigated farming systems in Africa) project was a collaborative project under the EU–African Union Scientific Partnership aimed at enabling the successful adoption and upscaling of appropriate irrigation support innovations. The project applied a transdisciplinary approach to design, test and disseminate innovations across the continent. The project was designed to gain better insights vis‐{\`{a}}‐vis how the innovation process can be enhanced, and to share insights for supporting the implementation of national agricultural development programmes and strategies conceived within the context of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) framework. This note highlights linkages between the CAADP framework and the EAU4Food project and suggests some future areas of attention on Africa's agenda for enhanced agricultural production, facilitated under the auspices of CAADP. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}L'expansion des terres arables irrigu{\'{e}}es est essentielle pour concr{\'{e}}tiser l'aspiration de l'Afrique {\`{a}} transformer l'agriculture et {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}aliser sa v{\'{e}}ritable valeur et son impact positif sur la cr{\'{e}}ation de richesses, la croissance {\'{e}}conomique, la s{\'{e}}curit{\'{e}} alimentaire et la nutrition pour tous.

abstract = {In variable interval irrigation, simply including soil salinity data in the soil salinity model is not valid for making predictions, because changes in irrigation frequency must also be taken into account. This study on variable interval irrigation used capacitance soil sensors simultaneously to obtain hourly measurements of bulk electrical conductivity ($\sigma$b), soil temperature (t) and soil water content ($\theta$). Observations of $\sigma$b were converted so that the electrical conductivity of the pore water ($\sigma$p) could be estimated as an indicator of soil salinity. Values of $\theta$, t and $\sigma$p were used to test a mathematical model for studying how $\sigma$p cross‐correlates with t and $\theta$ to predict soil salinity at a given depth. These predictions were based on measurements of $\sigma$p, t, and $\theta$ at a shallow depth. As a result, prediction at shallow depth was successful after integrating intervention analysis and outlier detection into the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We then used the (multiple‐input/one‐output) transfer function models to logically predict soil salinity at the depths of interest. The model could also correctly determine the effect of the irrigation event on soil salinity.

abstract = {Treadle pump (TP) technology has been promoted by Enterprise Works Worldwide (EWW) in West Africa as an alternative to the traditional rope and bucket irrigation that is necessary to overcome the challenge of uncertain and inadequate rainfall for agricultural production. The aim is to improve output, increase incomes and reduce poverty among rural farm households. This study examines the strategies used for dissemination of the TP and the dynamics of its adoption and impacts, with a special focus on poverty reduction. The data source for the study is a primary survey involving interviews with adopters and non-adopters of TP in the Volta and Ashanti regions of Ghana. The results of the study reveal that time and labor savings for irrigation, increased size of irrigated areas and lack of fuel requirements are the attractive features of the TP for those who adopt it. Almost all the TP adopters in the research sample were men. About 26 percent of the adopters achieved an increase in irrigated area; all saved time spent on irrigation and increased net farm income. The productivity of land and labor increased, while the welfare of adopters improved. The study demonstrates that adoption of TP reduces poverty. A positive impact on human capital was realized as incomes were used to pay for children's schooling and for health care. Some farmers, however, stopped the use of the TP, mostly because it broke down and could not be used over large extents of land. Also, about 10 percent of the adopters were able to shift to motorized pumping. It is recommended that a variety of improvements in design, dissemination and capacity might improve the impact of TP technology in West Africa. Increased collaboration with local institutions such as extension services could make the TP reach the farmers better. In this regard, a long-term program would be more effective than short-term projects. Design improvements should be undertaken to ease pedaling so as to encourage the uptake of the TP by women and enhance their chance of benefiting directly from it. The introduction of after-sales service and training of farmers on minor repairs will improve the continuous use and sustainability of the TP.},

@article{Hashem2021,
abstract = {As the most important resource for life, water has been a central issue on the international agenda for several decades. Yet, the world's supply of clean freshwater is steadily decreasing due to extensive agricultural demand for irrigated lands. Therefore, water resources should be used with greater efficiency, and the use of non-traditional water resources, such as Treated Wastewater (TW), should be increased. Reusing TW could be an alternative option to increase water resources. Thus, many countries have decided to turn wastewater into an irrigation resource to help meet urban demand and address water shortages. However, because of the nature of that water, there are potential problems associated with its use in irrigation. Some of the major concerns are health hazards, salinity build-up, and toxicity hazards. The objectives of this comprehensive literature review are to illuminate the importance of using TW in irrigation as an alternative freshwater source and to assess the effects of its use on soil fertility and other soil properties, plants, and public health. The literature review reveals that TW reuse has become part of the extension program for boosting water resource utilization. However, the uncontrolled application of such waters has many unfavorable effects on both soils and plants, especially in the long-term. To reduce these unfavorable effects when using TW in irrigation, proper guidelines for wastewater reuse and management should be followed to limit negative effects significantly.},

The framework of systems analysis is used to analyse how concepts of modern irrigation are construed. Specific attention is given to how (operational) management issues are integrated in the designed concepts of modern "productive" irrigation, and how the different conceptions on management and 'modernity' by designers, operation agencies and water users shape the post-implementation outcomes. To gain understanding of how the practices, conceptions and strategies of water management of water users and operation agencies have been shaped by past experiences and developments, an historical analysis is made of the establishment of the Indus basin and its "protective" irrigation systems, and its development up to the modernisation programme. The modernisation projects reviewed cover the different phases of design and construction, performance evaluation, and impact assessment. It is argued that the imposition of technical design concepts through externalised interventions hampers the process of change management. Finally, the institutional reform process started with the National Drainage Project is briefly reviewed as a new approach for handling the water management issues governing the Indus basin.},

These models typically estimate organically bound tritium (OBT) for calculating public dose as OBT itself is rarely measured. Higher than expected OBT/HTO ratios in plants and soils are an emerging issue that is not well understood. To support the improvement of models, an experimental garden was set up in 2012 at a tritium processing facility in Pembroke, Ontario to characterize the circumstances under which high OBT/HTO ratios may arise. Soils and plants were sampled weekly to coincide with detailed air and stack monitoring. The design included a plot of native grass/soil, contrasted with sod and vegetables grown in barrels with commercial topsoil under natural rain and either low or high tritium irrigation water. Air monitoring indicated that the plume was present infrequently at concentrations of up to about 100 Bq/m3 (the garden was not in a major wind sector). Mean air concentrations during the day on workdays (HTO 10.3 Bq/m3, HT 5.8 Bq/m3) were higher than at other times (0.7–2.6 Bq/m3). Mean Tissue Free Water Tritium (TFWT) in plants and soils and OBT/HTO ratios were only very weakly or not at all correlated with releases on a weekly basis. TFWT was equal in soils and plants and in above and below ground parts of vegetables. OBT/HTO ratios in above ground parts of vegetables were above one when the main source of tritium was from high tritium irrigation water (1.5–1.8). Ratios were below one in below ground parts of vegetables when irrigated with high tritium water (0.4–0.6) and above one in vegetables rain-fed or irrigated with low tritium water (1.3–2.8). In contrast, OBT/HTO ratios were very high (9.0–13.5) when the source of tritium was mainly from the atmosphere. TFWT varied considerably through time as a result of SRBT's operations; OBT/HTO ratios showed no clear temporal pattern in above or below ground plant parts. Native soil after ∼20 years of operations at SRBT had high initial OBT that persisted through the growing season; little OBT formed in garden plot soil during experiments. High OBT in native soil appeared to be a signature of higher past releases at SRBT. This phenomenon was confirmed in soils obtained at another processing facility in Canada with a similar history. The insights into variation in OBT/HTO ratios found here are of regulatory interest and should be incorporated in assessment models to aid in the design of relevant environmental monitoring programs for OBT.},

abstract = {In the first article, we surveyed turfgrass sod producers to determine their preferences for different sod cultivars contingent on certain traits and their price. Turfgrass breeders have developed turfgrass cultivars exhibiting traits for improved long term maintenance, appearance, utility, and resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors. As universities seek to capture revenue to cover research costs, these cultivars are typically protected by intellectual property rights. Holders of these rights generally require producers to be licensed to produce and sell proprietary cultivars, as well as pay royalties, impacting the marketability of cultivars available for sale. An online turfgrass preference survey with sod producers using a discrete choice experiment was conducted in Spring 2015. The design incorporated attributes such as cultivar, certification agency, fee structure, maintenance reduction potential, and price per square foot. Results from the analysis indicated that producers preferred genetically modified breeds and fee structures that allow producers to share the market uncertainty with the breed developers.  In the second article, we dealt with understanding outdoor irrigation water conservation in the commercial sector. Periodic drought stress in Oklahoma has forced utilities departments, including Oklahoma City, to seek ways of conserving water in both the residential and non-residential sectors. Most of these efforts largely targeted the residential sector. In this study, we identified the willingness of commercial businesses in the Oklahoma City metro area to participate in water conservation methods such as installing soil moisture sensors, smart irrigation controllers for their businesses and participating in voluntary irrigation assessments. We conducted a mail survey of 2784 Oklahoma City Water Utilities' commercial customers in which we used data from contingent valuation questions to elicit the financial savings on water that would encourage participation in a landscape irrigation assessment or adoption of smart irrigation controllers. A sub sample experimental group received detailed information about future block rate water price increases. The results of the study indicated that, at current water utilities price rates commercial businesses are unlikely to adopt these programs, but that including information about future price rate hikes may induce a subset of businesses to participate.},

abstract = {Irrigation water has been highlighted as a source of microbial contamination in produce. Water treatment has been recommended as an intervention strategy to reduce microbial risks associated to irrigation water. Commercial water treatments mostly depend on chemical agents; although growers search for greener alternatives to chemical biocides. Ultrasounds (US) have been proposed as an environmentally friendly technology for irrigation water. In the present study, the suitability of two US treatments (20kHz: US20 and 40kHz: US40 at a specific energy (Es) of 745J/L) and one chlorine treatment (1–2ppm free chlorine) was evaluated and compared to the untreated control. Five water reservoirs belonging to five commercial intensive farms were selected as representative of irrigation practices generally used in south of Europe. All tested water treatments were able to reduce microbial loads, including Escherichia coli (0.5–0.6 log units), to values that were accepted in most of the recommended guidelines of good agricultural practices (≤2logunits). The obtained reductions were lower than those previously reported for these water treatment technologies in lab-scale tests. High microbial reductions are commonly obtained in laboratory studies, yielding impressive results. However, when the same treatments are applied under real commercial conditions, microbial reductions are usually less impressive. All water treatments were able to reduce COD of irrigation water when compared to the untreated control. COD reductions obtained using chlorine (≥430mg/L) and US 20 ({\~{}}100mg/L) were higher than those observed using US 40 ({\textless}50mg/L). The impact of the water quality on the efficacy of US treatments was evaluated in two types of water including surface water and treated wastewater. It was found that the quality of the irrigation water significantly influences the efficacy of the ultrasound treatment. Correlations between indicator parameters have been also evaluated. Obtained results showed that high algae counts were well correlated with high levels of coliforms and E. coli. It could be concluded that US can be proposed as an alternative water treatment to chemical treatments to preserve microbial quality of irrigation water stored in water reservoirs reducing the environmental impact.},

abstract = {Objectives: We performed a systematic review of current evidence regarding ultrasound-guided percutaneous irrigation of calcific tendinopathy (US-PICT) in the shoulder aimed to: assess different published techniques; evaluate clinical outcome in a large combined cohort; and propose suggestions for homogeneous future reporting. Methods: Cochrane Collaboration for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Guidelines were followed. We searched MEDLINE/MEDLINE In-Process/EMBASE/Cochrane databases from 1992-2013 using the keywords 'ultrasound, shoulder, needling, calcification, lavage, rotator cuff' combined in appropriate algorithms. References of resulting papers were also screened. Risk of bias was assessed with a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Of 284 papers found, 15 were included, treating 1,450 shoulders in 1,403 patients (females, n=838; mean age interval 40-63 years). There was no exclusion due to risk of bias. Conclusions: US-PICT of rotator cuff is a safe and effective procedure, with an estimated average 55 {\%} pain improvement at an average of 11 months, with a 10 {\%} minor complication rate. No evidence exists in favour of using a specific size/number of needles. Imaging follow-up should not be used routinely. Future studies should aim at structural uniformity, including the use of the Constant Score to assess outcomes and 1-year minimum follow-up. Alternatives to steroid injections should also be explored. Key Points : times US-PICT of rotator cuff is a safe and effective procedure. times On average 55{\%} pain improvement with 10{\%} minor complication rate. times No evidence exists in favour of using a specific size/number of needles. times Future need to assess outcome using Constant Score with 1-year minimum follow-up.},

abstract = {Underground taming of floods for irrigation (UTFI) is a new approach for mitigating flood impacts through targeted floodwater storage in depleted aquifers for irrigating crops in the dry season. UTFI not only fosters the much-desired conjunctive use and management of water resources but also provides the environmental services that are of high socioeconomic value. UTFI interventions are individually established at the local scale (e.g. village pond, check dam) but to achieve more substantial positive benefits at the scale of meso watersheds (10 s of km2) or sub-basins (100-1,000 s of km2) in the flood-prone river basins requires area-based implementation. Given the nature and scale required, UTFI needs to be managed at the community level with the help of appropriate institutional arrangements taking into account both the upstream and downstream locations. This paper reviews the existing institutional approaches and proposes an institutional framework that can help to mainstream UTFI management in the context of South Asia. The proposed model is centred on the existing formal institutions and also integrates non-market (participatory) and market (payments for environmental services) instruments that can provide win-win strategies for water resource management to downstream and upstream communities.},

However, outcomes of investments are insufficiently understood, limiting the future design of interventions. This article applies a fixed effects regression model to test whether modernization of irrigation systems in Madhya Pradesh leads to improvements in district-level yields and protection of yields against sub-basin rainfall variability. Findings suggest that investments fail to improve yields in districts with deficient rainfall and fail to buffer crops against monsoon variability, compared to control districts with no investments. Interventions should be designed to respond to the complexities of sub-basin rainfall variability.},

abstract = {Irrigation, the dominant use of water resources, has always remained a decisive factor in agricultural growth and development. The present study provides a critical analysis of inter-regional variations in water resources and irrigation development over successive plan periods (1950-2007) and ascertains the long-term impact of irrigation development on Indian agriculture using tabular, growth and econometric analysis. With impressive irrigation development over successive five-year plans, India possesses the largest irrigated area in the world. However, the positive impact of irrigation development could not be achieved equally across different geographical regions, and unsustainable water resource development in one part coexists with its underutilization in other parts of the country. The Northern region of India showed better performance both in irrigation and agriculture while the Eastern region was found to be poorest in spite of a rich water resource base. Panel data analysis revealed a positive correlation between irrigation and crop yield though with varying degree. The findings of the present study provides a platform for institutional restructuring, policy reframing and technological interventions to improve water use efficiency and develop water resources in a equitable, holistic and sustainable manner.

La presente etude fournit une analyse critique des variations interregionales des ressources en eau au cours des plans de developpement successifs (1950-2007), et determine l'impact a long terme du developpement de l'irrigation sur l'agriculture indienne a l'aide de tableaux de croissance et d'analyse econometrique. Les plans quinquennaux successifs ont fait que l'Inde possede la plus grande superficie irriguee dans le monde. Toutefois, l'impact positif du developpement de l'irrigation ne pourrait pas etre atteint si certaines regions geographiques developpaient les ressources en eau de facon non durable, alors que d'autres regions coexisteraient avec des ressources sous-utilisees. La region du Nord de l'Inde a montre de meilleures performances a la fois en termes d'irrigation et d'agriculture tandis que la region de l'Est est parmi les plus pauvres en depit de ressources en eau abondantes. L'analyse des donnees du panel a revele une correlation positive entre l'irrigation et le rendement des cultures, mais avec des degres divers. La presente etude resulte en une plateforme pour la restructuration institutionnelle et le recadrage des politiques ainsi que des interventions technologiques pour ameliorer l'efficacite d'utilisation de l'eau et developper les ressources en eau de maniere equitable, globale et durable.

abstract = {In large‐scale irrigation schemes built in flood plains the state of the drainage systems not only affects the performance of irrigation but also the quality of life of the population. However, maintenance of the drainage infrastructure is often neglected. This paper draws from two transdisciplinary interventions dealing with the maintenance of drainage infrastructure in the Chokwe Irrigation Scheme in Mozambique: one tested an experimental intervention that called on farmers and experts to solve local drainage issues. The other used a participatory mapping, modelling and simulation approach to discuss the barriers to upscaling different solutions at scheme levels. Managerial issues such as a good communication between actors, a good match between tasks and resources, and the scheduling of maintenance activities were important, but the most difficult challenge was addressing the underlying economic, social and political drivers that affected the relationships between actors and consequently their willingness to cooperate. Thus, the development of perennial solutions calls for (re)internalization of the social and political dimensions in scheme management and to rethink the issue of equity not as a moral injunction but as a condition for irrigation success. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Alternate abstract:R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}Dans les syst{\`{e}}mes d'irrigation {\`{a}} grande {\'{e}}chelle construits dans les plaines inondables, l'{\'{e}}tat des syst{\`{e}}mes de drainage affecte non seulement la performance de l'irrigation mais aussi la qualit{\'{e}} de vie de la population.

abstract = {The landscape of water in Utah is changing due to population growth, conversion of agricultural land to urban development, and increasing awareness of water scarcity. The Utah Division of Water Resources forecasts that the currently developed water supplies will not be enough to provide for Utah's future population, and is pursuing conservation and new development to meet the state's anticipated needs.    Along with the urban growth Utah is experiencing a growing urban and small farm agricultural sector, but knowledge of water use in these operations is limited. Further research in this area aids in understanding the impact of land use change on the state's hydrology, aids the state water authorities in water use estimates, assists farmers in moving towards wiser water management, and helps Utah State University Extension better meet the needs of small irrigators.    My research creates a clearer picture of urban and small farm agricultural irrigation in Utah. For the 2015 growing season I performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in Cache Valley, and I explore the results from both case study and statistical perspectives. My results show a great degree of heterogeneity with irrigation efficiencies ranging from 6{\%} to 100{\%}. In general, small fields had greater irrigation depths than large fields, and surface irrigated fields applied higher depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields. Yet a big influence on efficiency was management, as fields relying on a set schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors. Therefore, water conservation programs focused on reducing irrigated area or providing technological alternatives may not result in true water savings if the effect of management is ignored. In particular, urban and small farmers need increased awareness of how management can result in savings of time and money, and improved knowledge of how to measure application rates, improve application uniformity, and scheduling techniques. With improvements in these areas, water management on urban and small farms can be improved, therein helping the urban and small farm irrigators themselves as well as the state in meeting its future water needs.},

abstract = {Water from wastewater-polluted streams and dug-outs is the most commonly used water source for irrigation in urban farming in Ghana, but helminth parasite eggs in the water represent health risks when used for crop production. Conventional water treatment is expensive, requires advanced technology and often breaks down in less developed countries so low cost interventions are needed. Field and laboratory based trials were carried out in order to investigate the effect of the natural coagulant Moringa oleifera (MO) seed extracts in reducing helminh eggs and turbidity in irrigation water, turbid water, wastewater and tap water. In medium to high turbid water MO extracts were effective in reducing the number of helminth eggs by 94–99.5{\%} to 1–2 eggs per litre and the turbidity to 7–11 NTU which is an 85–96{\%} reduction. MO is readily available in many tropical countries and can be used by farmers to treat high turbid water for irrigation, however, additional improvements of water quality, e.g. by sand filtration, is suggested to meet the guideline value of ≤1 helminth egg per litre and a turbidity of ≤2 NTU as recommended by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for water intended for irrigation. A positive correlation was established between reduction in turbidity and helminth eggs in irrigation water, turbid water and wastewater treated with MO. This indicates that helminth eggs attach to suspended particles and/or flocs facilitated by MO in the water, and that turbidity and helminth eggs are reduced with the settling flocs. However, more experiments with water samples containing naturally occurring helminth eggs are needed to establish whether turbidity can be used as a proxy for helminth eggs.},

abstract = {Background: Soil salinity is a critical environmental problem in many countries around the world especially the arid and semi-arid countries like South Africa. The problem has great impact on soil fertility which in turns has a great effect on soil productivity. This paper addresses the use of remote sensing and GIS in the assessment of salinity using Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) data of the Vaal-Harts irrigation scheme acquired with other field data sets and a topographical map to show the spectral classes and salt-affected areas for the years under assessment (1991 to 2005). Results: The results of the study indicated that salinity problem exists and may get worse. The supervised classification maps show that most of the salinity problems are located along the entire scheme. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) tends to be higher along the irrigation canals. A plot of NDVI values and temperature trend give a correlation of 67{\%} this is an indication that temperature is a major factor in the build up of salinity in the study area. The low salinity class increased by 4, 8618 km super(2), while medium and high salinity classes decreased by 4,296.4 km super(2) and 485.4 km super(2), showing an increase in the salinity trend over the years. Conclusions: Considering the trend of salinity development in VHS, there is an urgent need for management program to be established in order to control the spread of the menace and therefore reclaim the damaged land in order to make the scheme more viable.},

abstract = {This study uses the 2016 Irrigation Survey from Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to document the use of irrigation best management practices (IBMPs), analyze use patterns, and use quantitative methods to determine factors that influence producers' decisions regarding IBMPs. IBMPs included in the survey can be grouped as: field management practices (zero-grade leveling, precision-grade leveling, end blocking, warped surface, and deep tillage), water flow control practices (computerized pipe-hole selection, multiple-inlet irrigation, surge irrigation, alternate wetting and drying, cutback irrigation, flow meters, and pump timers), water recovery/storage practices (tail-water recovery system and on-farm storage reservoir), and advanced irrigation scheduling practices (soil moisture sensors, ET or atmometers, computerized scheduling, and Woodruff charts). We find that most of the sample producers use between one and four individual IBMPs from two or more groups. Explanatory variables consist of producer characteristics (being a landowner, education, years of farming experience, income), farm characteristics (total irrigated acres, percent of irrigated acres under gravity irrigation, percent of irrigation from ground water, farm location), and conservation variables (participation in conservation programs within the last five years), and producer perception of groundwater shortage on his or her own farm. Important findings from our study include the strong correlation between higher irrigated acres and water flow meters, and the use of many IBMPs. Our results indicate that more years of farming experience is negatively associated with use of advanced irrigation scheduling practices, and participation in conservation programs such as EQIP is associated with use of water recovery and storage practices, as well as land leveling practices. Being located in a critical groundwater area did not have any statistically significant effect on producers' decisions concerning IBMPs in this study.},

abstract = {Uniformity of irrigation water and proper concentrations of nutrients, for major vegetable crops (cantaloupe and green beans) are critical problems under different climatic regions in Egypt especially newly reclaimed area. Uneven field surface, deep percolation, soil profile heterogeneity, and other soil problems characterize the situation of large area in the desert. These conditions affect water and nutrients distribution. The above mentioned agro management practices requires real time weather data system to be linked with soil, water and plant tissue analysis. The Central Laboratory for Agricultural Climate (CLAC) has established a system that utilizes agrometeorological data to calculate water requirements of vegetable crops based on climatic data as well as, soil and water analysis. Computer modeling is used to predict and calculate fertilizer requirements as well as fertilizer use efficiency. The integrated program provides a comprehensive tool for vegetable management that is window-based friendly tools. It also contains modules for further information on the crop accompanied with high-resolution photographs. The paper describes the models and tools used in the program. It illustrates the process of information and discuss the results of the field experimental work for the validation of the program.},

abstract = {Today's complex issues require technical expertise as well as the application of innovative social science techniques within Extension contexts. Researchers have suggested that a social science approach will play a critical role in water conservation, and people who use home landscape irrigation comprise a critical target audience for agriculture and natural resources professionals. This study was conducted to examine the possible role of an audience segmentation approach in addressing the complex issue of water resources. This research used descriptive discriminant analysis to assign national irrigation users to previously identified subgroups found in the literature (the water considerate majority, the water savvy conservationists, and the unconcerned water users) and compare characteristics to identify differences on a national scale. Results revealed the nation's irrigation users are fairly water conscious. The findings implied unique subgroups exist among targeted Extension audiences relevant to specific behaviors, and Extension programs should focus on different programmatic objectives for targeting different subgroups. Differences were found among the three subgroups in water conservation behaviors, personal and social normative beliefs, use of landscape professionals for irrigation maintenance, and learning preferences. Recommendations were provided on how to use the results to develop impact-driven Extension programs.},

abstract = {The plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar, is a major pest of stone and pome fruit (e.g., apples, pears, peaches, cherries, etc.). Entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema spp. and Heterorhabditis spp.) are virulent to ground-dwelling stages of C. nenuphar and may be incorporated into an integrated management strategy. Two significant questions that must be addressed prior to implementation are: (1) which nematode is most effective in suppressing the target pest under field conditions? and (2) what is the impact of various irrigation levels on field efficacy? We addressed these questions by comparing the efficacy of two nematodes, Steinernema riobrave and Steinernema feltiae (two nematodes that showed the highest virulence in prior lab assays and field trials) and an untreated control, at three irrigation levels 0, 1 and 6 irrigation events applied during a two-week period post-application. C. nenuphar larvae were added to mini-plots prior to treatment application. Treatment effects were assessed by comparing the number of C. nenuphar adults emerging from each plot. The experiments were conducted at two field sites (apple orchards in Kearneysville, West Virginia and Belchertown, Massachusetts) in 2011 and 2012. Relative to the untreated check, S. riobrave caused 85.0{\%} and 97.3{\%} control in 2011 and 2012 in Massachusetts (respectively) and 100{\%} control in West Virginia both years, whereas S. feltiae caused 0{\%} and 84.6{\%} control in 2011 and 2012 (respectively) in Massachusetts, and 78.2{\%} and 69.7{\%} control in West Virginia. The level of C. nenuphar suppression caused by S. riobrave was higher than suppression by S. feltiae at both sites in 2011 (no differences were detected in 2012). Irrigation did not have a significant effect on C. nenuphar suppression at both sites and in both years of the experiments. The lack of irrigation effects is an unusual finding for field applications using entomopathogenic nematodes, and may have been due to the level of precipitation and water-holding capacity in the field soils tested. The results of this study have positive implications for the potential of incorporating entomopathogenic nematodes into a C. nenuphar management program.},

abstract = {Game theory analysis of farm-level decisions regarding crop production, water management, and investments in irrigation systems may be helpful to public officials considering policies to motivate improvements in the use of irrigation and drainage resources. We describe several small game theory models to demonstrate the potential usefulness of this approach. In particular, we examine the impact of drainage system interactions and government policies that modify crop prices on farm-level decisions regarding rice and cotton production in the Nile River Delta. We also examine likely responses by upslope and downslope farmers to policies intended to reduce drainage water volume. Results suggest that the effectiveness of policies designed to improve irrigation and drainage management may be enhanced by considering farm-level incentives in a game theory framework. We also present a district-level model of the decision to participate actively in a regional program to reduce drainage water volume. Any one district has an incentive not to participate, and the payoff to non-participation increases with the degree of cooperation achieved among other districts.},

abstract = {The Cu Chi irrigation system in Vietnam forms part of the Dau Tieng reservoir system in the Dong Nai basin. Water competition in this system is intensifying as a result of increasing urban and environmental demand. System operation modelling using the Irrigation Main System OPeration (IMSOP) model was applied to the Cu Chi irrigation system, Vietnam, to improve its operational performance. The operation improvement process involved the comparison of supply and demand during two years, 2001 and 2002, revealing that the system's operation was carried out without consideration of the crop water demand and proper canal regulation. The retrospective operational analysis revealed a substantial amount of oversupply and inequity of distribution. Two new operation strategies were selected after a simulation analysis and evaluated in the field. The new scenarios showed a more equitable distribution of water in the system. The average pre-intervention supply-demand ratio which ranged from 1.68 to 2.51 was reduced to 1.20 for continuous flow and 1.17 for rotational operation. A comprehensive analysis of water reallocation to Ho Chi Minh City for urban and industrial purposes and its effect on the security of supply on the Cu Chi system was also undertaken.Original Abstract: Le systeme d'irrigation de Cu Chi au Viet-nam fait partie du systeme de reservoirs de Dau Tieng dans le bassin de Dong Nai. la competition pour l'eau dans ce systeme s'intensifie en raison de demandes urbaines et environnementales en hausse. la modelisation de ce systeme avec le modele Irrigation Main System OPeration (IMSOP) a ete realisee afin d'ameliorer ses performances operationnelles. le processus d'amelioration a pris en compte la comparaison de l'offre et de la demande de deux annees, 2001 et 2002, et revele que le controle du systeme a ete effectue sans consideration pour la demande en eau des cultures et sans regulation appropriee des canaux.

Deux nouvelles strategies operationnelles, selectionnees apres l'analyse de nombreuses simulations et une consultation avec les agriculteurs, ont ete evaluees sur le terrain. Ces strategies permettent une distribution plus equitable de l'eau dans le systeme. le ratio moyen de l'offre par rapport a la demande qui variait entre 1.68 et 2.51 a ete reduit a 1.20 pour un flux continu et a 1.17 pour une operation en rotation.

abstract = {The growing scarcity and competition for water resources requires the urgent implementation of measures to ensure their rational use. Farmers need affordable irrigation tools that allow them to take advantage of scientific know-how to improve water use efficiency in their common irrigation practices. The aim of this study is to test under field conditions, and adjust where required, an automated irrigation system that allows the establishment of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies in a stone fruit orchard. For this, an automated device with an algorithm which combines water-balance-based irrigation scheduling with a feedback adjustment mechanism using 15 capacitive sensors for continuous soil moisture measurement was used. The tests were carried out in 2016 and 2017 in Vegas Bajas del Guadiana (Extremadura, Spain) on an experimental plot of ‘Red Beaut', an early-maturing Japanese plum cultivar. Three irrigation treatments were established: control, RDI and automatic. The control treatment was scheduled to cover crop water needs, a postharvest deficit irrigation (40{\%} crop evapotranspiration (ETc)) strategy was applied in the RDI treatment, while the Automatic treatment simulated the RDI but without human intervention. After two years of testing, the automated system was able to “simulate” the irrigation scheduling programmed by a human expert without the need for human intervention.},

abstract = {The growing scarcity and competition for water resources requires the urgent implementation of measures to ensure their rational use. Farmers need affordable irrigation tools that allow them to take advantage of scientific know-how to improve water use efficiency in their common irrigation practices. The aim of this study is to test under field conditions, and adjust where required, an automated irrigation system that allows the establishment of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies in a stone fruit orchard. For this, an automated device with an algorithm which combines water-balance-based irrigation scheduling with a feedback adjustment mechanism using 15 capacitive sensors for continuous soil moisture measurement was used. The tests were carried out in 2016 and 2017 in Vegas Bajas del Guadiana (Extremadura, Spain) on an experimental plot of ‘Red Beaut', an early-maturing Japanese plum cultivar. Three irrigation treatments were established: control, RDI and automatic. The control treatment was scheduled to cover crop water needs, a postharvest deficit irrigation (40{\%} crop evapotranspiration (ETc)) strategy was applied in the RDI treatment, while the Automatic treatment simulated the RDI but without human intervention. After two years of testing, the automated system was able to “simulate” the irrigation scheduling programmed by a human expert without the need for human intervention.},

abstract = {The Rio Cobre Irrigation Scheme, Jamaica, supplies water to 5000ha by allocating a fixed unit discharge at each offtake. A computer water management model, IRMOS, was used to assess the scheme's performance during a typical operating year and to identify water management constraints to performance. An optimal water allocation policy was used as a benchmark against which the actual performance was evaluated. The comparison identified constraints in the scheme which can be improved by a variety of measures which include modifying the water allocation policy, operational procedures and physical components of the scheme. Despite the fact that operating under an optimal water allocation policy requires more data, better monitoring and a higher calibre of staff, the analysis shows that the potential benefits far outweigh the additional costs. The process shows how the use of modelling to identify performance shortfalls followed by management (rather than infrastructural) interventions can be a valid way forward to improving scheme performance.},

abstract = {Considering global water scarcity, especially in the agricultural sector, many attempts are being made to improve water productivity and save more water. Changing irrigation systems from surface to pressurized has been one of the considerable actions in this regard. However, any attempts to do so must be evaluated in an integrated perspective at the basin level by means of relevant agro-hydrological models before making them operational. This paper aims to address this issue by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Zarrineh Rud River, the main feeding river of northwest Iran's Lake Urmia, is selected as the case study for exploring this methodology. This lake has been shrinking since 1995, and to save water and increase the basin's water productivity, improvement of pressurized systems is considered as a solution. SWAT cannot directly simulate changing the irrigation system from surface to pressurized. In this study, we use the innovative approach of applying the model to simulate different irrigation systems considering real irrigation management variables such as depth and date of each irrigation event. Also, in order to improve its performance in simulation of such systems, a comprehensive calibration procedure was used based on a wide range of data for hydrological and agricultural variables. The results showed that changing the current irrigation to a pressurized system can increase water productivity up to 15{\%} due to increases in crop yield, better water distribution and greater actual evapotranspiration. However, pressurized irrigation results in no significant change in total inflow to the lake. Notably, these systems can intensify drawdown of the basin's water table up to 20{\%}. So, any significant “real water saving” program in the basin must be associated with reduction of evapotranspiration by adopting measures like reducing cultivated areas, changing cropping patterns to less water consuming plants, or applying deficit irrigation. The applied methodology of this paper as well as the comprehensive calibration and setup of the SWAT model with the readily available hydrological and agricultural variables can be a good sample for similar works. However, further work is still needed to more broadly test this approach in areas with intensive irrigation systems.},

abstract = {Distribution Uniformity (DU) of irrigation water is important because of its effects over crop yields, operational costs, irrigation scheduling, salinity control, and system design. Traditionally, irrigation system evaluations rarely report global distribution uniformity because they do not take into account all the factors that influence uniformity across the field. The Irrigation Training and Research Center (ITRC) developed standardized procedures for the evaluation of on-farm irrigation systems. These methods estimate the global DUlq and also determine the causes and relative importance of the factors influencing the non-uniformity. This study contrasts the traditional rapid {\"{I}}TRC method used to collect data and to compute global DUlq for a hand move sprinkler irrigation system, against a global DUlq calculated with catch-can data from throughout the whole field.Six hand move sprinkler irrigation systems were designed for a single field, assuming different slope configurations, and the pressure distribution of each one was determined. The comparison assumed a simplified case where all the flow and pattern variation comes from pressure differences, assuming no wind, plugging or wear.Indoor single leg profile test results were provided by Rain Bird for a 20JH impact sprinkler with a 1/8” nozzle. Overlap patterns were generated based on the different pressures throughout the field and the resulting catch-can values were combined into a global value. This value was compared against the result of the current evaluation technique, which combines the flow rate DUlq with the overlap DUlq (obtained from measured catch-can values at an average location in the field) to predict the global DUlq. Simple multiplication as suggested by ITRC and a statistical equation were used to combine the two components.The results of this study affirm that the ITRC rapid procedure for the collection of data for distribution uniformity evaluation of hand move sprinkler systems gives excellent results. Those are as good as to the ones obtained by the systematic collection of catch-can data across the field.Simple multiplication of the DUlq component values, as is done with the ITRC evaluation programs, underestimates the system DUlq. The difference between the control values and the computed ones are at most 8{\%}. The magnitude of the error is smaller (less than 4{\%}) when alternate sets are considered.The statistical equation used to combine DUlq component values underestimates the real DUlq by less than 3{\%} when the systems have regular spacing. When the spacing is reduced there is some overestimation but the errors are less than 5{\%}. These good estimations are obtained even though the actual values of Ka for the components of the distribution uniformity were different than the 1.27 value used in the computations.},

abstract = {Foodborne illness outbreaks associated with sprouts (e.g. bean sprouts) have primarily been traced to contaminated seed. The following study demonstrated the unreliability of currently recommended hypochlorite based seed decontamination methods and spent irrigation water screening protocols. Given such limitations it was identified that more effective interventions in sprout production are required. A seed decontamination method based on a novel sanitizer (SDH) was studied in detail. The sanitizer is phyto-compatible and can be supplemented into the seed steep solution without affecting sprout development. Artificially and naturally contaminated (Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7) mung beans could be consistently decontaminated using a SDH concentration of 200ppm and contact time {\textgreater}8h. SDH could also be used to decontaminate alfalfa, amongst others, but was less effective against other seed types (e.g. radish). The main mode by which SDH inactivates bacterial pathogens was through oxidation of thiol groups (glutathione, disulfide bonds) and membrane disruption.},

abstract = {Water and nutrient absorption is closely associated with the root system structure and root characteristics. This study was designed to evaluate root characteristics of six sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) genotypes grown under full and deficit irrigation regimes in two-year rhizotube experiments. The results revealed that deficit irrigation regime resulted in higher root depth and root to shoot ratio, but the lower root length compared with that in the full irrigation regime. In addition, all the genotypes respond to deficit irrigation by increasing root depth. Although root depth increased in response to deficit irrigation, Sudan-94 genotype showed the maximum increase (44{\%}), followed by USA-ns-96 genotype (35{\%}). Similarly, root to shoot ratio increased due to deficit irrigation and Oltan and USA-ns-96 genotypes showed the maximum increase. Under deficit irrigation regime, root biomass decreased with increasing soil depth in Naz, Dashtestan-2, Darab-1, Oltan and USA-ns-96 genotypes; however, root biomass increased in Sudan-94 with increasing soil depth until a reduction was found at a depth of 0.6–0.9 m. The maximum values for dry root weight (10.89 g) and root length (25,875 mm) were related to USA-ns-96, but Sudan-94 showed the maximum root depth (114 cm) and root to shoot ratio (0.36) compared with other genotypes. Sudan-94 genotype was the only genotype in which all root traits increased due to deficit irrigation, suggesting that Sudan-94 genotype may be associated with increased tolerance to drought stress and can be considered as a desirable genotype in breeding programs.},

abstract = {In the scheduling of nutrient supply programs, analysis of plant nutrient status has been found to be useful to prevent the deficiency or toxic effects of nutrients in any horticultural crop. So the present study was framed to assess the foliage nutrient content and vegetative growth under different irrigation and fertigation combination modules. Recently apple (Malus ×domestica) orchards in the state Himachal Pradesh of India have converted from the traditional royal delicious orchard at 6 × 6 m spacing with rainfed/basin irrigation to early spur varieties on dwarfing rootstock with drip irrigation, both with or without fertigation. An experimental field trial was started at the end of 2018 in a ‘Super Chief'/MM106 orchard at an experimental farm of the department of Soil Science {\&} Water Management, Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni, Solan (HP). A factorial experiment with 16 treatment combinations of 4 irrigation levels viz. I1 – drip irrigation at 100{\%} ETc, I2 – drip irrigation at 80{\%} ETc, I3 – drip irrigation at 60{\%} ETc, I4 – conventional irrigation, and four fertigation levels viz. F0 – No fertilizer application (absolute control), F1 – 100{\%} of AD (NPK), F2 – 75{\%} of AD (NPK) and F3 – 50{\%} of AD (NPK) were replicated thrice with 3 plants in each replication. Vegetative growth parameters and leaf nutrient contents were affected by both fertilization and water rate. Irrigation and nutrient levels and their interactions exhibited significant effect on leaf N (3.10{\%}), P (0.28{\%}), K (1.77{\%}), and S (0.44{\%}) contents. Significantly maximum contents were observed in the irrigation level I1 (DI at 100{\%} ETc). Among fertigation level, F1 [100{\%} AD (NPK)] recorded highest contents of leaf N (3.17{\%}), P (0.29{\%}), K (1.80{\%}), S (0.46{\%}). Interaction I1F1 registered maximum leaf N (3.36{\%}), P (0.36{\%}), K (1.92{\%}) and S (0.63{\%}).With an increase in the water volume and an increasing dose of NPK, vegetative growth parameters, i.e., tree height, plant spread, tree volume, trunk girth, and annual extension growth were noted to increase proportionately. Treatment DI at 100{\%} ETc (I1), increased the tree height by 9.41, plant spread (EW by 32.0, NS by 16.3), tree volume by 61.36, trunk girth by 8.05, and annual extension growth by 14.22{\%} over conventional irrigation (I4).

abstract = {This commentary argues that the recently approved contract under which the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is investing US{\$}437 million dollars in Niger over the next five years, most of it on large-scale irrigation, is not a good investment. The paper explains why the programme is not likely to achieve the benefits anticipated. MCC had commissioned a detailed feasibility study, carried out by the authors of this paper, which strongly argued against investing in large-scale irrigation, in part because there is a poor track record for these investments in Niger, and in part because MCC has no comparative advantage in such investments. Instead, the feasibility study presented a strong case for investing in small-scale rainwater harvesting for agriculture and livestock at farm and watershed levels; and individualised small-scale irrigation for high-value nutritious crops and other water uses. The commentary concludes with suggestions on how the funds allocated for large-scale irrigation infrastructure (about US{\$}250 million) could be reallocated to benefit a far larger number of people; and a recommendation that investors in African agricultural water management projects carry out an assessment of the performance and impacts of investment experiences over the past decade to identify lessons that could inform the next decade of investments in agricultural water management.},

@article{Qadir2010,
abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is the driest region of the world with only 1{\%} of the world's freshwater resources. The increasing competition for good-quality water has cut into agriculture's water share but since the use of freshwater for domestic, industrial and municipal activities generates wastewater, the volume of wastewater used in agriculture has increased. About 43{\%} of wastewater generated in the MENA region is treated; a relatively high percentage compared to other developing-country dominated regions. This is because of the perceived importance of wastewater as a water resource and several oil-rich countries with the resources to treat wastewater. The MENA region has an opportunity for beneficial reuse of wastewater but few countries in the region have been able to implement substantial wastewater treatment and reuse programs. The major constraints leading to seemingly slow and uneven reuse of wastewater are: inadequate information on the status of reuse or disposal of wastewater and associated environmental and health impacts; incomplete economic analysis of the wastewater treatment and reuse options, usually restricted to financial feasibility analysis; high costs and low returns of developing wastewater collection networks and wastewater treatment plants; lack of wastewater treatment and reuse cost-recovery mechanisms and lack of commitment to support comprehensive wastewater treatment programs; mismatch between water pricing and regional water scarcity; preference for freshwater over wastewater; and inefficient irrigation and water management schemes undermining the potential of wastewater reuse. However, some countries such as Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel have policies in place that address wastewater treatment through a range of instruments. Policymakers in these countries consider use of treated wastewater to be an essential aspect of strategic water and wastewater planning and management. With flexible policy frameworks addressing rapid demographic changes and increasing water scarcity in the MENA region, water reuse has great potential if integrated with resource planning, environmental management and financing arrangements.},

abstract = {Vegetables irrigated with untreated domestic wastewater were, at the time of harvest, analysed for the presence of the faecal indicator, Escherichia coli, and helminth eggs in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Vegetables from the same harvested batch were collected approximately 12 h later from the local market. The survey found relatively low concentrations of E. coli (1.9 E. coli per gram), but relatively high concentrations of helminths (0.7 eggs per gram) on vegetables collected from agricultural fields. Higher concentration of both E. coli (14.3 E. coli per gram) and helminths (2.1 eggs per gram) were recovered from the vegetables collected from the market. The results of the survey suggest that unhygienic post harvest handling was the major source of produce contamination. Interventions at the market, such as the provision of clean water to wash produce in, are better ways to protect public health and more cost effective than wastewater treatment.},

@article{KOMAKECH20111719,
abstract = {Although spate irrigation systems are risk-prone, they can be an important component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, spate irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate irrigation systems pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream–downstream interactions between users within the system, and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and intake structures. This paper describes a spate irrigation system in Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic and sociological) of spate irrigation proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997) to assess the Makanya spate irrigation system. The Makanya spate irrigation system has an organisational structure that is similar to the canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively deals with the institutional demands of managing water in spate irrigation systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional spate irrigation practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots. Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect the existing locally developed water management arrangements.},

abstract = {For irrigation managers with limited water resources, irrigation management decisions begin well before the irrigation season. Irrigation managers with limited water supplies from restricted well capacities or water allocations need to anticipate crop selections, plan for crop rotations, and project water deliveries to each crop. A water allocation model [Crop Water Allocator (CWA) available at www.oznet.ksu.edu/mil] has been built to evaluate growing-season water allocations among two to six crops over five possible divisions of land area. Users input crop pricing, production costs, irrigation costs, and maximum crop yields. The program iterates all possible combinations of the water allocation by 10{\%} increments over all possible crop combinations and a chosen land division. Net economic return to land, labor, and irrigation equipment is calculated for each crop mix/water allocation/land division combination. Net returns are ranked, and several of the highest are presented to the user for evaluation. The influence of one variable input on another, such as water allocation, commodity prices, crop yields, annual rainfall, irrigation system efficiency, and irrigation operating costs on net return can be evaluated through multiple executions of the model.},

abstract = {Climate change, water supply limits, and continued population growth have intensified the search for measures to conserve water in irrigated agriculture, the world's largest water user. Policy measures that encourage adoption of water-conserving irrigation technologies are widely believed to make more water available for cities and the environment. However, little integrated analysis has been conducted to test this hypothesis. This article presents results of an integrated basin-scale analysis linking biophysical, hydrologic, agronomic, economic, policy, and institutional dimensions of the Upper Rio Grande Basin of North America. It analyzes a series of water conservation policies for their effect on water used in irrigation and on water conserved. In contrast to widely-held beliefs, our results show that water conservation subsidies are unlikely to reduce water use under conditions that occur in many river basins. Adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies reduces valuable return flows and limits aquifer recharge. Policies aimed at reducing water applications can actually increase water depletions. Achieving real water savings requires designing institutional, technical, and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water depletions. Conservation programs that target reduced water diversions or applications provide no guarantee of saving water.},

abstract = {A 3-year study was conducted in the Catawba-Wateree River Basin during the spring and summer months of 2009-2011 to evaluate the water savings potential of three smart irrigation controllers compared with standard timer-based irrigation controllers. Thirty-six residential sites, 12 on each of three Duke Energy lakes (Lake Norman, Lake Hickory, and Lake Wylie), were selected for the study. Each site had an automated, underground irrigation system that directly drew water from the Duke Energy lake that the property bordered. None of the systems had previously been metered and there was no charge to homeowners for withdrawing water from the bordering lake. All sites were instrumented with water meters in 2009 to monitor irrigation water withdrawals, and irrigation system audits were performed before installation of smart technologies. After collecting baseline water-use data in 2009, existing controllers were replaced with one of three smart controllers at 27 of the study sites in 2010, and irrigation was monitored through the end of the 2011 irrigation season. Irrigation treatments included a standard irrigation controller with an add-on soil moisture sensor system (SMS), an evapotranspiration (ET) based controller that received daily reference evapotranspiration estimates from a third-party provider (ET1), an evapotranspiration-based controller with an on-site weather sensor (ET2), and a comparison group that used the existing irrigation controller with no intervention (COMP). Weekly water withdrawals were monitored with on-site data loggers, and turf quality was visually rated and characterized with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) meter. The SMS treatment applied the most irrigation per week (mean of 27.4 mm week-1), compared with 24.7 mm week-1 for the ET1 treatment, and the COMP and ET2 treatments that applied 20.9 and 19.9 mm week-1, respectively. Although applying the most irrigation, the SMS treatment had the greatest effect on water-use behavior for sites receiving technologies, reducing irrigation by 11.7 mm week-1 compared with the baseline year in which the SMS group applied the most water. There was no evidence of a change in water-use behavior in the COMP treatment, but collectively the smart treatments reduced irrigation from 60{\%} more than the gross irrigation requirement (GIR) in 2009 to only 10{\%} more than GIR in 2010 and 2011, without adversely affecting the turf quality. Visual turf quality ratings in the COMP treatment were slightly less than the minimally acceptable level, which may have resulted from underirrigation during high water demand periods. Several challenges to retrofitting existing systems and issues with smart controllers were observed, including poorly designed and maintained existing irrigation systems, incompatibility between existing controllers and SMS sensor modules, failure of all nine soil-moisture sensors, communication failures in ET-based controllers, and manual overrides of smart technologies by study participants. This study emphasizes the importance of proper installation, programming, and maintenance of smart technologies on suitable irrigation systems if they are to function correctly. To maximize water savings, smart irrigation retrofits should be targeted toward systems that historically overirrigate.},

abstract = {A Diagnostic Analysis was conducted in the service area of the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District in Arizona, USA. The study was an initial step in a managed change process, named Management Improvement Program (MIP), aimed at improving the performance of the area's irrigated agricultural system. Part of the Diagnostic Analysis study focused on the performance of the irrigation district's water delivery service. The study identified areas of high and low water delivery performance, factors contributing to the observed levels of performance, and implications to on-farm water management. These findings prompted changes in the delivery system's management. Results from a post-MIP intervention study indicate that the district's water delivery performance has improved as a result of those changes, and thus, that the Diagnostic Analysis and MIP methodologies are effective tools for promoting positive change in a water delivery organization.},

@phdthesis{Manero2018,
abstract = {This thesis investigates the linkages between water supply and economic inequalities within smallholder irrigation schemes, with particular focus on Tanzania, as a key example of a developing, agrarian economy in sub-Saharan Africa. In developing countries, income inequalities are critical for poverty reduction as they determine how economic growth is distributed and, thus, to which extent the poor benefit relative to everyone else. On a global scale, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular, poverty is most prevalent in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihoods. Irrigation development is recognised as a key strategy for rural poverty reduction, although a growing body of literature questions its implications for equity and social justice. While this topic is addressed from various perspectives in the literature, there is a gap among empirical studies. Specifically, the linkages between irrigation water supply and economic inequalities at small scales have received limited attention.    To research this need, this thesis carries out quantitative, qualitative and policy investigations on two smallholder irrigation schemes in southern Tanzania. The data originates from structured household surveys, semi-structured interviews with key informants, direct infrastructure observations, maps of the irrigation schemes and documentary sources. The thesis is organised as follows: First, inequality analyses using the Gini coefficient and the Theil index are used to calculate the level and decomposition of income inequalities within six smallholder irrigation schemes in sub-Saharan Africa. Next, qualitative investigations uncover irrigators' perspectives about the association between water supply and economic inequalities within the two Tanzanian schemes. Third, multiple regression analyses evaluate the relative impact of water supply and farm location (as well as other variables) on irrigated crop income and production within smallholder irrigation schemes. Finally, an investigation of Tanzania's water and irrigation institutional framework highlights current policy shortfalls and possible strategies targeting greater equity of irrigation water supply.    This thesis' findings show that high levels of income inequality exist within agricultural communities in Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique, and that such disparities are not properly considered by development polices based upon national statistics. In particular, within smallholder irrigation schemes, inequities in water supply affect economic inequalities in multiple ways, some of which – for example erosion of human capital and social stratification — are not adequately noted in previous literature. Household characteristics and farm location are also shown to be important for irrigated crop incomes and yields. While typically regarded as a good water management practice, the transfer of responsibilities to the local level is shown in this study to be problematic for traditional irrigators. Instead, in the pursuit of greater equity of water supply, participatory process should be considered based on six key equity aspects: quantity; reliability; obligations; benefits/externalities; decision-making; and land rights.    Overall, this thesis contributes the international development and inequality literature by providing a deeper understanding of: a) the effect of irrigation water supply on economic inequalities; and b) which water policies might be changed to reduce water supply inequities within traditional irrigation systems. These findings are important to respond to rural poverty in Africa, as it is at the local scale that poverty, growth and inequality interventions can be most effective. Importantly, because a large part of the world's rural population seeks pathways out of poverty, it is critical to ensure that income-enhancing strategies, such as irrigation, do not result in aggravated economic disparities and a barrier to sustainable human development.},

Wound irrigation solution type was computer randomised and allocation was done on a sequential basis.SettingStanford University Medical Center Department of Emergency Medicine.ParticipantsPatients older than 1 year of age, who presented to the emergency department with a soft tissue laceration requiring repair, were entered into the study under informed consent. Exclusion criteria included any underlying immunocompromising illness, current use of antibiotics, puncture or bite wounds, underlying tendon or bone involvement, or wounds more than 9 h old.InterventionsNon-caregivers used a computer generated randomisation code to prepare irrigation basins prior to treatment. Patients had their wounds irrigated either with TW or SS prior to closure, controlling for the volume and irrigation method used. The patient, the treating physician and the physician checking the wound for infection were all blind regarding solution type. Structured follow-up was completed at 48 h and 30 days to determine the presence of infection.Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome measured was the difference in wound infection rates between the two randomised groups.ResultsDuring the 18-month study period, 663 consecutive patients were enrolled. After enrolment, 32 patients were later excluded; 29 patients because they were concurrently on antibiotics; two patients secondary to steroid use and one because of tendon involvement. Of the 631 remaining patients, 318 were randomised into the TW group and 313 into the SS group. Six patients were lost to follow-up (5 SS, 1 TW). A total of 625 patients were included in the statistical analysis. There were no differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups. There were 20 infections 6.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 9.1{\%} to 3.7{\%}) in the SS group compared with 11 infections 3.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 5.5{\%} to 1.5{\%}) in the TW group, a difference of 2.9{\%} (95{\%} CI −0.4{\%} to 5.7{\%}).ConclusionsThere is no difference in the infection rate of wounds irrigated with either TW or SS solution, with a clinical trend towards fewer wound infections in the TW group, making it a safe and cost-effective alternative to SS for wound irrigation.},

@article{Zardari2009,
abstract = {The rotational irrigation water delivery (warabandi) system practiced in the Indus river basin of Pakistan has continued for 100years. Irrigation water allocated to the farmers under the warabandi system is proportional to farm size and is fixed. This rigid allocation system has been partly justified by its contribution to social equity though this may have been at the cost of economic gains. In order to assess the operation of warabandi's basic rules, a farmers' survey was completed from 124 farmers located on five watercourses. A questionnaire was administered to each farmer and farm management data were gathered. As fresh water resources are under stress and becoming scarce their efficient use in all applications should be assured in water allocations. It is shown from the survey results that water allocation based on very limited criteria does not maximize the socio-economic benefits gained from the use of scarce water. Thus, it is suggested that the existence or non-existence of fresh groundwater resources along with other critical variables should be taken into consideration when making canal water allocation decisions. Missed water deliveries due to failure of the canal system appear to be the largest cause of losses. Water charges need to be increased to fund large improvements in canal maintenance programs. It is pointed out that a framework should be developed as a tool to improve water productivity for Pakistan. This should include: consideration of the gross area of a tertiary canal, sensitivity of crop growth stage to water shortage, crop value, bias of allocation towards most water use efficient areas and water use efficient crops, the potential losses from water deficiency.},

@phdthesis{Elsheikh2015,
abstract = {Due to the growing world population, agricultural production will need to increase. Yet the portion of fresh water currently available for agriculture (72{\%}) is decreasing. Under current water scarcity conditions, the limited available water would have to be used more efficiently. Previously agricultural research has focused primarily on maximizing production. In recent years, the researches focused on the production system, notably the availability of either land or water, where water is the limiting factor in crop cultivation. In regions where water scarcity is the principle limiting factor for cultivation, farmers are interested in growing crops that are able to adapt to drought conditions. The Gezira Scheme is Sudan's oldest and largest gravity irrigation system. The total area of the Gezira Scheme in the central clay plains is about 880,000 ha, located between the Blue Nile and White Nile rivers. The scheme has played an important role in the economic development of the country, and is a major source of foreign exchange. It has also contributed to the national food security and in generating a livelihood for the 2.7 million people who now live in the scheme. In the scheme the farmers do not own the land, they are tenants. The area is divided among 120,000 tenancies with an average area of about 7.3 ha. The original size of a regular tenancy in the old Gezira Scheme was 16.8 ha, but a number of tenancies have been converted to half-tenancies over the years. Tenant participation in agriculture has fallen over two generations of rising living standards and better education. It is estimated that over half of all tenants are now no longer involved in farming and most of those who are still involved, have an outside job as well. The Gezira Scheme was managed by the Sudan Gezira Board (SGB) as a government enterprise. The SGB used to work closely with the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources (MOIWR) that was responsible for the operation, maintenance and management of the main, major and minor canals (irrigation network). The SGB was responsible for the agricultural operation. It had irrigation committees along the minor canals and representatives of each of these committees constituted the Irrigation Committee at the block level. In 2005 the new act for the scheme management was established by the Sudanese government ''the Gezira Act 2005''. The responsibility of the operation and maintenance of the major and minor canals was assigned to the SGB. Based on this act the SGB established 17,000 water users groups, which are called Water Users Associations (WUA). The responsibilities of the WUAs concern operation and maintenance of the lower level canals and involvement in the operation and maintenance of the minor canals. In Gezira Scheme most of the farmers in some areas use the short rainy season from June to September for growing crops such as Sorghum and vegetables. The farming system of the Gezira Scheme is dominated by crop production. The major crops grown are Sorghum, Wheat, Groundnut and the oilseed crop Sesame. The cropping calendar is as follows: from June to July is the time for Sorghum, Cotton, Groundnut, Sesame and vegetables by using crop rotation and from November to December for growing Wheat and vegetables. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is an important oil crop in the world as well as in Sudan. It is a new edible oil crop in Sudan, the seeds have an oil content of 40 - 50{\%} and 30{\%} digestible protein and can thus be used as a source of food for humans, or as poultry feed. Sunflower cake can be used as animal feed. It can be cultivated as winter crop under irrigated conditions and as summer crop under rainfed conditions. Sunflower has become an important oil crop for both farmers and consumers in Sudan. It is a crop that fits well in the local cropping system and is considered as the most important oil crop of the country. Although experiments on Sunflower in Sudan started as early as the 1980s, commercial production started late and focused mainly on rainfed cultivation. The cultivated areas in 1990 - 1991 reached 123,000 ha with an average yield of 714 kg/ha. Recently, high yielding hybrids were introduced and grown under irrigation. In Sudan Sunflower is now grown in two seasons (winter and summer) and is recognized as a crop with high potential that can successfully meet future oil requirements. In Gezira Scheme the cultivated area with Sunflower for the summer and winter seasons of 2013 were 2570 and 619 ha respectively. While the average yield obtained from farmers fields ranged between 1.2 and 2.2 t/ha (0.5 - 0.9 t/fed). Sunflower is categorized as a low to medium drought sensitive crop. The drought-tolerant nature can be attributed to its extensive root system, which can extract water and nutrients to a depth of 3 m. The available information shows that seed yield response to water is usually greatest when Sunflower is irrigated at a late flowerbudding stage before the flowering stages. Knowledge of the effects of irrigation scheduling on Sunflower production and water productivity under water stress conditions is becoming increasingly important. Irrigation scheduling is particularly important since many field crops are more sensitive to water deficit at specific phenological stages. In crop production instead of achieving maximum yield from a unit by full irrigation, water productivity can be optimized within the concept of deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation is an optimal strategy in which irrigation is applied during drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop. Deficit irrigation has been widely investigated as a valuable and sustainable production strategy in dry regions. By limiting water applications to drought sensitive growth stages, this practice aims to maximize water productivity and to stabilize rather than maximize yield. In addition correct application of deficit irrigation requires a thorough assessment of the economic impact of the yield reduction caused by drought stress. Sunflower has several growth stages: emergence, vegetative, reproductive, flowering, seed formation and maturity. Water stress in each stage results in reduction in seed yield and oil content. The treatments, which were conducted to study the effect of water stress at different growth stages, showed that Sunflower was significantly affected by water stress that occurred in the sensitive flowering, seed formation and ripening stages. The highest yield was obtained from the treatments that were not stressed during these stages. It was also found that deficit irrigation at the early flowering stage reduced seed yield by 25{\%} by reducing both seed number and individual seed weight, while at the mid flowering stage seed yield was less affected by deficit irrigation. It was also reported that Sunflower needs to be irrigated three times with full or limited irrigation water at heading, flowering and seed filling stages for high seed yield. Sunflower is a short duration crop and can be fitted well in our present cropping system without bearing any major change in agriculture setup. The planting pattern plays a key role in increasing the yield of Sunflower. Flowering is the most critical stage to water stress caused by deficit irrigation. For this reason limited irrigation in early and mid flowering stages needs to be avoided, while deficit irrigation at seed formation can be acceptable whenever irrigation water is limited. Previous studies showed that the water requirements of Sunflower vary from 600 to 1000 mm depending on the climate and length of total growing period. High evapotranspiration rates occur during the seed setting and early ripening stage. The water requirements of Sunflower are relatively high compared to other crops. Nevertheless it has the ability to withhold short periods of soil moisture deficit up to 15 atmosphere tension. Water use of a crop with satisfactory available soil moisture supply is primarily affected by its canopy and weather conditions. These effects are represented by the seasonal crop coefficient and the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) of the atmosphere. The crop coefficient indicates the fraction of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) that the crop is expected to utilize on a given day. The crop coefficient value typically changes with the growing stage. Research on the effect of water stress on Sunflower yield and water productivity is scarce in Gezira Scheme. In this study determination of the crop water requirements and crop coefficients was the main objective. The study was carried out at the Gezira Research Station Farm to determine the crop water requirement and water productivity and to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on Sunflower yield and yield components under Gezira clay soil conditions. Three experiments were conducted to test Sunflower seed yield under different irrigation intervals and two with different intra-row plant spacing for winter and summer seasons. The first experiment was conducted to determine the crop coefficient (Kc) of Sunflower and the effect of different irrigation intervals on Sunflower yield and yield components in the winter season, and also to investigate the effect of water stress at specific growth stages. Three irrigation intervals were selected to investigate the sensitivity of two growth stages (flowering and seed filling) to water stress. Irrigation intervals of 10, 15 and 20 days were tested on the crop stage of 50{\%} flowering and on the seed filling stage, which were compared to full irrigation (weekly irrigation). Sunflower Hysun 33 (Hybrid) was selected to evaluate its water productivity and economic water productivity under seven different irrigation treatments. The evaluation was done based on the seed yield obtained from the three growing seasons: the first season started on the 14th of November 2011, the second season on the 19th of November 2012, while the third season started on the 5th of December 2013. It was concluded that the highest yield was obtained under weekly irrigation and 10 days intervals after the flowering and seed filling stages. The 20 days irrigation intervals decreased the yield with more than 40{\%}. Based on the extensive field data collection the crop coefficient of Sunflower has been determined by using the procedure recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This procedure is based on a calculation of the soil moisture content for estimating evapotranspiration. From the meteorological data obtained from the Meteorological Station located nearest to our field, the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated by using the FAO EToCalc software programme (2009). The results revealed that the crop coefficients for the initial stage, development stage, mid season and late season stages were 0.53, 1.20, 1.30 and 0.63 respectively. Under weekly irrigation a maximum seed yield of respectively 3130, 3140 and 3100 kg/ha was obtained for the first, second and third year. Irrigation at 10, 15 and 20 days intervals after the flowering stage reduced the seed yield by respectively 15, 23 and 34{\%} in the first season, while in the third season it was 8, 20 and 31{\%}. Moreover, the yield reduction in irrigation treatments of 10, 15 and 20 days after seed formation was 10, 25 and 30{\%} and 9, 24 and 26{\%} in the first and second season respectively. Highest water productivity was achieved under weekly irrigation and ranged from 0.32 to 0.36 kg/m3. The lowest one was obtained from 20 days irrigation after the flowering stage (0.21 and 0.26 kg/m3). Water deficit during the seed formation stage reduced the seed yield as compared with full irrigation, but the reduction was much less than when stress occurred during the flowering stage Net incomes from each irrigation treatment were studied to evaluate the effect of water deficit on seed yield economically. Net income depends mainly on production costs. However, 8 - 9{\%} higher inputs in production cost for 10 days irrigation intervals compared to irrigation intervals of 15 days resulted in a higher net income of US{\$}721 /ha and US{\$} 866/ha in the first and second season respectively. This revealed that the gain from higher yield is greater than the associated higher irrigation cost for this treatment. The second and third experiments were conducted in the winter and summer seasons respectively to evaluate seed yield obtained from irrigated Sunflower (10, 15 and 20 days irrigation intervals) under two intra-row plant spacings (30 and 40 cm) and tested with one cultivar Hysun 33 (Hybrid) in the winter season 2012/2013. The measurements of crop parameters such as plant height, head diameter, total seed yield and 100-seeds weight were recorded. The results of the winter experiments revealed that the highest seed yield was obtained from an irrigation interval of 10 days with 40 cm intra-row plant spacing (3290 kg/ha) followed by the 15 days interval irrespective of the intra-row plant spacing (3120 and 3050 kg/ha) in the first and second season respectively. The lowest seed yield of respectively 1890 and 1830 kg/ha was obtained from 20 days irrigation interval with both intra-row plant spacings. The highest water productivity was achieved from an irrigation interval of 15 days of 0.42 - 0.45 kg/m3 and the lowest water productivities were obtained from irrigation at 20 days interval of 0.31 - 0.32 kg/m3 under both intra-row plant spacings. The highest economic water productivity of US{\$} 0.29/m3 was obtained from an irrigation interval of 15 days in the first season and the lowest economic water productivity of US{\$} 0.17/m3 was obtained from an irrigation interval of 20 days in the first season. This shows as well that the economic indicator may be an appropriate tool for assessing impacts of deficit irrigation and water prices. The summer experiments were conducted to study the effect of different irrigation intervals compared to seed yield under rainfed conditions. Two crop varieties, Hysun 33 (Hybrid) and Bohooth-1 (local variety), were grown starting mid July 2012 and 2013 respectively. Results showed that stressing the crop up to 20 days irrigation intervals reduced seed yield between 40 and 44{\%} for Hysun 33 and between 38 and 44{\%} for Bohooth-1 in the first and second season respectively. While increasing irrigation interval to 15 days did not result in a significant reduction in seed yield (16 - 31{\%}). The results revealed that the differences between 10 and 15 days irrigation interval in seed yield were not highly significant. No significant differences were found between the two varieties in seed yield and water productivity under different irrigation treatments and intra-row plant spacing in the summer season. Compared to the 10 days interval the average amount of water applied was increased by 6{\%} and 11{\%} in the 15 days and 20 days irrigation intervals respectively. The contribution of rain in water supply was respectively 18{\%} for the 10 days, 24{\%} for the 15 days and 24{\%} for the 20 days interval. Only a part of this rain can be used to satisfy the crop water demand at the establishment stage. At this end, comparison of the results in seasonal water applied between the three irrigation treatments indicate that the 10 and 20 days intervals were recorded higher and lower in irrigation water application respectively. Higher water productivity was obtained from intervals of 10 days (0.41- 0.42 kg/m3) and 15 days (0.39 - 0.44 kg/m3) for Hysun 33 in the first and second season, while the highest water productivity (0.41 kg/m3) was obtained from the irrigation interval of 10 days irrespective of the intra-row plant spacing for Bohooth-1 in the first season and 0.39 kg/m3 was obtained from the same irrigation interval in the second season. However, there were significant differences recorded between the two treatments Benefit-cost ratios (B/C) of all full irrigation treatments were higher than 1. Therefore, we can conclude that Sunflower cultivation in Gezira Scheme with providing full irrigation at 10 days and/or 15 days intervals is an economically viable option at current market prices. The total production costs were higher under full irrigation treatment compared with the other treatments, while the benefit was more or less acceptable under the prevailing economic situations. Crop growth simulation models have been developed for predicting the effect of water and soil on biomass, grain yield and water productivity of different crops. In this study the water driven crop model AquaCrop, developed by FAO, was calibrated and validated for Sunflower under different irrigation regimes. Calibration was done by using obtained data from the experimental field of 2011 and validation with the data of 2012 and 2013. The calibrated and measured data were compared to assess the model performance. Agreement between the calibrated and measured values was quantitatively evaluated by using the root mean square error (RMSE) and the index of agreement (d). The lower the RMSE and the higher d are the better the model performance is. Statistical indicators RMSE and d suggest that the model can be used to highly reliably assess the yield and canopy cover under full and deficit irrigation conditions. In this study the AquaCrop model predicted seed yield with RMSE 0.05 - 0.16 t/ha, d 0.87 - 0.98 and canopy cover with RMSE 1.9 - 10.1{\%} and d 0.99 more precisely compared to simulated water productivity (RMSE 0.10 - 0.14 kg/m3 and d 0.27 - 0.64). There was a tendency to over-estimate water productivity for all irrigation treatments for the winter season. The AquaCrop model followed the same trend in predicting seed yield and water productivity under summer conditions. The seed yields were predicted with RMSE of 0.01 - 0.12 t/ha and d 0.89 - 0.99 and the difference between predicted and measured values was 3.1 - 16.7{\%}. The model over-estimated the water productivity with RMSE 0.01 - 0.03 kg/m3 and d 0.31 - 0.88 while the deviation was 9.8 - 37.5{\%} of all irrigation treatments. Based on these results application of the AquaCrop model is recommended under conditions of limited data and yield predictions under different water supply. Accordingly, based on the results of the study it is recommended to conduct research programs to adopt deficit irrigation as a new irrigation strategy with recommended agronomic practices that would increase yield and water productivity under Gezira conditions. In addition, it is recommended to consider optimum water use applications for Sunflower that maximize yield and returns on irrigation water under different climatic conditions and changing market prices Deficit irrigation has been conducted in different field trials to assess its effect on Sunflower yield and water productivity. Results showed that the yields obtained under different irrigation levels were higher compared to farmers yield even under severe water stress. Moreover, water productivity was higher when the crop received less water compared to full irrigation. Thus, these results confirm that irrigation at 15 days interval (mild water stress) would be acceptable for improving water productivity when there is water shortage during the growing season. When land is not a limiting factor, intra-row plant spacing of 40 cm would have to be practiced with irrigation at 10 days interval for maximizing yield and to gain more profit.},

abstract = {The Sultanate of Oman is an arid country with scarce water resources mainly consisting of groundwater. Aflaj are artificial canals constructed centuries ago to transfer horizontally the groundwater to a location at the surface. The water quality of these Aflaj is a very important factor to be considered for healthy and safe use of this water. This paper aimed to study the characteristics of the groundwater through its journey in Aflaj from source point up to its usage point. An experimental programme was adopted to investigate the water quality of Al Hammam Aflaj in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. The results showed that some positions of the Falaj have high content of some elements, such as Ca, above the allowable values of drinking water standards. Results proved that the water of Al Hammam Falaj in general can be used with caution as a drinking water; however, some care and monitoring should be applied regularly. Results of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and soluble sodium percentage (SSP) equations revealed that the water Falaj can be used for irrigation for all soil types but cannot be used on soils with restricted drainage due to its relatively high salinity.},

abstract = {Concerns have been raised over the impacts of cannabis farms on the environment and water resources in particular, yet data on cultivation practices and water use patterns and have been limited. Estimates of water use for cannabis cultivation have previously relied on extrapolated values of plant water demand, which are unable to account for differences in cultivation practices, variation across the growing season, or the role of water storage in altering seasonal extraction patterns. The current study uses data reported by enrollees in California's North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) Cannabis Program to model how variation in cultivation practices and the use of stored water affect the timing and amount of water extracted from the environment. We found that the supplemental use of stored water resulted in a seasonal pattern of water extraction (i.e. water withdrawals from the environment) that was distinct from water demand (i.e. water applied to plants). Although water input to storage in the off-season months (November through March) reduced water extraction in the growing season (April through October), farms generally did not have sufficient storage to completely forbear from surface water extraction during the growing season. Beginning in 2019, forbearance will be required during this period for those in the regulated cannabis industry. The two most important predictors of storage sufficiency (type of storage infrastructure and seasonality of water source) also had reliable effects on seasonal extraction patterns, further emphasizing the link between water storage and extraction profiles. These findings suggest that resource managers and policy makers should consider the ways in which cultivation practices drive water extraction patterns and how these practices may be influenced by participation in the regulated cannabis industry.},

As of 2019, state cannabis regulations require forbearance from surface water diversions from April through October. To comply, farms relying on surface water must either develop storage, reduce water demand, or seek alternative water sources, such as groundwater. Our findings indicate that water extraction from farms using groundwater wells generally occurs during the summer dry season and highlight the need to assess their potential impacts to connected surface water in streams. Finally, given that the current study was based on data exclusively from permitted cannabis farms, additional data from unpermitted operations would enhance our overall understanding of cannabis water-use practices and consequences for the environment.},

Experiments were carried out in split plots in randomized blocks with three replications. The application of irrigation water was based on cumulative class A pan evaporation within irrigation intervals. Study treatments consisted of one irrigation interval (7 days); the two sugar beet varieties (C1: Esperanza and C2: Calixta) and three different irrigation levels (I1, I2, and I3) adjusted according to the class A pan evaporation (Epan) using three different plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.5; Kcp2: 0.75; and Kcp3: 1.00). The lowest and the highest values of irrigation water and plant water consumption (Et) were observed in the I1 and I3 treatments in both years, respectively. In 2012, the lowest and the highest root yields were observed in the I3C1 (85.38tha−1) and I2C2 (75.10tha−1) treatments. In the second experimental year, the lowest and the highest root yields were achieved with the I3C1 (66.13tha−1) and I1C2 (47.57tha−1) treatments, respectively. The impact on the examined parameters of irrigation programs in the C2 treatment had not significant. On the other hand, in the C1 treatment of irrigation programs had a significant effect on sugar rate, sugar yield, and other parameters. If the economic yield and quality are desired, the I1C1 treatment can be suggested for sugar beet production under the similar soil and climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Reducing overall water diversions for agriculture, while maintaining or increasing production to keep up with increasing world population, has been and will continue to be a challenge. Yet there is not good agreement regarding the programs needed to improve the productivity of agricultural water use, nor what increases are feasible. It is recognized that field irrigation is inherently nonuniform. So also is the distribution of water to users and water delivery service nonuniform. Here, we suggest that crop-scale irrigation uniformity can be examined at a project scale by understanding how field, farm and project irrigation systems contribute to nonuniformity. We also discuss the interrelation between project scale uniformity and the relative irrigation water supply, and their combined impact on project productivity. We provide an example which relates internal measures of project performance (e.g., water distribution operations) and external measures of project performance (e.g., project-wise water productivity).},

abstract = {In arid environments, water shortages due to over-allocation of river flow are often compensated by lift irrigation or pumping groundwater. In such environments, farmers using pumped irrigation can deploy on-farm energy-efficient and water-saving technologies; however, pumping water requiring extra energy is associated with carbon emissions. This study explores how to increase crop production using pumped irrigation with minimal energy and carbon emissions. The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to examine on-farm energy consumption and carbon emissions in gravity and groundwater irrigation systems; and second, to explore system-level alternatives of power generation and water management for food production based on the results from the farm-level analysis. This study employs a novel system-level approach for addressing water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs under pumped irrigation using groundwater. These tradeoffs are assessed at farm and system levels. On-farm level estimates showed that farm-level interventions were insufficient to produce mutual gains. According to the results of the system-level evaluation, system-level interventions for water and energy conservation, the use of renewable energy to pump water for irrigation, and river basin scale cooperation are all required to maintain crop production while reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.},

@phdthesis{Zhang2013,
abstract = {Water is increasingly becoming a limiting factor for sustainable economic growth and development, particularly in developing countries. Besides technical innovations, water institution reforms may contribute to improving water allocation decisions. Appropriately designed water institutions can motivate water users to conserve and use water efficiently for irrigation and other uses. In northern China, growing demands on agricultural water due to relatively low water availability and increasing grain production are putting more and more pressure on improving water resource management. The Ministry of Water Resources of the P.R. China has initiated a number of pilot projects to gain experience with the development of water-saving irrigation systems. These pilot projects focus on the construction of engineering systems as well as institutional innovations in water resource management. Analysing the household-level effects of the implemented measures is hence of great importance for further policy development. The project ‘Building a Water-saving Society in Zhangye City', initiated early 2002 in Zhangye City in northwest China, is the first pilot project of this kind in China. It provides a unique opportunity to examine the economic effects of changes in water policies and institutions. Minle County, the research area for this study, is located within Zhangye City. A large potato processing company was established in Minle County in 2008. After the factory started its activities, the local government intervened in the allocation of irrigation water within the region by assigning more water to a specific variety of potatoes (i.e. Atlantic potatoes) that the factory needs for processing. This further makes Minle County an interesting case for analysing the link between output market development and institutional change in irrigation water management. The general objective of this study is to empirically investigate the household-level impacts of policies and institutional changes in irrigation water use. From this general objective, the following four specific objectives are defined and analysed in separate chapters. 1) To examine the impact of the institutional setup of Water Users Associations (WUAs) on productivity of irrigation water use by the WUA member households, based on a user-based resource governance framework. 2) To analyse the effects of a policy affecting the availability of water for different crops on farmers' acreage allocation among crops. 3) To evaluate the internal valuation (i.e. marginal value) of irrigation water, before and after the introduction of the water policy as explained above. 4) To investigate the effects of output market development on irrigation water trading. The information used for the empirical analyses mainly comes from two surveys that were carried out in Minle County in May 2008 and May 2010. These surveys cover information for the years 2007 and 2009, that is before and after the potato processing factory became operational. A stratified sampling approach was used for selecting the households and WUAs to be interviewed in the surveys. Additional interviews were held by the author in August 2010 with the Water Management Bureaus (WMBs) that are responsible for water allocation within the seven irrigation areas in Minle County. Chapter 2 investigates the underlying causes of differences in WUA performance by analysing the impact of WUA characteristics on the productivity of irrigation water use. Total crop production value and household income obtained from crop production, both expressed per m3 of water, are used as dependent variables in the empirical analysis. The explanatory variables in the analysis are derived from an established user-based resource governance framework, that specifies the conditions under which user groups are expected to sustainably govern common-pool resources. These conditions are grouped into resource characteristics, group characteristics, relationships between resources and user groups, and the external environment (markets, technology). Applying a random intercept model, the estimation results show that group characteristics, particularly group size and number of water users groups, and the existing pressure on available water resources are important WUA characteristics explaining water productivity. Chapter 3 analyses the impact of the local government intervention in irrigation water allocation on farmers' crop planting decisions. A system of unconditional crop acreage demand functions depending on prices of variable inputs, levels of quasi-fixed inputs and prices of outputs is estimated. Two hypotheses are tested: Firstly, the government intervention results in an increase in land allocated to Atlantic potatoes and a decrease in land allocated to other crops; Secondly, among the alternative crops (i.e. other crops than Atlantic potatoes), the water policy is expected to cause a relatively small response for grain crops, because grains are mainly used for domestic consumption. The empirical results do not support the first hypothesis. The increased water allocation to Atlantic potatoes does not significantly affect the land allocated to this crop, because its planting decisions are mainly taken by village leaders instead of households. Instead, the intervention results in a shift from planting potatoes towards grains with relatively low water requirements.The second hypothesis is partly supported by the empirical results. The estimated impact of the government intervention is found to be stronger for local potato varieties than for grains, but the impact on the area planted with cash crops does not differ significantly from zero. Output prices seem to play a more important role in cash crop planting decisions than the water allocation intervention. Chapter 4 examines the economic valuation (i.e. marginal value) of irrigation water, before and after the local government intervention in water allocation. To accomplish this, a system of translog production functions is estimated. Two hypotheses are tested: Firstly, the valuation of irrigation water is expected to be equal across different crops before the start of the new water policy. And secondly, valuation of irrigation water is expected to be lower for Atlantic potatoes as compared to the alternative crops after the water policy change. The empirical results do not support the first hypothesis. The valuation of irrigation water used on grain crops is very low, and is even below the actual water prices charged to farm households. This is probably due to self-consumption of grain by households, and to government subsidies for grain farmers that are based on the planted area with grains. The second hypothesis is supported by the empirical results, except for grains. The valuation of irrigation water used on Atlantic potatoes is lower than the value of water used on other (non-grain) crops. Moreover, the returns for irrigation water used on other crops are higher in the year after the water allocation intervention than in the year before the intervention. Chapter 5 aims to provide insights into the impact of output market development on the trading of water use rights by farm households. Theresults of the two farm household surveys indicate that water markets have emerged at a small scale in response to the development of the potato market in Minle County. Observed water trade in the second survey, that was held after the establishment of the potato processing factory, consists mainly of the exchange of water without payment between relatives or neighbours, and seems to be meant to improve the timing of water applications to crops with different seasonal water requirements. Those who have started trading water rights tend to have more land with water use rights than other potato farmers. High transaction costs and information asymmetry between the government and water users, however, severely constrain the trading of water use rights in the region. Chapter 6 summarizes and integrates the main findings, discusses the policy implications and the limitations of the research, and presents some suggestions for further research.Alternate abstract:Water is in toenemende mate een beperkende factor aan het worden voor duurzame economische groei en ontwikkeling, met name in ontwikkelingslanden. Naast technische vernieuwingen kunnen hervormingen van waterinstituties een bijdrage leveren aan het verbeteren van beslissingen inzake watertoewijzing. Waterinstituties die op een juiste wijze ontworpen zijn, kunnen watergebruikers motiveren om water te besparen en effici{\"{e}}nt te gebruiken voor irrigatie en andere doeleinden. In het Noorden van China leidt de stijgende vraag naar water voor gebruik in de landbouw door een relatief geringe waterbeschikbaarheid en toenemende graanproductie, tot een steeds grotere druk om het waterbeheer te verbeteren. Het Ministerie van Waterstaat van de Volksrepubliek China heeft een aantal proefprojecten ge{\"{i}}nitieerd om ervaring te verwerven met het ontwikkelen van waterbesparende irrigatiesystemen. Deze proefprojecten zijn gericht op het construeren van technische systemen alsook op institutionele vernieuwingen in waterbeheer. Het analyseren van de effecten van de genomen maatregelen op het niveau van huishoudens is derhalve van groot belang voor verdere beleidsontwikkeling. Het project ‘Opzetten van een Waterbesparende Samenleving in Zhangye City', dat begin 2002 ge{\"{i}}nitieerd werd in de prefectuur Zhangye City in het noordwesten van China, is het eerste proefproject van dit type in China. Het biedt een unieke gelegenheid om onderzoek te doen naar de economische effecten van veranderingen in waterbeleid en -instituties. Het district Minle County, het onderzoeksgebied van deze studie, ligt binnen Zhangye City. In 2008 vestigde zich in het district Minle County een groot aardappelverwerkend bedrijf. Nadat de fabriek gestart was met zijn activiteiten, intervenieerde de lokale overheid in de toewijzing van irrigatiewater binnen het gebied en stelde meer water beschikbaar voor een specifieke 134 aardappelras (‘Atlantic'), dat de fabriek nodig heeft voor verwerking. Om die reden is het district Minle County tevens een interessante casus voor de analyse van het verband tussen productmarktontwikkeling en institutionele verandering in het beheer van irrigatiewater. Het algemene doel van deze studie is het verrichten van empirisch onderzoek naar de effecten op huishoudniveau van beleid en institutionele veranderingen betreffende het gebruik van irrigatiewater. Op basis van dit algemene doel worden de volgende vier specifieke doeleinden gedefinieerd en behandeld in afzonderlijke hoofdstukken: 1) Analyse van de invloed van de institutionele opbouw van watergebruikersverenigingen (Water Users Associations, ofwel WUA's) op de productiviteit van irrigatiewater gebruikt door huishoudens die deel uitmaken van een WUA, op basis van een gebruikers-geori{\"{e}}nteerd theoretisch raamwerk van het beheer van hulpbronnen. 2) Analyse van de effecten van een beleid dat de waterbeschikbaarheid voor verschillende gewassen be{\"{i}}nvloedt, op het landareaal dat boeren aan de verschillende gewassen toewijzen. 3) Evaluatie van de interne waardering (marginale waarde) van irrigatiewater, v{\'{o}}{\'{o}}r en na invoering van het hierboven beschreven waterbeleid. 4) Analyse van de effecten van productmarktontwikkeling op handel in irrigatiewater. De informatie die werd gebruikt voor de empirische analyses is hoofdzakelijk afkomstig uit twee enqu{\^{e}}tes die werden uitgevoerd in het district Minle County, in mei 2008 en mei 2010. Deze enqu{\^{e}}tes bevatten informatie over de jaren 2007 en 2009, dat wil zeggen v{\'{o}}{\'{o}}r en na het operationeel worden van de aardappelverwerkende fabriek. Bij de selectie van huishoudens en WUA's die tijdens de enqu{\^{e}}tes zouden worden ge{\"{i}}nterviewd, werd gebruik gemaakt van een gelaagde steekproef. In augustus 2010 werden door de auteur aanvullende interviews afgenomen bij de Watermanagementbureaus (WMB's) die verantwoordelijk zijn voor watertoewijzing binnen de zeven irrigatiegebieden in het district Minle County. In Hoofdstuk 2 worden de onderliggende oorzaken voor prestatieverschillen van de WUA's onderzocht door middel van een analyse van de impact van WUA-kenmerken op de 135 productiviteit van irrigatiewater. De totale waarde van de geproduceerde gewassen en het huishoudinkomen verkregen uit die gewassen, beide uitgedrukt per kubieke meter water, worden gebruikt als afhankelijke variabelen in de empirische analyse. De verklarende variabelen in de analyse zijn afgeleid van een gevestigd gebruikersgeori{\"{e}}nteerd theoretisch raamwerk van het beheer van hulpbronnen dat de voorwaarden specificeert waaronder gebruikersgroepen verondersteld worden gemeenschappelijke hulpbronnen duurzaam te beheren. Deze voorwaarden worden in een viertal groepen verdeeld, t.w. kenmerken van de hulpbron, groepskenmerken, verbanden tussen hulpbronnen en gebruikersgroepen, en externe omgeving (markten, technologie). De resultaten van een zg. random intercept-model geven aan dat groepskenmerken, met name groepsgrootte en aantal watergebruikersgroepen, en de bestaande druk op beschikbare waterbronnen, belangrijke factoren zijn in de verklaring van waterproductiviteit. In Hoofdstuk 3 wordt de impact van een interventie van de lokale overheid in de toewijzing van irrigatiewater op beslissingen van boeren betreffende de aanplant van gewassen geanalyseerd. Er wordt een empirische schatting gemaakt van een systeem van onvoorwaardelijke gewasareaal-vraagfuncties, met prijzen van variabele inputs, niveaus van quasi-vaste inputs en productprijzen als verklarende variabelen. Twee hypotheses worden getoetst: ten eerste, de overheidsinterventie resulteert in een toename van het areaal waarop Atlantic aardappels worden geteeld en resulteert in een afname van het areaal met andere gewassen; ten tweede, wat betreft de andere gewassen wordt verwacht dat de interventie een relatief kleine respons oplevert voor granen, aangezien granen hoofdzakelijk gebruikt worden voor eigen consumptie door huishoudens. De eerste hypothese wordt niet ondersteund door de empirische resultaten. De toegenomen watertoewijzing aan Atlantic aardappels heeft geen significante invloed op het landareaal waarop dit gewas wordt geteeld, aangezien de plantbeslissingen betreffende Atlantic 136 aardappels hoofdzakelijk genomen worden door de dorpsleiders in plaats van huishoudens. In plaats daarvan resulteert de interventie in een verschuiving in het areaal beplant met aardappels naar granen met relatief geringe waterbehoeften. De tweede hypothese wordt gedeeltelijk ondersteund door de empirische resultaten. De geschatte impact van de overheidsinterventie blijkt sterker te zijn voor lokale aardappelrassen dan voor granen, maar de impact op het areaal dat beplant wordt met marktgewassen verschilt niet significant van nul. Marktprijzen lijken een belangrijker rol te spelen bij de plantbeslissingen voor marktgewassen dan de interventie in de watertoewijzing. In Hoofdstuk 4 wordt de economische waardering (marginale waarde) onderzocht van irrigatiewater, voor en na interventie door de lokale overheid in de watertoewijzing. Om dit te realiseren wordt een empirische schatting gemaakt van een systeem van translogproductiefuncties. Er worden twee hypothesen getoetst: ten eerste, met betrekking tot de waardering van irrigatiewater wordt verwacht dat deze gelijk voor de verschillende gewassen voor de interventie in de watertoewijzing. En ten tweede wordt verwacht dat na de waterbeleidswijziging de waardering van irrigatiewater lager zal zijn voor Atlantic aardappelen dan voor alternatieve gewassen. De eerste hypothese wordt niet ondersteund door de empirische resultaten. De waardering van irrigatiewater dat wordt gebruikt in graangewassen is erg laag en ligt zelfs lager dan de feitelijke waterprijzen die aan boerenhuishoudens in rekening worden gebracht. Dit is waarschijnlijk te verklaren uit het eigen gebruik van graan door huishoudens en uit overheidssubsidies aan graanboeren die worden gebaseerd op het areaal dat met graan beplant is. De tweede hypothese wordt ondersteund door de empirische resultaten, behalve voor granen. De waardering van irrigatiewater voor Atlantic aardappelen ligt lager dan de waarde van water voor andere gewassen, behalve graan. Bovendien liggen de opbrengsten van irrigatiewater dat gebruikt 137 wordt voor andere gewassen, hoger in het jaar na de interventie in de watertoewijzing dan in het jaar voorafgaand aan de interventie. Hoofdstuk 5 is gericht op het verkrijgen van inzicht in de impact van marktontwikkeling voor landbouwproducten op de handel in watergebruiksrechten door boerenhuishoudens. De resultaten van de twee enqu{\^{e}}tes onder boerenhuishoudens geven aan dat er op kleine schaal waterrechten verhandeld worden als respons op de ontwikkeling van de aardappelmarkt in het district Minle County. De waargenomen handel in water tijdens de tweede enqu{\^{e}}te, die gehouden werd na komst van de aardappelverwerkende fabriek, bestaat voornamelijk uit het uitwisseling van water zonder betaling tussen verwanten of buren, en lijkt bedoeld te zijn om de timing van het watergebruik in gewassen met verschillende seizoensafhankelijke waterbehoeftes te verbeteren. Degenen die waterrechten zijn gaan verhandelen zijn gewoonlijk in bezit van meer grond met watergebruiksrechten dan andere aardappelboeren. Hoge transactiekosten en informatieasymmetrie tussen overheid en watergebruikers beperken echter in hoge mate het verhandelen van waterrechten in het gebied. In Hoofdstuk 6 worden de belangrijkste bevindingen samengevat en ge{\"{i}}ntegreerd, worden de beleidsimplicaties en de beperkingen van het onderzoek besproken, en worden enige suggesties gedaan voor nader onderzoek.},

abstract = {Water scarcity is a severe and growing global challenge. Over the last 50 years, water withdrawals have tripled due to economic development and rapid population growth, placing serious pressure on the planet's water systems. Agriculture remains the most significant consumer of water, accounting for approximately 75{\%} of all global water use. Millions of rural agriculture-dependent farmers in Africa, Asia and the Middle East already face devastating shortages of irrigation water, a situation that will have severe implications for food security and economic development across the globe. Therefore, efficient irrigation water management is critical to meet the growing demand for water resources. My dissertation seeks to determine the impact of a development project committed to improving irrigation management in Kyrgyzstan. The research focused on the Water Users' Association Support Program (WUASP), a project dedicated to building the capacity of local institutions of irrigators known as Water Users' Association (WUAs) through social mobilization, institutional development and participatory rehabilitation. An interrupted panel design and fixed effects regression methods are used to isolate the program effect. Additionally, data from a large N probability survey is used to explore the program's association with four behavioral mechanisms -- knowledge, participation, attitudes and social capital -- that link WUASP to irrigation management outcomes. Furthermore, my quantitative methods are supplemented by qualitative data from focus groups, interviews and participant observation collected over nine months of field research. The results indicate that the program improved irrigation management outcomes; these results were mediated by a WUA's size, economic and social heterogeneity, as well as ecological scarcity. Moreover, the analysis points to a positive program association with the mechanisms of knowledge, participation and attitudes. However, there is no evidence of a positive effect for women or water users located at the end of a canal, and the program failed to generate a positive community dynamic over irrigation. Thus, while WUASP may have promoted efficiency gains among the elite or privileged groups, the findings suggest that in cases of significant economic inequality, the program either had no effect or may have inadvertently increased the disparity between powerful and powerless water users.

abstract = {Water scarcity is a severe and growing global challenge. Over the last 50 years, water withdrawals have tripled due to economic development and rapid population growth, placing serious pressure on the planet's water systems. Agriculture remains the most significant consumer of water, accounting for approximately 75{\%} of all global water use. Millions of rural agriculture-dependent farmers in Africa, Asia and the Middle East already face devastating shortages of irrigation water, a situation that will have severe implications for food security and economic development across the globe. Therefore, efficient irrigation water management is critical to meet the growing demand for water resources.My dissertation seeks to determine the impact of a development project committed to improving irrigation management in Kyrgyzstan. The research focused on the Water Users' Association Support Program (WUASP), a project dedicated to building the capacity of local institutions of irrigators known as Water Users' Association (WUAs) through social mobilization, institutional development and participatory rehabilitation. An interrupted panel design and fixed effects regression methods are used to isolate the program effect. Additionally, data from a large N probability survey is used to explore the program's association with four behavioral mechanisms – knowledge, participation, attitudes and social capital – that link WUASP to irrigation management outcomes. Furthermore, my quantitative methods are supplemented by qualitative data from focus groups, interviews and participant observation collected over nine months of field research.The results indicate that the program improved irrigation management outcomes; these results were mediated by a WUA's size, economic and social heterogeneity, as well as ecological scarcity. Moreover, the analysis points to a positive program association with the mechanisms of knowledge, participation and attitudes. However, there is no evidence of a positive effect for women or water users located at the end of a canal, and the program failed to generate a positive community dynamic over irrigation. Thus, while WUASP may have promoted efficiency gains among the elite or privileged groups, the findings suggest that in cases of significant economic inequality, the program either had no effect or may have inadvertently increased the disparity between powerful and powerless water users.},

@phdthesis{Oorthuizen2003,
abstract = {This book investigates the management of an irrigation system in the Philippines and the impact of reform policies on its management. The 'Philippine experience' has long been a model for irrigation management reforms throughout Asia. Both the reforms of the NIA, the National Irrigation Administration, and the participatory approach for farmers' involvement in system management were widely argued to be successful and worthwhile to be copied elsewhere. This book examines the impact of these policies and critically engages with its claimed successes. Policy studies in irrigation management tend to be rather functionalistic. They often look at what goes in - the policies - and what comes out - the results. The study presented in this book took a different approach. Eighteen months of fieldwork in an irrigation system enabled me to open up the blackbox of irrigation system management. The book takes a close look at how people organise themselves, how they manage an irrigation system and deal with reform, and why they choose to do so. Moreover, it examines how these practices are embedded in wider state-society relations. By doing so, a fascinating world comes into sight. It is, basically, a world of struggle involving the NIA engineers and fieldworkers, farmer leaders and local politicians. The most visible struggle is about the distribution of scarce water in this large-scale canal system. During the dry season people go out, often at night, to secure water in the main system. Farmer leaders build alliances with local politicians and NIA staff to bring the water to their areas. Then there is struggle about the allocation of scarce funds for physical works like de-silting canals and re-gravelling roads. As some people are more equal or effective than others, the management of the system produces bountiful harvests as well as withering crops, both passable and unpassable roads, and both successful and failed political campaigns. There is more to physical works then just getting your road or canal fixed. The book explores a complicated arena in which deals are made over lucrative work contracts. It involves higher-level politicians and is interwoven with the career possibilities of the NIA engineers. Finally, there is a struggle over wages. Since the NIA became financially autonomous in the early 1980s, NIA personnel need to earn their own wages through fee collection from the farmer water users. As the NIA services went down over the years, making farmers pay took a lot of effort and strategizing on the side of the NIA managers and fieldworkers. These struggles are understood in the context of three different but inter-related types of policy reforms that changed the management of the system. I show how the different local actors give meaning to these policies and how they adopt, resist or transform them. Firstly, starting in the early 1980s streamlining policies forced the NIA to drastically downsize its number of staff. Secondly, the change to financial autonomy induced cost-cutting as well as different measures to increase the income of the NLA's organisation managing the system. Finally, so-called turn over policies contracted out management tasks to farmers organised in associations and federations. Though these policies did not work out as planned, they had a great impact on the management of the system and the relations between the different actors. I examine the everyday realities of these policy interventions and discuss how effective they are.},

abstract = {Water use by cannabis cultivators represents an emerging threat to
surface flows in Northern California's sensitive watersheds. To date,
however, no data has been available to formally assess where cannabis
sites source their water. This study analyzed data from annual reports,
covering the year 2017, submitted by 901 cannabis cultivators enrolled
in the Cannabis Waste Discharge Regulatory Program administered by the
North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. The analysis
identified cannabis cultivators' most common sources for water
extraction, monthly patterns for each water source and differences
between sites compliant and not compliant with the cannabis program. The
most commonly reported source of water was wells (58{\%} of sites), with
most extraction from wells occurring during the growing season (April
through October). Surface water diversions (22{\%} of sites) and spring
diversions (16{\%} of sites) were the most common sources after wells,
with extractions from these sources distributed much more evenly across
the year. Although nearly one-third of noncompliant sites (33{\%}) used
wells, this source was more than twice as frequently reported among
compliant sites (68{\%}), indicating that wells may become increasingly
common as more sites become part of the regulated cannabis industry.},

abstract = {Broadleaves, grasses, and nutsedge species are persistent problems with limited management options for strawberry growers in Florida. Field experiments were conducted in 2015-2016 (year 1) and 2016-2017 (year 2) at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Balm, FL, to evaluate weed control and strawberry tolerance to herbicides applied through the drip irrigation. 2940 g ai ha−1 EPTC, 105 g ai ha−1 flumioxazin, 570 g ai ha−1 fomesafen, 52 g ai ha−1 halosulfuron, 3585 g ai ha−1 napropamide, oxyfluorfen 560 g ai ha−1, and 1070 g ai ha−1 S-metolachlor were applied through a single drip tape at 7 or 14 d prior to transplanting. Halosulfuron was the most injurious herbicide, causing 18 and 46{\%} injury at 35 d after transplanting (DATP) in year 1 when the herbicide was applied 7 and 14 d prior to transplanting, respectively. However, strawberry plants recovered from the initial injury and there was no reduction in total berry yield. None of the other herbicides evaluated elicited significant crop injury nor reduced berry yield. Averaged over application timings, EPTC, fomesafen, and napropamide suppressed yellow nutsedge emergence to 49, 64, and 41{\%} of the nontreated control, respectively. Flumioxazin, fomesafen, and halosulfuron suppressed black medic emergence to 55, 52, and 55{\%} of the nontreated control, respectively. None of the herbicides evaluated adequately suppressed Carolina geranium. Overall, results suggest that the evaluated herbicides with the exception of halosulfuron are safe for use on strawberry and would give growers an alternative management option. Drip-applied herbicides permit application closer to the transplant date and would be helpful as part of a weed control program for weed suppression.},

abstract = {Policies of devolving management of resources from the state to user groups are premised upon the assumption that users will organize and take on the necessary management tasks. While experience has shown that in many places users do so and are very capable, expansion of co-management programs beyond initial pilot sites often shows that this does not happen everywhere. Yet, much is at stake in this, with more widespread adoption of irrigation management transfers and other forms of community-based resource management. It is therefore important to move beyond isolated case studies to comparative analysis of the conditions for collective action. 

This paper identifies factors affecting organization of water users associations, and collective action by farmers in major canal irrigation systems in India, based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of a stratified sample of 48 minors in four irrigation systems (two each in Rajasthan and Karnataka). Using key variables suggested by the theoretical and case study literature, the study first examines the conditions under which farmers are likely to form formal or informal associations at the level of the minor (serving several watercourses, and one or more villages). Results indicate that organizations are more likely to be formed in larger commands, closer to market towns, and in sites with religious centers and potential leadership from college graduates and influential persons, but head/tail location does not have a major effect. We then examine factors affecting two different forms of collective action related to irrigation systems: collective representation and maintenance of the minors. Lobbying activities are not more likely where there are organizations, but organizations do increase the likelihood of collective maintenance work.},

abstract = {The knowledge today recaps that's livelihood of many African farmers are constrained by poor access to both inputs and
output markets, limited entrepreneurial skills for adding value to produce and to bargain for better prices and finally limited
technical skills in agricultural production. Despite a tremendous attention to salvage this through government interventions
and research, there is still a big problem in addressing the smallholder farmer's needs. Farmer organizations open up
opportunities for farmers to better overcome the above mentioned constraints through lobbying and collective action.
Drawing from results of Participatory diagnosis and participatory market research done in Nkhate irrigation scheme in 2007
and 2008 this paper examines the effect of effective farmer groups in influencing rice price formation. Results demonstrated
that farmer groups have the potential to effectively influence policy outcomes in their favour. This was however achieved
through reorganization and mobilization of farmer groups to improve lobbying efficiency and reduce the inefficiencies
caused by free riding. The results indicate that from the participatory gross margin analysis which was done by CIAT (
2007) with rice farmers at the irrigation scheme, it was revealed that farmers have been making losses in the marketing of
Kirombero and Super Fire rice varieties and have been realizing a very small positive margin for Mtupatupa a local rice
variety. The analysis revealed gross margins of 36.78 US{\$} ha-1, -182.50 US{\$} ha-1, and 60.36 US{\$} ha-1, for Super fire,
Kirombero and Mtupatupa varieties respectively. This shows that farmers were making losses when they sold rice to traders
at a price dictated to them. However, after farmers were effectively organised in a group and linked to markets, farmers
realized gross margins of 681.84US{\$} ha-1, 664.23US{\$} ha-1 and 1,028.69US{\$} ha-1 for Mtupatupa, Super fire and Kirombero
rice varieties respectively. The paper further recommends that such farmer groups need to better articulate and deliver
benefits to members hence ensuring that these members subscribe to the group and hence finance lobbying efforts which are
often costly.},

abstract = {Long-term effects of deficit irrigation on yield and water productivity of peach trees (Prunus persica L., cv. Carnival) grown in a semi-arid climate in northern Tunisia (36°41'N, 10°15'E) were investigated. Continuous deficit irrigation (Di I-II-III) was compared with the grower's irrigation programme (Control). The effects of Di I-II-III on yield and fruit quality were analysed. The benefit of deficit irrigation strategy in terms of water saving and agricultural water productivity (W(p)) were estimated. Different relationships were investigated between yield, fruit quality, and W(p), and irrigation and total water supply. In reference to the high water needs of late cultivar Carnival for irrigation, Di I-II-III led to an important water saving (33{\%}) with a yield reduction of 14{\%}. Yield and fruit quality seemed to be related to watering regimes. Fruit dry matter (DM) decreased linearly with irrigation water supply for both Control and Di I-II-III. Unlike yield, Di I-II-III improved the dry weight of fruit. Consequently, W(p) was enhanced to reach a mean value of 0.62 kg DM m ³ in contrast to 0.54 kg DM m ³ for the Control. Continuous deficit irrigation is a valuable tool for improving W(p) in peach orchards, achieving significant water saving and maintaining sustainable production levels.},

abstract = {Water is the most important resource and limiting factor for agricultural development. In Saudi Arabia, the agricultural sector consumes more that 85{\%} of the total annual water consumption. Recently, the demand on water for agriculture has increased which has resulted in water shortages in many regions of the country particularly the old oasis. Therefore, methods which increase water use efficiency (WUE) and reduce water excessive amount of water applied are of importance for conserving water. In this context, deficit irrigation can play an important role in increasing WUE and reduced amount of irrigation. Deficit irrigation is a strategy, which allows a crop to sustain some degree of water deficit during certain stages of crops or the whole season without a significant reduction in yield in order to reduce irrigation. In this study, a series of greenhouse and open field experiments were conducted using a deficit irrigation program on cucumber crops under drip irrigation during (2008–2010) growing seasons. Water was added at 40, 60, 80, 100{\%} of ETc in addition to the traditional methods used by farmers in the region. The objective of the study was to determine the crop response factor (ky) and WUE of cucumber crop using a deficit irrigation program at different stages of growth and through the entire growing season. Results indicated that a cucumber could stand the shortage of water during the growth and crop response (Ky) values ranged between (0.70– 0.98); however, the amount of water used was much lower than that of traditional methods used by farmers in the region.},

abstract = {In the coastal zone of the Ganges Delta, water shortages due to soil salinity limit the yield of dry season crops. To alleviate water shortage as a consequence of salinity stress in the coastal saline ecosystem, the effect of different water-saving (WS) and water-conserving options was assessed on growth, yield and water use of tomato; two field experiments were carried out at Gosaba, West Bengal, India in consecutive seasons during the winter of 2016–17 and 2017–18. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with five treatments viz., surface irrigation, surface irrigation + straw mulching, drip irrigation at 100{\%} reference evapotranspiration (ET0), drip irrigation at 80{\%} ET0, drip irrigation at 80{\%} ET0 + straw mulching. Application of drip irrigation at 80{\%} ET0 + straw mulching brought about significantly the highest fruit as well as the marketable yield of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The soil reaction (pH), post-harvest organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (N, P and K) status and soil microbial population along with the biochemical quality parameters of tomato (juice pH, ascorbic acid, total soluble solids and sugar content of fruits) were significantly influenced by combined application of drip irrigation and straw mulching. Surface irrigation significantly increased the salinity level in surface and sub-surface soil layers while the least salinity development was observed in surface mulched plots receiving irrigation water through drip irrigation. The highest water productivity was also improved from drip irrigation at 80{\%} ET0 + straw mulched plots irrespective of the year of experimentation. Such intervention also helped in reducing salinity stress for the tomato crop. Thus, straw mulching along with drip irrigation at 80{\%} ET0 can be recommended as the most suitable irrigation option for tomato crop in the study area as well as coastal saline regions of South Asia. Finally, it can be concluded that the judicious application of irrigation water not only increased growth, yield and quality tomatoes but also minimized the negative impact of soil salinity on tomatoes grown in the coastal saline ecosystem of Ganges Delta.},
