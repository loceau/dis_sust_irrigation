	abstract = {Irrigation has significant potential to enhance productivity, resilience to climatic risks and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the focus has historically been on large-scale dam-based schemes, farmer-managed small-scale irrigation (SSI) has gained increased attention in recent years. Using data from Ethiopia, Tanzania and Ghana, we first examine patterns of adoption of different SSI technologies. Next, we employ hierarchical modelling to examine which variables are associated with observed adoption patterns and cluster effects that explain variation in irrigation adoption. We document significant cross-country variation in adoption patterns and find a positive association between plot-level use of SSI and the intensity of agricultural labor and inorganic fertilizers applied on the plot. Community-level intra-cluster correlation (ICC) is the highest in Tanzania, where gravity-fed irrigation is most common while farm-level ICC is the highest in Ethiopia where motorized technologies are more common. These results suggest the need for localized investments to ease locale-specific potential constraints. For example, easing possible liquidity constraints to acquiring motorized technologies can be more effective in Ethiopia while the construction of dams and improved conveyance systems, as well as the strengthening of community-based irrigation management (e.g., through Water User Associations (WUAs)) can be more effective in Tanzania. Further research is needed to understand pathways for selected plot-level characteristics that affect use of SSI including status of plot ownership and the gender of the plot manager.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the demand for new and green energy sources continues to increase, freshwater resources are under increasing pressure, prompting the use of nonconventional production alternatives. Greywater can be used for human, agricultural and green purposes; however, it can also be used for environmentally friendly energy generation. Greywater disposed from high-rise buildings (over 100 m in height) is an additional alternative that can be utilized for energy generation and subsequently also for agricultural and/or ornamental irrigation. This manuscript demonstrates options among the many available possibilities for producing energy from free-falling greywater in high-rise buildings (HRBs'). The idea is to install turbines on different levels of the building to generate energy and use it immediately in the building itself. Although the amount of energy produced is limited according to preliminary assessments, extra work is required to improve the recovery systems. The results demonstrated many existing alternatives for turbines locations, referencing to a countless number of storage places and turbine types. The special purpose WaterGEMS simulation software was chosen for the analysis. © 2022},

	abstract = {India is the world’s largest producer of milk for over 20 years. This production mainly responds to growing domestic demand, and relies almost entirely on millions of small herds (3 female buffaloes or cows) fed with local crop residues. This paper aims to assess the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of this dairy development model by implementing different approaches at various geographical scales. To assess such a model is complex. On the one hand, the recycling of biomass for livestock feed is mainly practiced by the poorest farmers, who have a limited access to land, markets and other resources. It sustains their employment and livelihoods, but also their food security since theyconsume part of their milk production. On the other hand, the intensive use of subsidized mineral fertilizers and energy for irrigation to produce crop grains and residues leads to high fossil energy uses and greenhouse gas emissions per litre of milk, calling into question the model’s environmental sustainability. Our results need to be explored further by (i) investigating more case studies to develop a larger picture of the diversity of the Indian dairy sector, and (ii) integrating the different approaches and levels within a larger framework. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This paper describes the results of an RCT impact evaluation of household irrigation pumps in Kenya, where we randomly allocated free pumps to the female head of household via public lotteries. After two years farmers are still making significant use of their pumps and allocating increased time to irrigated agriculture. We find that pumps increase net farm revenue by approximately 13% of the control mean, and pay for themselves within three years. In addition, we find that farmers with irrigation pumps spent less time on off-farm economic activity. Finally, we find that female decisionmaking power increased and domestic violence decreased among treatment households. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Small scale irrigation has multi-dimensional effects on the livelihood development of the rural people in Ethiopia. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the impact of small-scale irrigation on farmers’ livelihood. A stratified random sampling technique was applied to select 96 users and 162 non-user sample respondents. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an econometric model. Binary logit and Endogenous switching regressions model were employed to identify the determinant of small-scale irrigation participation and its impact on farmers’ livelihood respectively. The Binary logit model result indicates that age and age square of the household, own cultivated land, off-farm job participation, extension contact, distance from homestead to a nearly local market, distance from home to the scheme, and having irrigation user neighbor are significant factors affect farmers’ decision to practice irrigation. To capture the impact of irrigation on farmers’ livelihood, the total income of the household was used in the endogenous switching regression model. The model result shows that the positive and significant impact of irrigation schemes had increased users’ total income by 7829 ETB (8.5%), as compared to non-users. This shows how significant the role of a small-scale irrigation scheme in improving the livelihood condition of farmers in the study area. The finding of this study shows that improving access to market and water for irrigation, provision of extension, and other complementary services would increase the participation of irrigation and improve livelihood. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This study examined the impact of rural out-migration on the poverty of migrant-sending households by applying the new economics labor migration theory as a theoretical framework, and the multinomial endogenous switching regression as an analytical model in southern Ethiopia. Data were gathered from 415 sample rural households using stratified random sampling in the year 2021. The cost of basic needs approach and the Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (FGT) method were used to establish the poverty line and create the poverty indices, respectively. The average annual food and non-food poverty lines are Birr 8997.52 and 2249.38 per adult equivalent. The incidence, depth, and severity of general poverty are 39.76, 10.11, and 3.55%, respectively, while the incidence, depth, and severity of food poverty are 34.70, 9.47, and 3.58%, respectively. When compared to other households, households with international migrants have a lower incidence, depth, and severity of poverty. The regression result of the multinomial endogenous switching model showed that international migration increases consumption per adult equivalent of households by 29.8% and is significant at the 1% level. Participation in rural-urban and international migration increases kilocalories per adult equivalent per day by 7.4 and 36.4%, respectively, in migrant-sending rural households. The findings support the new economics labor migration theory’s remittance hypothesis. Promoting access to land, capital, farm and non-farm employment, irrigation, family planning, and basic public services would improve rural household welfare and reduce the current wave of rural out-migration in Southern Ethiopia. © 2023 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a conceptual framework highlighting the transmission mechanisms whereby Internet access may affect irrigation system selection and identify direct effects through agricultural production and an indirect effect through non-agricultural production. To examine the effect of the Internet on irrigation system adoption, we implement the most extensive household survey of irrigation arrangements ever conducted in rural China.

Findings: The authors find evidence to suggest that Internet access can effectively reduce information frictions and searching costs in the non-agricultural labor market, thus increasing rural households' participation in non-farm work. To save more hours from agricultural production, rural households select more labor-saving irrigation systems.

Cross-sectional panel data obtained from cost of cultivation scheme was used for the study. The results illustrated that the total input energies in maize production for the period under study increased from 73.01 thousand MJ ha-1in 2010-11 to 95.03 thousand MJha-1in 2017-18. Energy usage pattern indicated that power and electricity consumed for irrigation were the main energy inputs consumed in maize production in the study region. The farmers were technical inefficiency (0.851) implying that 14.9 per cent of the overall resources in the production process could be saved. The total CO2emission was calculated as 45.17 thousand kg CO2eq ha-1. By energy optimization, the total energy consumption can be reduced to 105.7 thousand MJ ha-1corresponding to total CO2emission reduction potential to value at 5.7 thousand kg CO2eq ha-1. Sustainability of the farm was characterized by positive growth at a low rate of 0.07% per annum and thus, higher efficiency level accompanied by high level of productivity resulted in potential reduction emission level among the farmers. It is, therefore; recommended that government policies should be geared towards practices that tend to improve efficiency and productivity of the farmers through effective extension education. © 2022 Economic Affairs (New Delhi).

Therefore, in this study households’ willingness to pay for sustainable agricultural water supply in case of North West Ethiopia was analyzed from October 2019 to December 2020 using 385 sample households selected through systematic random sampling technique. Double bounded dichotomous choice with follow up of open ended format of contingent valuation method were employed. Seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model was used to analyze determinants of households’ probability of willingness to pay. Accordingly, irrigation experience, livestock holding, respondent being male headed, having access to an irrigation input, and having access to market information have positive whereas, age of respondent, distance to market, owning motor pump, rainfall productivity, first and second bid values have negative but statistically significant effect on households’ probability of WTP for sustainable agricultural water supply. The mean WTP of households’ for improved irrigation water supply was estimated 961.68 and 972.66 birr per year/timad (0.25 ha) from double bounded dichotomous choice and open ended format respectively. The aggregate welfare gain of improved irrigation water supply from double bounded dichotomous choice and open ended format was estimated to be 39,068,250 and 39,514,312.5 birr per year respectively. Based on the findings, it is recommended that enhancing farmers’ awareness about resource scarcity and efficient utilization of scarce resource should be prerequisite for effective implementation of sustainable agricultural water charging schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: This work addresses the increasing prevalence of water scarcity. Droughts are projected to worsen as a result of climate change and urbanization, increasing the need for all sectors to reduce the amount of water used. Home landscape irrigation represents an important opportunity to reduce water use in the United States. Focus of the Article: This formative research study used social marketing techniques to estimate potential impact of irrigation water conservation behaviors, weight and prioritize the behaviors to guide behavior selection in the context of residential irrigation conservation. Research Objective: The objectives were to estimate (1) the potential impact of, (2) current adoption levels and likelihood of adoption of, and to (3) prioritize various landscape irrigation water conservation behaviors. Program Design/Approach: When addressing any issue, including water scarcity, identifying target behaviors is the first, foundational step for a successful social marketing campaign. This research focuses on formative social marketing research to inform local interventions designed to reduce the amount of water applied to residential yards across the United States. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: This study outlines a process to compare and prioritize water conservation behaviors with the goal of reducing residential landscape irrigation usage. We demonstrate a technique for obtaining this type of formative research, the lack of which can serve as a barrier to change agents promoting behaviors in any context. Methods: We employed a two-pronged quantitative survey research approach to collect technical experts’ impact ranking and U.S. residents’ current adoption levels and likelihood of adopting potential irrigation water conservation behaviors. The 14-member expert panel was selected using purposive and snowball sampling techniques, and the residential sample (N = 2601) was recruited using purposive sampling. Results: Mean weights ranged from −46.55 to 61.13. Singly considering impact, current adoption levels, or likelihood of adoption would result in a different behavior receiving priority for a campaign (eliminating irrigated areas in landscapes, installing smart irrigation controllers, and following local watering restrictions, respectively). However, when these values were considered together, installing drought-tolerant plants in the yard had the greatest overall weight. Limitations: A possible conceptual limitation of this case study was the national scope of our research. The findings provide valuable baseline data for behavior change practitioners working across the country, and it is advisable to replicate this process at a local scale corresponding to the targeted intervention. Recommendations for Research or Practice: The findings underscore the importance of including technical experts and target audience members early in social marketing program planning and reveal the importance of systematically approaching behavior change selection to thoroughly consider different components of potential behaviors. Behavior change practitioners working on water issues can use the weights reported here to prioritize behaviors for targeted interventions, and those working in all areas can follow the process to prioritize behaviors at the local level. There are exciting opportunities to decompose likelihood into behavioral antecedents for both research and application. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Firms today are striving to adopt innovations to ensure their survival, value creation and success. Innovation is increasingly seen as an outcome of a collaborative process, involving various stakeholders both within and outside the firms, in supply chain relationships. Collaborative arrangements are gaining traction and the focus of innovation is shifting from firms to their supply chain networks. This leads to the notion of supply chain innovation, which has been widely accepted as an important ingredient for improving the organisational and supply chain performance of firms. Inefficient practices such as improper crop selection, involvement of too many intermediaries, flood irrigation, over-fertilization and food waste necessitate innovative practices that will improve the sustainability of the food supply chain. In this regard, there is a need to investigate how collaboration among food supply chain entities leads to innovative practices and how these innovative practices in turn improve the sustainability of the food supply chain. This study aims to address this gap using the case of the Indian Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs). Further, using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, the supply chain of FPO is divided into five levels - plan, source, make, deliver and return and the case is analysed across these levels. The findings show that the formation of FPO through collaboration facilitates many innovative practices that result in several economic, environmental and social benefits to the FPO. © 2020},

	abstract = {Management of common-pool resources in the absence of individual pricing can lead to suboptimal allocations. High-frequency data from three irrigation schemes in Mozambique reveal patterns consistent with water inefficiency. Farmers use the amount of water required at the most sensitive stage of production as a benchmark for all allocations in the crop cycle. We demonstrate that these rule-of-thumb approaches create scarcity at the plot level despite schemes having sufficient water to meet farmers’ individual demands. We therefore explore the possibility of a feedback tool that visually communicates to farmers the potential to conserve by varying water applications at each stage of the crop cycle. To test the importance of tailoring the information to farmers’ own settings, we randomize a set of farmers to also receive visualizations comparing water requirements with each farmer's water use in the same season of the previous year. The experiment fails to detect an additional effect of individualized comparative feedback relative to a general information treatment. Water measurement shows that the gains from correcting observed misallocations of water in terms of water savings and avoided scarcity is potentially large as a share of water used in the agricultural sector. These findings support additional testing of feedback tools to encourage water conservation but not the expensive investments that would be required to generate feedback based on individual metering for all targeted farmers. © 2021 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.},

Oxen have been looted and killed, farm inputs and tools destroyed by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. Farmers felt vulnerable out in the open with their oxen. To produce, farmers evaluated risks involved with ploughing and organised lookouts. Overall, a large part of the land had been tilled in difficult conditions, and crops sown that require minimal management, without fertiliser, what led to low yields. True Colour Composite images, produced from Sentinel satellite imagery show that smallholder irrigation schemes were operational. There was a shift from commercial crops to cereals. The situation in western Tigray was particular, as there has been ethnic cleansing of the population and often the 2020 rainfed crops had even not been harvested. Overall, our findings show that the Tigrayan smallholder farming system is resilient, thanks to community self-organisation, combining common strategies of agrarian societies in wartime: spatio-temporal shift in agricultural activities to avoid the proximity with soldiers and shifts in crop types. Rather unique is the relying on communal aid, while the blockade of the Tigray region made that outmigration and off-farm income were no options for the farmers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The results from a semiparametric model show that farmers who had food sufficiency to feed the family in the previous year, access to credit, and agriculture micro-irrigation infrastructure adopt more water conservation practices.

Experience-based measures of food security capture the diversity of diets, food shortage, and other aspects of food security, including psychological and behavioral manifestations of insecure food access. In Nigeria, the agricultural sector contributed about 22.35% to the nation's gross domestic product during 2021. In addition, almost 70% of Nigerians engage in farming for subsistence purposes, with climate change and poor irrigation systems affecting their agricultural productivity. Consistent with previous work linking higher agricultural productivity with better welfare outcomes among Nigerian households, we find that an increase in agricultural productivity increases food security as measured by experience-based indicators. Specifically, a 10% growth in agricultural productivity decreases the likelihood of (i) relying on less preferred foods, (ii) limiting the variety of food eaten, and (iii) limiting portion size at mealtimes by 3.7%, 3.9%, and 1.9%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa have placed considerable emphasis on expanding irrigated agriculture. This is in response to the subcontinent's growing population pressure, coupled with production risks associated with declining and variable rainfall. Irrigation is viewed as an important strategy to improve food security and protect rural livelihoods, with small-scale irrigation identified as the preferred strategy. And yet, adoption of irrigation has been slow, and irrigation investments are often underutilized. Expanding irrigated agriculture through increases in cultivated area alone will not be sufficient for greater food security; land and water productivity of irrigated agriculture needs to be increased, and this may in fact help accelerate the adoption of irrigation. Shared irrigation investments among small farmers are going to be challenging to sustain as smallholder households diversify their livelihoods, and do not cultivate field crops every season. For individual irrigation technologies, many barriers exist in their adoption, especially the risks and ambiguities such as pestilence and borehole installation failures; and governments will have to invest significantly more than they currently do in research and extension efforts to ease these barriers. Finally, the expansion of irrigation, especially individual irrigation, will likely create environmental challenges such as aquifer depletion, water pollution, and soil degradation, which governments would also have to manage by coordinating the actions of individual smallholders. This paper identifies the kind of institutional infrastructure and policy support that African agriculture will need to have in place to expand irrigation beyond its current status.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {During the water crisis of 2015–2016, the construction of small earth-filled dams grew to supply irrigated crops of the north of Espírito Santo-ES, Brazil. This paper reports the hydrogeochemical study of eight reservoirs conducted between 10/2016 to 11/2017 to assess the water suitability for agricultural purposes and its risk to irrigation systems. The reservoirs of São Mateus (SM) are located in large drainage basins with many impoundments upstream. Nova Venecia's reservoirs (NV) have small and circular drainage areas with few, or any, upstream dams. The results are consistent with freshwater classification and Na-Cl composition to all reservoirs. Nevertheless, canonical discriminant analysis and Spearman's coefficients revealed distinct composition and patterns of correlations between municipalities. The mean permeability index of 53 and the low risk of sodicity and salinization (C1S1) demonstrate that these waters' use is harmless to the soil and crops. However, the phosphate contents make the new reservoirs susceptible to algae blooms. The same reservoirs also presented total solids and Fe levels above the tolerable limit for safety irrigation use, imposing a severe risk of clogging. The low replenishment of SM's reservoirs reflects the dispute over water resulting from the high number of impoundments in these drainage areas. The drought that preceded the study diminished the drainage basins' vegetation cover, favoring soil particles' runoff, elevating the TS and Fe levels, especially in the recently built reservoirs. Farmers must control soil erosion to avoid water quality compromise, to reduce the risk of failure and the irrigation system's maintenance cost. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Minimum and ideal environmental flow regimes were embedded in the structure of the reservoir operation model to optimize the environmental flow needs and water supply and assess their tradeoffs. Cropping pattern optimization was used to maximize farmer profit. Particle swarm optimization was applied in the optimization processes. The method was applied to a case study in the Tajan River basin, Iran, with the results showing the environmental flow regime considerably reduces irrigation supply and has significant impacts on farmer profits. The results showed that cropping pattern optimization was not an effective strategy to mitigate the economic impacts of climate change under environmental flow constraints, but this assessment may not be generalized to other areas.

To carry out the aforesaid study, we have conducted a field survey in Assam, India. Using ordered probit regression, we find that vulnerability is determined by a host of factors such as age, family size, social group, monthly expenditure, loss due to crop damage, coping measures, crop insurance, use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation. However, access to institutional support does not reduce vulnerability significantly. Coping measures are mostly destructive, and farmers with these coping strategies are more vulnerable to poverty. Social safety nets such as public distribution and ad hoc employment facilities are available, but the safety nets needed for farming and basic measures required for increasing productivity have been lacking. The study recommends affordable irrigation, training and awareness programmes and the provision of the resource base for successful coping. It is also important to provide opportunities for livelihood diversification to maintain the inflow of cash during crop loss. Finally, farmers who are on the margins of subsistence require institutions for social security to reduce vulnerability and bring about transformation. JEL Classification: C83 © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Sustainability assessing on agricultural production systems has developed rapidly over the last two decades, and various models are formulated from different perspectives. However, a comprehensive evaluation model that involved both efficiency of system output and environmental impact has not yet been fully explored. Here, we combined the emergy method with life cycle assessment to construct a coupled model for sustainability evaluation, taking an intensive winter wheat–summer maize cropping system in Huantai County, China, as a case study, which was examined before and after the Project of Soil Testing and Fertilizer Recommendation (PSTFR). Our results showed that compared with 1996, the sustainability index (SI) of this cropping system in 2012 increased by 50.37%, indicating that the sustainability of the target system was further enhanced. The emergy yield ratio (EYR) increased by 21.8% in 2012, while the potential damage to human health (HH) and the potential damage to ecosystem health (ESH) in 2012 were lower than those in 1996, by 22.38% and 15.17%, respectively; and the environmental impact index (EII) decreased by 19.00%. Though there was a remarkable improvement in the SI, the proportion of irrigation water in total emergy input was still as high as 46.0%, followed by nitrogen fertilizer, accounting for 23.60%. According to the coupled model, reducing irrigation water and electricity consumption, and reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer, could contribute the most to further improvements in sustainability. Furthermore, this novel coupled model has high potential to measure sustainability of an agro-system, while needs further improvement and modification in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The Colorado River is a river system spanning seven states in the United States (US) and two in Mexico. Water in the river has been over-allocated, which has led the Colorado River Delta in Mexico to dry up, thus endangering the indigenous species. The two nations made several temporary, costly allocation agreements to transfer water to the Delta for ecological restoration. However, there is still no long-term economic solution for the Delta, which is what this study aims to address. In this work, I investigate solutions for rerouting water to the Delta that will minimize costs without causing excessive damage to the agrarian economy in the US. The cost of conserving water for the Delta was analyzed using numerical simulations with crop data from the Imperial Irrigation District in California. The objective is to find a policy that would help allocate 100,000 acre-feet per year to the Colorado River Delta at a minimum lifetime cost. Two scenarios are studied that would yield enough water for a sustainable restoration of the ecosystem: fallowing croplands and changing the irrigation system to be more water-efficient. Results indicate that fallowing 20,000 ac of alfalfa would be the least costly way of accumulating this resource at a cost ranging from $5.5 million to $13 million per year for a 31-year time horizon.

The results indicate that few smallholders have adopted the new crops; those that have adopted the crops only plant small shares of their land with the new crops, and that there has been only a small increase in adoption over the 10-year period. Furthermore, we found that high population density is positively associated with the adoption of improved wheat, and previous period’s rainfall is positively associated with the adoption of drought-tolerant teff. The adoption of cash crops is positively associated with landholding size and access to irrigation. The policy implications of these results are that the government should increase the improved wheat diffusion efforts in less dense population areas, make sure that drought-tolerant teff seed is available and affordable after droughts, and promote irrigation infrastructure for production of cash crops. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The importance of healthy diets is woven into the fabric of the Sustainable Development Goals, although there is no clear metric to define it. Employing a simulation model (MAGNET), this study examines the sustainability implications arising from the adoption of recommended daily nutrition requirements inspired by the ‘Lancet’ reference diet. To measure sustainability, changes in ‘virtual’ requirements and associated tier footprints for irrigation (blue) water, agricultural land and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are calculated. Assuming business-as-usual food consumption trends, between 2015 and 2050 blue water, agricultural land and emissions rise 34%, 9% and 44%, respectively, whilst corresponding increases in Sub-Saharan Africa are much higher. By 2050, the switch to the reference diet decreases agricultural land use by -8% and emissions by -9%. Global blue water and cropland requirements increase by 5%, whilst significant concomitant savings in permanent pastureland (-21%) are expected. By region, the diet switch drives rising blue water consumption in Oceania and the EU and agricultural land savings in Latin America and Oceania, accompanied by cropland increases in the EU and North Africa. The reference diet generates substantial reductions in GHG emissions, particularly in Latin America. Interestingly, Sub-Saharan Africa which abstains from the reference diet due to affordability considerations, benefits from a ‘rebound’ effect from falling meat and dairy prices. Finally, the diet shift could result in marginal per capita food expenditure rises arising from demand driven fish price, particularly in more vulnerable world regions. This estimate does not capture, however, second-round economic growth effects arising from increased labour productivity and reduced public health expenditures. © 2021},

	abstract = {Insect pollination improves the yield of most crop species and contributes to one-third of global crop production. The importance of this ecosystem service in improving agricultural production has largely been overlooked, however, in favour of practices that improve soil conditions such as fertiliser use and supplementary irrigation. Using economic modelling, this study estimates the value of insect pollination under different land-use types in Kenya. Our model assumes that a combination of land-use type and the foraging distance of insect pollinators influences the intensity of pollination and the value of agricultural output. To demonstrate the hypothesised relationships, areas under different land-use types, e.g. forest, grassland and cropland, and their distances from households were used as proxies for insect pollination. Concentric buffer zones representing foraging distances of pollinators from the land-use types were drawn at 250 m, 500 m, 1 000 m, 2 000 m and 3 000 m from the farms, and areas under each land use in the buffer zones were estimated for the years 2004, 2007 and 2010. Using the random-effects model and an output distance-function stochastic frontier model, the land-use areas, other factors of production and climate variables were regressed on the value of agricultural output in each buffer zone to determine their contribution to agricultural output resulting from insect pollination. The results indicate higher crop productivity on farms bordering forests and grasslands. This implies that insect pollinators are important for crop production, and increasing the number of pollinator habitats closer to the farms will increase food production in the tropics. © 2022,Agricultural and Resource Economics.

	abstract = {The functioning of Uzbekistan’s economy is closely linked to the water resources of its huge cross-border rivers: the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, as well as to the groundwater present within their basins. Both natural lakes and artificial reservoirs (e.g. the Aydar-Arnasay system of lakes, the Kayrakkum Reservoir, the Chardarya Reservoir) are present there, which retain significant amounts of water, and large canals with lengths of up to several hundred kilometres which involve complex hydraulic structures are used for irrigation purposes. All these are components of a water management system which needs optimisation; as much as 80% of agricultural land is irrigated, with 70% of the water being lost due to inefficient irrigation systems. The consequence of this allocation of river flows and the overuse of water in irrigation systems has been the disappearance of the Aral Sea (1960 year – 68,900 km2, 2017 year – 8,600 km2) and the inflow of water into the Sarygamysh Lake as well as the reduction of Uzbekistan’s groundwater resources by about 40%. The intensive development of irrigated agriculture is associated with changes in surface and groundwater quality caused, inter alia, by the increased use of chemicals in agriculture and the discharge of collector-drainage waters into river systems as well as their reuse. The extent of environmental degradation in some areas (especially in the Aral Sea region) is unique on a global scale. The origins of Uzbekistan’s other hydrological tourist attractions are related to attempts to ensure the availability of water for both human consumption and industrial use under conditions of water scarcity in the country’s arid and semi-arid climates. Not just the spectacular watercourses and water bodies present there (e.g. rivers, lakes, canals), but also small water retention facilities and minor infrastructure elements (e.g. wells, springs and retention basins, canals, ditches and flow control structures) are of potential tourist importance. © 2021, ASERS Publishing House.

	abstract = {This study examines a green building retrofit plan through a system dynamics model (SDM) creating symbiosis embedded in a building-scale food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. An indicator approach was employed to exploit cross-domain seams via the use of carbon, water, and ecological footprints for sustainability, as well as food security and energy supply reliability ratio for resilience. The SDM was formulated to demonstrate a continuous stormwater treatment outflow model for rooftop farming with stormwater reuse for irrigation, nutrient cycling via the use of green sorption media, and green energy harvesting in support of rooftop farming. We prove that green energy use, stormwater reuse, and rooftop farming can lower carbon, water, and ecological footprints, avoid CO2 emissions via carbon sequestration in rooftop farming, and improve energy supply reliability and food security. Case 1 (Base Case) includes no retrofit (current condition), Case 2 includes rooftop farming and stormwater reuse, and Case 3 incorporates additional green energy harvesting for sustaining rooftop farming. All three scenarios were assessed using a life cycle assessment (LCA) to generate water and carbon footprints. Case 3 exhibited a 2.24% reduction of total building energy demand from the utility grid due to renewable energy harvesting, while the preservation of nitrogen and phosphorus via the use of green sorption media for crop growth promoted nutrient cycling by maintaining 82% of nitrogen and 42% of phosphorus on site. The ecological footprints for the three case studies were 0.134 ha, 0.542 ha, 6.50 ha, respectively. Case 3 was selected as the best green building retrofit option through a multicriteria decision analysis. © 2021},

We employ propensity score matching and W. Greene's selection bias-corrected stochastic production frontier methods to correct for observable and unobservable selection bias issues, respectively. We further use a metafrontier model to derive technology gap ratios (TGRs) and meta-TE for agrifood system participants and nonparticipants. The results reveal that agrifood system participants are about 50% more productive than nonparticipants. In addition, participants have higher meta-TE (58% vs. 55%) and TGR (98% vs. 94%) than nonparticipants. Variables such as farmer group membership, extension visits, mobile phone ownership, irrigation and road access are the notable correlates of smallholder farmers' participation in agrifood systems. The total value of vegetable production is significantly influenced by fertilizer, agrochemicals, seeds, irrigation, soil fertility, and location-fixed effects. [EconLit Citations: D24, Q12, Q18]. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The management of large-scale water resources systems requires including of different stakeholders and users from municipal, agricultural, industrial and environmental sectors. This has baffled the process of decision making for integrated water resource systems. In such systems, the interactions between various stakeholders must be carefully taken into account with the goal of aggregating interests around the sustainability concept. In this study, first, the integrated water resources systems of Big Karun Watershed, Iran, have been modeled using the system dynamics approach. The system dynamics model represents the interactions between different components of the system, including water transfer projects, dams, urban, industry, agriculture and fish farming, and environmental demands. Vensim software has been used for the system dynamics modeling. Vensim simulates the dynamics behavior of the sub-systems and overall performance of the system by comparing the current operation policies with the future management scenarios. A wide range of performance indices, such as quantitative and qualitative water stress, income, cost, and productivity, have been used here to represent different aspects of sustainability goals. Finally, the performance of the systems has been evaluated by developing a sustainability index using distributed zoning model in order to identify proper management policies for this watershed. The results indicate that downstream users demand cannot be fully met by solely considering inter-basin water transfer and agricultural development projects. The sustainable and integrated management of the whole system ties into enhancement in both infrastructure systems and the operation of the whole system. It is expected that the sustainability of the basin improves if a water market schema exists and the gained money would be used to enhance the efficiency of existing irrigation networks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

So far, to our best knowledge, no study has applied the SLF to examine the influence of land quality on land use intensively. The current research examines the effects of land quality on farmers’ decision-making on land use in Vietnam by modifying the sustainable livelihoods framework and using the fixed effects regression model. The method controlled the household and commune-level unobserved invariant characteristics and resulted in more robust estimates than pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation. The sample is a five-wave panel dataset of 2008-2016 with 1,534 farm households. The results reveal that land quality affects land-use choices through several aspects of land quality. More specifically, regarding topography, plot fertility level, plot locations, and soil and water conservation, results show that their effects reflect the cultivating practices for each land-use type in the sample. Findings also show that the irrigation system positively affects rice production in Vietnam. Policymakers should consider various aspects of land quality when designing policies and programs relating to land use, irrigation distribution, and especially the master plan for agricultural production and rural development. Flexible guidance for land uses of each type is closely connected with land quality in each region that may be most suitable for sustainable agriculture development. © 2022,International Journal of Economics and Finance Studies.

	abstract = {Water pollution is the most important factor affecting the environment. Appropriate monitoring is a big challenge to make sustainable growth by maintaining it for society. In recent times, water monitoring has turned into a smart monitoring system for water pollution (SMS-wp), with the advances on the Internet of things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and the improvement in current sensors. River Ganga is one of the major sources of water for drinking, irrigation, and industries in the northern part of India. Day by day, Ganga River is getting polluted, due to anthropogenic activities, such as the construction of dams, extensive use of fertilizers in agriculture, and untreated discharges from industries. Contamination in the river water is adversely affecting human health and river biota. Therefore, to improve the river ecosystem and to check infections and diseases, water quality assessment is very much important. The main aim of this study is to determine the Water Quality Index (WQI) of the River Ganges at the upper part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, just downstream of the Himalayan foothill using the last 3 years of data (2017–2019). Trend analysis for River Ganga water at considered locations is also a part of this study. Trend analysis is presenting the water quality of river Ganga in the coming years up to 2025. Twelve physicochemical parameters (TDS, chlorides, alkalinity, DO, temperature, COD, BOD, pH, magnesium, hardness, total coliform, and calcium) were analyzed to determine the water quality of River Ganga. As a result, WQI for next 5 years (from 2020 to 2025) is forecasted as an increment of 17.34% at Haridwar, 4.16% at Roorkee, and 21.63% at Dehradun. Results of the study indicated that WQI values just downstream of the Himalayan foothills in the upper reaches of the Gangetic plain are increasing every year. The authors have concentrated on how the advances in sensor innovation, the Internet of things, and machine learning techniques make water pollution monitoring a genuinely brilliant checking framework. Finally, the system of robust strategies for ML, denoising techniques, and advancement of appropriate guidelines for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been recommended. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

We identify five dimensions of task difficulty that affect the degree and nature of policy challenges and, as a result, the institutional capacities necessary to accomplish such challenges.

This framework constitutes a diagnostic tool for identifying areas in need of institutional strengthening, emphasizing the importance of “fit” between institutional capacities and developmental tasks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This article examines the case of four countries—India, China, western United States, and Israel—where there is a long history of irrigated agriculture with significant public and private investments, to identify key themes for managing irrigation under increasing physical and economic water scarcity. The focus of irrigation management has expanded from investing in irrigation infrastructure to reforming institutions; strengthening policies pertaining to irrigation prices and rights; using incentives to reward reductions in irrigation application; and improving irrigation efficiency. However, this may not be sufficient to reduce consumptive use of water in agriculture. Reducing freshwater use in agriculture will require cost-effective harnessing of other water sources through processes such as desalination and wastewater reuse, which may be difficult to implement in most geographies. Changes to policies in other sectors will likely be needed, especially in food procurement and land-use, which require balancing water security with food security, and supporting potential losses in livelihoods and incomes from such changes. Finally, reductions in agricultural water use in a country will likely have implications for water use in other countries, through imports. © 2022 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In this regard, the objective of this paper is to investigate the risk facing rice farmers and the impact of risk mitigation strategies on profit of the farmers in the Mekong Delta. The results, estimated from a sample of 342 farmers, show that 80 percent of the farmers faced two types of risk, namely weather risk, risk of crop pests and diseases. Mitigation strategies of the farmers are (1) adjusting planting schedules and growing techniques, (2) water resource management, (3) rice protection products, and (4) reducing production scale. The results of regression analysis showed that the first and second strategy are found to be positively correlated with farmer's profit. It is also revealed that farmers who actively respond to risks have higher profit than passive farmers, consistent with a common perception of "prevention is better than cure". The policy implication to be drawn from the study for the government and the MRD agricultural sector is to guide farmers in risk identification and prevention. At the same time, it is necessary to invest in upgrading the risk forecasting system in agriculture and to invest in completing irrigation infrastructure allowing actively regulate water for production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Spatially distributed potential and net recharge rates were assessed in the paddy dominated Hirakud command area (Eastern India) at 100 m grid resolution using surface water balance and Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) methods, respectively, for the period 2001–05. Net recharge estimated using the WTF method corresponding to observation well locations was further interpolated using kriging technique available in the ArcGIS software. Net recharge to potential recharge ratios (%) were also assessed spatially. Water balance components (i) runoff was estimated using the Natural Resources Conservation Service-Curve Number (NRCS-CN) method (ii) reference evapotranspiration by (Hargreaves and Samani, Applied Engineering Agriculture ASABE 1:96–99, 1985)), crop evapotranspiration by (Allen et al., Crop evapotranspiration: Guidelines for computing crop water requirements, FAO Irrigation and Drainage, Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy, 1998) and evaporation from uncultivated lands by Ritchie (1972) approaches, and (iii) canal seepage using simple canal flow model. Annual groundwater draft during Kharif and Rabi was found to be 144.41 and 112.49 ha-m, respectively. Nearly, 90% of the study area contributed runoff in the range of 200–400 mm during the years 2002–03, 2003–04, and 2004–05. The estimated seepage losses vary between 5 and 15% of irrigation depth for all distributaries. Potential groundwater recharge during wet, normal, and dry years ranges between 650 and 1033 mm, and equivalent to 67%, 78%, and 60% of annual rainfall, respectively. Net recharge ranges between 8 and 11% of the annual rainfall. Mean ratio between net recharge to potential recharge is nearly 30%, indicating that nearly 70% of potential recharge is accounted as outflow from the study area. Parmanpur distributary canal located at the centre of the study area that exhibited higher potential recharge can be scheduled at the end to avoid water logging problem. Further, extraction of groundwater during non-monsoon period for irrigation purpose not only helps in controlling waterlogging but also helps in maintaining stable groundwater level. Overall, spatio-temporal distribution of recharge in the command area indicated that the irrigation demands during non-monsoon season can be met through sustainable management of underexploited groundwater resources. Such an integrated management of surface and groundwater can help in improving water use efficiencies as well as agricultural productivity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Paddy rice cultivation is an important source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in China. The traditional flooded paddy rice fields not only use large amounts of irrigation water, but also produce significant methane (CH4) emissions. To balance food security with environmental impacts of rice production, many water-saving irrigations technologies have been tested in the field to increase the drainage period during the rice growth cycle. However, whether these management solutions can be implemented at the regional scale needs to be further explored. Because it is too time-consuming and resource-intensive for field experiments to be carried out across large areas, we opt to assess the regional impacts of alternative irrigation schemes via computer modeling, by coupling the well-known DSSAT and DNDC models, which have been extensively validated in China. Irrigation methods tested include the traditional Continuous Flooding (CF), Midseason Drainage (MD) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). Simulation results show that compared with CF, water-saving irrigation methods can significantly reduce the CH4 emission from paddy rice field, with slight or no loss in expected rice yields. AWD had the greatest effect in reducing irrigation water amounts and CH4 emission. Compared with CF, CH4 emission under the AWD were 60% - 71% lower in Northeast China sites and 34% - 65% lower in South China sites. At the same time, compared to CF, irrigation water use in AWD was reduced by 23% - 34% in northeast China sites and by 18% - 50% in south China sites. Our results suggest that policies that support expansion of AWD in paddy rice cultivation across China can lead to a “win-win” for the food-water-GHG emissions tradeoffs, and offer a viable solution for policy makers and stakeholders in China. © 2020},

The study utilized primary data collected from randomly selected samples of 200 members of sugarcane-producing farmers’ cooperatives through a structured survey questionnaire. Purposively selected ten KIIs and six FGDs were also conducted with contract farmers and stakeholders. The five-point Likert scale measurement was created and applied to measure the perception of respondents about the scheme on considered 26 attributes and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of ‘2.32ʹ with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study develops a novel integrated modelling framework for sustainable agricultural energy-water-food nexus (EWFN) management, with the objectives of maximum social welfare of water resources allocation, maximum hydroelectric generation, maximum grain crop production, maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value, and minimum negative farmland ecosystem service value. The proposed framework is capable of: (1) balancing benefit efficiency and allocation equity using social welfare function; (2) reconciling conflicting targets among socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental spheres; (3) generating sustainable water and land resources allocation strategies considering complex and uncertain environment. The proposed model was applied to the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area, central China. Flexible water and land resources allocation schemes among different sectors, crops, and periods were generated, as well as managerial insights into what efforts should be done were provided for decision-makers. After optimization, efficiency-equity tradeoff was balanced with social welfare index reaching [0.94, 0.99]. Optima results show that GHGs emission contributed majority of the total loss, which cannot be totally neutralized by carbon sequestration, causing negative eco-environmental impacts of [2.3, 3.4] × 108 CNY. The proposed model performs well on generating robust and coordinated solutions according to scenarios analysis and models comparison. The proposed approach has potential on achieving SDGs in agricultural EWFN system, and is portable to other agriculture-centered areas suffering from similar resources crisis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the determinants of concurrent adoption of farm risk management strategies by rice growers in two different ecosystems of Telangana agriculture-irrigated and rainfed ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data have been collected from the rice growers in two different ecosystems, and after checking the variance inflation factor (VIF) for controlling multicollinearity, a multinomial logit model has been used to examine the determinants of concurrent adoption of coping strategies by rice growers. Findings: The study finds that adopting one risk management strategy persuades farmers to embrace other strategies, reducing the risk in agriculture between the two ecosystems. Among the determinants, farmers' age, education, contact with extension services, irrigation sources, livestock income, total farm income, crop loss reasons, and crop insurance awareness significantly influence the adoption of various risk management measures. However, considerable heterogeneity is found among the driving forces across the rice ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: The major policy implications that can be drawn from the analysis are increased access to information through government-funded extension services and the provision of alternative risk management technologies, such as drought-resistant or flood-resistant seeds, farmers' field schools and increased provision of crop insurance, farmer-friendly agriculture extension services, and farm investment support, are critical for assisting farmers managing risks. In addition, however, there should be ecosystem-specific policies to tackle the ecosystem heterogeneity. Originality/value: This paper is very timely and entails some relevant policy implications for the development of Indian agriculture. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we took Gansu Province, a key area for poverty alleviation in China, as an example. With the multidimensional comprehensive measurement model of poverty, multi-criteria decision analysis method and ArcGIS spatial analysis method, we explored the poverty-reducing factors of each evaluation unit and classified the poverty type. Results: (1) The evaluation unit of 60.49% in Gansu Province is at the median level of poverty and below, and the phenomenon of extreme poverty is rare. Multidimensional poverty index presents a pattern of “high at both ends, and low in the middle” in space. (2) The proportion of highway entrances and exits, the proportion of rural water-saving irrigation area, the number of health staff in institutions per 1000 people, the number of beds in health institutions per 1,000 people, the water supply per capita water conservancy project, and the number of full-time secondary school teachers per thousand people are the main poverty factors. (3) Poverty in Gansu Province is mainly dominated by single factor and associated with dual-factor, which account for 54.32% of all evaluation units. (4) Economic poverty (income poverty) is relatively poor. It is a result of multi-dimensional poverty. This research can provide guidance and support to facilitate the precise targeting and policy implementation of poverty alleviation targets, and also provide a reference basis for the improvement of the national poverty reduction strategy and the study of poverty geography-related issues. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

The mean monthly water flow rate from the pump was predicted for different months using expected power for 16S × 1P PV array configuration. The mean monthly expected power from solar PV system was estimated using climate change forecast of solar radiation and temperature for 30 years of lifetime period of solar PV pumping system. The estimation of expected power at predicted solar radiation and temperature also includes the yearly system components degradation rate. The water flow rates were predicted using an experimentally developed mathematical model for a given pump. The experimental model simulates the water flow rate for various solar power and heads (30 m, 40 m and 50 m). The field data were obtained using a pumping test facility located at a farm site of IIT Kharagpur (India). It was found that the flow rate increases with the increase in pump power for each head. The yearly pattern of predicted energy and flow rate for different months showed a decreasing trend as the projected temperature rise and component degradation reduces the energy yield from the PV array. The results indicated that the overall reduction in the capacity of a PV system is in the range of 25–27% for different months in which climate change (rise in temperature) showed minor effect (3%) and can be neglected. The mitigating measures for energy loss are required to fulfil future irrigation demand. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Crop spatial pattern should be adjusted in accordance with the agricultural environment factors and climate change so that we make full use of agricultural resources to produce more food. However, crop suitability has not been adequately considered in crop patterns, ignoring the fact that the fundamental solution to agricultural water scarcity is to promote crop water productivity (CWP). This study aims to reallocate crop spatial patterns while synergistically improving irrigation benefits and water productivity. To achieve this, we developed a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model based on ecological movement processes to simulate crop suitability distribution and thus determine crop spatial patterns. The results show that the adjusted crop pattern could increase the regional water productivity by 1.35 times and the net benefits of unit water by 0.94%, and maintained crop yields. Under future climate scenarios, this approach can still ensure irrigation benefits and food security. Therefore, the MCR model provides effective crop patterns and solutions for sustainable agricultural development when facing a complex agricultural environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The unsustainable use of irrigation water is one of the most serious environmental problems in coffee farming. Rapid expansion of sustainability certifications and adoption of advanced irrigation technologies are expected to promote more sustainable water use through changes in water management practices in coffee farming. However, there lacks empirical evidence on the effects of those certification schemes on water efficiency. This study examines the effect of sustainability certification on the water efficiency of coffee growers, considering distinct irrigation technologies used by farmers - overhead sprinkler and micro-basin irrigation technologies. The meta-frontier framework is used in our empirical analysis of 896 Vietnamese coffee farms over three crop years. Results confirm that irrigation water efficiency in coffee farming is substantially low. There is no evidence supporting the effect of sustainability certification on water efficiency, but advanced irrigation technologies could improve water efficiency. Coffee farms using the sprinkler system are more efficient than those using the micro-basin irrigation technology. Our results also support environmentally friendly farming practices, i.e., having wind-break trees on coffee farms. It also suggests that improving the quality of sustainability certification schemes towards sustainable use of water requires water-saving technologies. © 2022},

	abstract = {Investments to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation systems as well as price subsidies to incentivize adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies are promoted to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability of on-farm water use across India. We examine the effect of these two policies on farmer irrigation choices in surface irrigated farms in Madhya Pradesh. A logistic regression based on novel survey data from 918 farmers estimates a 3% reduction in the probability that farmers will adopt drip or sprinkler technologies if they are located on farms serviced by irrigation schemes where 30% or more of the irrigated area was rehabilitated. Results also reveal that, on average, farmers are 12% more likely to continue using irrigation technologies if they had adopted them prior to the start of rehabilitation works. Quantitative results are complemented with semi-structured interviews of farmers to better understand drivers of adoption, which suggest that: (1) open, gravity canals do not always restrict drip or sprinkler adoption, (2) water scarcity appears to be a strong driver for farmers to adopt, despite financial constraints, (3) socio-economic factors such as caste, education, and house ownership does not seem to influence a farmers' choice of adoption, and (4) social networks provide a stronger incentive for adoption as smallholders struggle to access government subsidies. Understanding the role of social networks in influencing the irrigation practices of farmers can complement supply-side infrastructure investments and financial incentive policies to enhance the water security of smallholders facing climatic risks to food production.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Climate change affects crop production through exposure to droughts, floods, pests, and pathogens. To mitigate climate-induced production losses, various stress-tolerant varieties have been developed and adopted in many countries around the globe. We assess the impacts of adopting submergence-tolerant (Sub1) rice varieties on productivity, profit, and rice consumption in northwest Bangladesh, using Endogenous Switching Regression and cross-sectional data in 2016. The findings reveal that the adoption of Sub1 rice had a significant positive impact on yield (6.0% higher), profit (55.0% higher), and rice consumption (15.0% higher) vis-à-vis the impact on non-adopters. Importantly, non-adopters could benefit if they adopted Sub1 rice—with about 8%, 48%, and 15% more rice yield, profit, and rice consumption, respectively. The findings further reveal that approximately 42% of the sampled farmers adopted Sub1 rice in northwest Bangladesh. The main drivers of this adoption are access to information on Sub1 rice through neighbors, farmer organizations, and training. Also, the application of pesticides and irrigation negatively affected the adoption of Sub1 rice. Finally, we find that rice production, profit, and rice consumption are location dependent. Therefore, we suggest implementing location-specific policies and developing social and institutional capacity to build trust in the new technology, which will increase the dissemination of Sub1 seeds by transferring agricultural knowledge and incentivizing farmers to adopt Sub1 rice in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The interest in promoting food and water security through development projects has led to the need to evaluate the impact of these projects. This study evaluates the impact from transitioning to a modern irrigation technology. Deciding to adopt or not an alternative irrigation technology (sprinklers) is not necessarily a random determination. Therefore, selection bias can be present and this can lead to biased estimates. In this study, we apply methodological specifications to correct for self-selectivity biases. Then, we measure and compare the technical efficiency scores from adopters and non-adopters. The empirical application uses data covering 56 small-scale greenhouse farms in Crete (Greece) for the cropping years 2009-2013. The results reveal that the average technical efficiency for farmers who adopted sprinkler irrigation is lower than the group of non-adopters, when the presence of selectivity bias cannot be rejected. This implies that either the farmers need more time to incorporate the know-how of the newly acquired technology or they become less motivated after the adoption. Consequently, agricultural water saving technologies need to be promoted in combination with support to the farmers, so they can cope with the lower performance in the first years after adoption. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Bioenergy plays a pivotal role in replacing fossil fuels, limiting carbon emissions, and supporting the transformation of low-carbon societies. However, bioenergy crop production requires irrigation and the presence of specific soil and weather conditions, resulting in certain environmental impacts due to uneven resource allocation and depletion. Nexus repercussions occur when activities in an individual sector are mismanaged and impact other nexus sectors. This study applies a quantitative nexus approach to quantify, clarify, manage, and mitigate the repercussions and interlinkages between the water, energy, and land sectors. An assessment process is established to locate cultivable idle land, evaluate water availability, and estimate additional energy consumption. Districts are categorized into three groups based on their bioethanol capacity and water availability and are assigned development priorities. Undesirably, many districts that possess the most extensive suitable idle land are projected to face water challenges, so nexus repercussion analysis is applied to develop mitigation strategies, restrain intersystem impact dissemination effects, and sufficiently utilize their capacities. The range of expected mitigation achievement points for these districts varies from 8 million m3 to 66 million m3. Some districts can reach positive water availability and achieve a mitigation ratio higher than 50%. Districts are able to eliminate nexus repercussions from energy consumption and effectively reduce the pressures of water shortages. This study can help policymakers comprehend the limitations of regional water-energy interdependency networks (WEINs) and help them govern nexus repercussions at a manageable level, avoid runaway dissemination occurrences, and strengthen the resilience of WEINs. © 2021},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings: The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location). Practical implications: The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives. Originality/value: Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Drought has become a dominant climate risk both around the world and in Europe, adding to the already challenging task of farming and governing the agricultural sector under climate change. Drought risk management is extremely complex. Apart from irrigation, most drought risk management options have more than one goal and may potentially have negative trade-offs with other risk management objectives. Moreover, government regulations and market mechanisms influence farmers’ decision-making. However, previous studies, both in developed and in developing countries, have predominantly focused on attitudinal and structural influencing factors on farmers’ risk management behavior. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate farmers’ decision spaces with respect to drought risk management. We address two applied research questions: (1) What are farmers’ preferred drought risk management measures? (2) From a farmer’s perspective, what are the dominant factors influencing drought risk management decisions? We find that farmers primarily think of production-based rather than financial measures with respect to drought risk management. At the same time, natural and technical constraints and enabling factors dominate their mental decision space, followed by public and private institutional aspects. This research provides a basis for the design of integrated and holistic drought risk management policy and the drought risk governance needed for sustainable use of land and water resources such as needed to address systemic risks and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach using mental models extracted from interviews to explore cognitive representations of farmers' decision spaces. This approach has the potential to complement mainstream research using standardized surveys and behavioral models to analyze drivers of risk management. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In recent decades millions living in low-income countries like Tajikistan have migrated to support their livelihoods. This massive, predominantly male, out-migration has transformed the agricultural sector. On the one hand, household members with migrants who stay behind, usually female and children, might replace migrant member's previous tasks, leading to the feminization of agriculture. On the other hand, remittances can increase migrant households’ income leading to a reduction in their work and increase in their food security as their purchasing power strengthens. We study the relationship between migration, food insecurity and gender labor division for two production systems in Tajikistan. Using propensity score matching with village fixed effects, we find non-migrant households are associated with having more months of food shortages and spending more days without eating food. In terms of the division of labor, women in migrant households were associated with being more involved in labor-intensive activities. Our results provide evidence that while migration is correlated with greater food security, the demand on women's time and labour increases. This has important implications for designing gender-inclusive agricultural and irrigation training and extension programs, which are usually targeted at males. Gender-sensitive design will be vital for improving countries like Tajikistan's food security, malnutrition, and water resource management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Low agricultural productivity is a major challenge constraining food production in developing countries. Attempts at addressing the problem have resulted in the development and deployment of agricultural technologies, such as organic farming, to help boost productivity, enhance farmers’ income, and their overall livelihood conditions. The deployment of such productivity-enhancing technologies has mostly overlooked their inexplicable interconnectedness and interdependencies with nexus factors such as climate, water, and energy within the embeddings of a food production system. Through a Nigerian case study approach, this study attempts to bridge this gap by qualitatively investigating how organic leafy vegetable production (OLVP) and its anticipated outcomes can be affected by the interface of water, energy, and climate with food production. This was intended to generate exploratory insights that will help underscore why cross-sectoral linkages should be accounted for when deploying agricultural technology interventions. To achieve this objective, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, and field visits to the farms of organic farmers in Ajibode, Ibadan, Nigeria. Results indicate that the productivity of OLVP was severely constrained by highly contextual nexus factors such as energy deficit, the water source for irrigation, changes in rainfall patterns, and temperature effect of harmattan. We concluded that location-specific nexus elements that intersect with food production should be accounted for when introducing productivity-enhancing technologies. Otherwise, the opportunity for improved agricultural productivity may remain elusive. Finally, our study shows that the nexus approach can help reveal intricately linked cross-sectoral factors that can constrain the performance of agricultural technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {As groundwater levels steadily decline in India, authorities are concerned about reducing extraction for irrigation purposes without jeopardizing food security. Very low or zero prices for electricity and water in agriculture is partly responsible for overextraction, but charging higher prices is politically not feasible. In this study, we describe the results of a pilot scheme implemented in Punjab, India, where farmers who enrolled were allocated a monthly entitlement of electricity units and compensated for unused electricity. Eight hours of uninterrupted daytime electricity supply were also provided under the scheme instead of the usual mix of daytime and night-time supply. Analyzing data from a cross-sectional farm household survey and instrumenting for enrollment, we find that self-reported hours of irrigation for enrolled farmers were significantly lower than for non-enrolled ones, with no impact on rice yields. We also find a reduction in monthly electricity consumption at electricity-feeder level due to the pilot scheme using the synthetic control method. Our results suggest that the combination of daytime electricity provision and cash incentives for unused electricity has the potential to incentivize farmers to reduce electricity consumption and irrigation hours by at least 7.5% and up to 30% without impacting paddy yields. © 2022 The Authors.

Concern has grown over impacts that land conversion and crop displacement driven by ethanol feedstock production might have on water resources. In this paper, we examine irrigation decisions of agricultural producers in the Kansas portion of the High Plains Aquifer in response to local ethanol market expansion. To identify the effects of ethanol expansion on irrigation decisions, we examine field-level data on irrigation water use, irrigated acreage, and crop decisions for the years 2003–2017 for nearly 23,000 fields in Kansas. We measure the response of three irrigation decisions, (i) irrigated acreage, (ii) irrigation per acre, and (iii) total water use to the introduction and capacity expansion of an ethanol plant. We find that ethanol market expansion did lead to increases in irrigation water use. Specifically, a 10 % increase in ethanol capacity within 50KM increases annual water use by 0.22 % per field (4.8 acre-inches/field). We predict that ethanol markets accounted for about 4% of total irrigated water use in 2017. © 2021 The Author(s)},

In this context, the main objective of this paper is to quantify and discuss on the impacts that this growing Mediterranean exports specialization generated on water resources over the last century. To that aim, we focus on the water embodied in Mediterranean exports, the trends followed by dams' construction and the area equipped for irrigation as well as on the evolution of blue water stress. Our findings point at an intense expansion of Mediterranean virtual water exports between 1910 and 2010 that went along with the construction of water infrastructure. It enabled water-intensive crops to be grown in arid regions, but also, exacerbated blue water stress. We also find important regional divergences, highlighting the role of Spain as a super exporter of Mediterranean crops. Finally, we observe that the trends and patterns of trade flows and the subsequent pressures on water resources are highly conditioned by political, economic and technological developments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Assessment of pollutants and groundwater quality has attracted much attention worldwide as it is directly linked to human health. In view of this, groundwater samples were collected from a part of Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India, to assess groundwater pollution levels and groundwater quality, using Water Pollution Index (WPI) and Water Quality Index (WQI), respectively. Groundwater chemical composition results indicated that groundwater quality was characterized by alkaline and very hard categories with Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+: HCO3- > Cl - > SO42- > NO3- > F - facies. TDS, TH, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl -, NO3-, and F - were above the recommended threshold limits in 100%, 100%, 35%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 95%, 85%, and 75% of groundwater samples, respectively, for drinking purposes. The geochemical diagram showed base exchange water type (Na+–HCO3-) in 50% of groundwater samples resulting from weathering and dissolution of plagioclase feldspars under the influence of soil CO2 and ion exchange process. The remaining groundwater samples showed saline water type (Na+–Cl -) due to the influence of evaporation, sewage sludge, septic tank leaks, irrigation-return flows, agrochemicals, etc. Ionic relationships of Ca2+/Na+vs HCO3-/Na+, Ca2+/Na+vs Mg2+/Na+, higher Na+ than Ca2+, and occurrence of CaCO3 concretions further supported geogenic processes that alter groundwater chemistry. The positive linear trend of TDS vs Cl - + NO3-/HCO3- and the relationship of TDS with TH showed anthropogenic input as the main factor, causing groundwater contamination. The WPI indicated two categories of water quality: moderately polluted water (WPI: 0.75–1.00) and highly polluted water (WPI: > 1.00) in 60% and 40% of groundwater samples, which were 81.49% and 18.51% of the study area, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three clusters: Cluster I (pH, F -, Ca2+, K+, NO3-, Na+, and SO42−), Cluster II (TH, Mg2+, Cl -, and HCO3-), and Cluster III (TDS) support WPI. Following WQI, 75% and 25% of groundwater samples fell under poor groundwater quality type (WQI: 100–200) and very poor groundwater quality type (> 200), respectively, especially due to the increased concentrations of Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO32−, Cl -, NO3-, and F - ions, thereby increasing salinity (TDS) and hardness (TH) in groundwater. Spatially, they covered 85.84% and 14.06% of the study area. The quality of this groundwater is not suitable for drinking purposes. Therefore, the present study suggests preventive measures (safe drinking water supply, desalinization, defluoridation, denitrification, calcium food, and rainwater harvesting) to protect human health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

The results reveal the social demand for AES and the disutility of AEDS, as well as the non-linearity in marginal utility for some of these AES and AEDS. Food provision, temperature regulation, leisure and recreation and biodiversity are socially perceived as AES. The water supply for irrigation switches between AES and AEDS depending on its provision level, while groundwater pollution is conceived as one of the AEDS.

From a sample of 841 rice farmers in rural Haiti, I randomly selected 277 to participate in public goods games framed to mimic the real trade-off they face between private work and participation in the management of shared canals. Over the subsequent planting season, the local irrigation association organized voluntary canal-cleaning days to manage the shared canal systems that irrigate farmers’ fields. Treated farmers were 56% more likely than those in the control group to volunteer. The mechanisms through which the treatment seemed to operate was by increasing social connections between plot neighbors and shifting participants’ expectations of others’ contributions to the public good, suggesting that public goods games provide a setting in which to connect with and learn about one's neighbors and to develop common norms of behavior. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We use optimization of a structural dynamic model to evaluate the cost of carbon sequestration when afforestation subsidies are used to encourage private landowners to switch from cropland to forestry. Our model allows for the planting of either softwood or hardwood forest types with flexible rotation lengths, in addition to irrigated crops. We apply the model to a portion of the Lower Mississippi River Basin in Arkansas where groundwater overdraft lowers the profitability of irrigated crops. In our baseline model with a 5% discount rate, a subsidy for afforestation from $1000 to $4500 per acre increases pine plantings, aquifer volume, and carbon sequestration above the levels without a subsidy. The average cost to sequester a ton of carbon increases from $13 ($3.55 per ton CO2eq) at the lowest subsidy to $36 ($9.84 per ton CO2eq) at the highest. Lower costs are achievable when soybeans are prominent on the landscape and high costs result when rice and corn dominate. Reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% changes the afforestation type from fast growing softwoods to slow growing hardwoods, and this substantially lowers the cost of carbon sequestration. Delaying the implementation of an afforestation subsidy until irrigation costs rise from groundwater scarcity will increase the costs of carbon sequestration because many landowners will choose forest types with longer rotations without a subsidy. A carbon credit scheme leads to only afforestation by no harvest hardwoods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Information for the study was gained through a questionnaire and focus group discussions with small-scale irrigation farmers as well as key informant interviews with government irrigation officials, irrigation managers and members of the local community leadership. The information was garnered between August and December in 2017 with the analysis conducted using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, guided by the Theory of Constraints and classified in the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) framework. Results indicated that SSIS are important in the drought-prone areas of the Chipinge District regarding food security and income generation. However, technical issues bedevilling the schemes are considered to be the most challenging limitations. The most important constraints—ranked in descending order of gravity—are technical, economic, social, environmental, legal and political challenges.

Design/methodology/approach: The study extends the drainage factor into the AWD score. The cost benefit analysis is utilized for the economic evaluation, and the Cragg model is applied to examine the determinants of AWD adoption. Findings: The results indicate that there are significant differences in inputs such as water, seed, fertilizers and mechanization between the low and high levels of AWD adoption. The yields are significantly different at different adoption levels. The Cragg model found that irrigation infrastructure, AWD training and perceived ease of use of the technology are determinants of AWD adoption level. Collective pumping is considered as a major constraint in the AWD adoption. Research limitations/implications: The results provide managerial implications, with a focus on the effectiveness of inputs, the irrigation infrastructure and AWD training to promote the AWD adoption. Challenges of rice field flatness should be investigated in a further study. Originality/value: The study contributes to existing literature by providing an empirical evidence for the large-scale adoption of AWD with a comprehensive economic evaluation, extending the drainage performance into the score to accurately reflect the water conservation and promoting the use of a more flexible modeling approach with the Cragg model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Ethiopia is a country with a total population of more than 110 million, of which about 80% of the total population is engaged in subsistence farming in rural areas. Although the agricultural sector plays a great role in the Ethiopian economy, it is characterized by low productivity due to technological and socioeconomic factors. Improving smallholder irrigated tomato production, and productivity would contribute to enhancing food security and alleviating poverty. Therefore, this study was investigated to fill this gap to analyze the technical efficiency of irrigated tomato production and its determinant factors in North Gondar Zone, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Primary data were collected from 160 farmers selected using a multistage sampling procedure and analyzed using descriptive statistics, a parametric stochastic frontier production function model. The stochastic frontier and Cobb–Douglas functional form with a one-step approach were employed to analyze efficiency and factors affecting efficiency in irrigated tomato production. The estimated gamma parameters indicated that 0.69% of the total variation in tomato output was due to technical inefficiency. The means technical efficiency was found 60%, and about 6480.19 kg of tomato output per hectare was lost due to inefficiency factors implying there is a room for improvement in technical efficiency by 40% with the present technology. The Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) result revealed that plot size at 1% and UREA at 10% probability level significantly influenced tomato production. The socio-economic variables that exercised an important role for variations in technical efficiency positively were the level of education, TLU, fair water distribution service and water in the morning, and in contrast watering frequency, marketing training, and credit were found to increase inefficiency significantly among farm households. To get better farmers' efficiency in the production of irrigated tomatoes continuous marketing training should be established and strengthening the available farmers training center (FTC) to improve farm productivity. The government and any concerned bodies should be built irrigation canals and other alternatives to reduce watering frequency. There should be a timely and sufficient supply of UREA to improve farmers’ efficiency in the production of tomatoes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Farmers have a long history of adjusting their production practices in response to changing production conditions. Using a multinomial endogenous treatment effects model that accounts for observable and unobservable heterogeneity, this study investigates the adoption and welfare impacts of climate-resilient practices on Vietnamese rice-cultivating households. We found evidence of clear and positive welfare impacts from the adoption of canal irrigation (CI) and the joint adoption of agricultural conservation practices (CP) and CI as the main adaptation strategies to increase water stress. More importantly, although farmers with access to CI systems obtained the highest returns, the joint adoption of multiple practices still had substantially high adoption rates and significantly positive effects on rice yield, rice revenue and household income. Our findings indicate that farms' and farmers' characteristics, market information and climatic conditions are generally the main factors driving rice farmers' decisions to adopt climate-resilient technologies, both individually and jointly. Follow-up policy interventions should focus on improving CI systems and promoting the joint adoption of climate-resilient technologies to improve rice farmers' well-being and enhance their resilience capacity to cope with incoming climatic uncertainty. © 2023 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

	abstract = {Indigenous fruit trees, though critical to the local livelihoods in many areas across the world, continue to receive little research and policy attention. In this study, we recorded the perceptions of Indian jujube (ber) growers of Haryana, India, to understand how social-ecological stressors were impacting their livelihoods and how they were responding to the constraints being faced using their own creativity and institutional recommendations. Data were recorded through an exploratory research design combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Principal component analysis and variables factor map revealed differential contributions of orchard attributes and adaptive practices to the variability in individual principal components as well as to the cumulative variation. It emerged that despite serious challenges like poor access to the markets, feeble institutional support and the problems of salinity and fresh water scarcity, a large majority (80.0%) of the respondents had moderate to high willingness to continue ber cultivation. Our respondents were almost unanimous that environmentally resilient nature and low input needs make ber an attractive option for the resource-scarce local conditions. We noted, however, that hardy tree nature alone may not be a guarantee to ber groves’ sustainability in the long run and that doable interventions were inevitable to insulate the growers’ livelihoods from risks. Specifically, increased adoption of proven technologies (e.g. mulching, drip irrigation), linking farmers to the markets and organizing them into groups for the pooled use of resources seem absolutely essential to sustain ber-based production systems in face of such challenges. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {In southwestern Tunisia, the intense exploitation of the natural resources (soil, water, hydrocarbons, etc.) bears unrecoverable consequences on the local environment. In fact, the harsh climate conditions, the expansion of irrigated areas (date plantation and greenhouses) and the overexploitation of water resources in these ecologically fragile lands increase understandably desertification in the Kebili field. The field observations in the study indicate that the sustainability of natural resources is threatened, besides increasing soil salinization and water degradation. The used water quality indexes (BCWQI, OWQI and WAWQI) indicate that more than 55% of the samples are unsuitable for domestic consumption and irrigation purposes. The contamination of the CI water and the agricultural lands by crude mature organic matter is confirmed by the elevated concentrations of organic compounds that range between 1.8 and 16 mg/L in the sampled waters, while they reach the 80 mg/L in the surface horizon in the oases in Mazraa Neji and Oum El Fareth areas. The sensitivity of the study area to different processes of land degradation is evaluated by two multi-criteria models (MEDALUS and IMDPA), which indicate high to very high risks of environmental degradation in the study area with an average geometric mean of 1.67 and 2.8, respectively. Given the potential relevance of the contamination and its long-term impacts on the healthy environmental functioning, this paper outlines the main baselines aspects, the rehabilitation measures and the decontamination actions that should be taken in account in the planning of the most adopted management projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Central Asia is largely dominated by drylands; so agriculture depends on irrigation in most parts of the region, which results in large scale water withdrawal, mainly from rivers, and, consequently, water scarcity. Climate change is expected to aggravate such water shortages as river flows are predicted to be substantially reduced during the second half of this century, which will put additional strain on irrigated agriculture. Tree wind breaks are one option to reduce water consumption in irrigated agriculture, add to farm income, and are therefore prioritized by government policies. Still, many farmers fear that tree wind breaks may compromise crop yields and income. Therefore, based on preceding studies this paper investigates the water productivity – net present value by unit of water consumed – of tree wind break systems of single row tree rows combined with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) compared with those crops under open field conditions. The tree wind break systems attained higher water productivities across all crops, different discount rates, tree ages of tree wind breaks, and varying crop yields. Tree wind break systems at 200 m spacing attained higher water productivities than those at 1000 m spacing. In conclusion, tree wind breaks can be inserted into the irrigated agriculture as an additional source of farm income, source for wood resources, and help reducing overall water consumption in irrigated agriculture. Simple tree lines are put forward, as multiple tree rows have been shown not to attain financial gains and save less water than the single tree lines. © 2021},

	abstract = {Irrigation, along with a high-yielding variety of seeds and chemical fertilizer, is a crucial component of contemporary agricultural technology for enhancing yield in a semi-arid agrarian region of Rarh Bengal. The investigation aims to determine the spatio-temporal disparity in irrigation intensity, the source-wise irrigation utilization index (IUI), and the cumulative annual exponential growth rate (CAEGR) of irrigation in the study region from 2009–2010 to 2017–2018 and also tries to find out the link between irrigation intensity (II) and source-wise irrigation utilization (IUI) using Karl Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient, linear regression analysis, and residual mapping through the Ordinary least squares method. Irrigation intensity is mostly concentrated in the eastern and south-eastern areas, as opposed to the dry, upland western and north-western districts. The district's net irrigated area has a significantly positive CAEGR (+ 3.34); however, at the block level, there is a downward tendency in both the river lift and other irrigated areas. The study also explores a considerable association between the source-wise IUI and II [F (5,16) = 25.341, p < 0.001]. Canal IUI, being the dominant source of surface irrigation, proved to be inevitable for the irrigational development of the entire study domain (B = 46.724, t = 7.383, p ≤ 0.001) and (B = 48.202, t = 6.850, p ≤ 0.001), which accounts 72.09% and 80.61% variation in II in both years. Finally, to maintain the sustainability of irrigation, effective management of water has become a concerning issue in this semi-arid region of Rarh Bengal. Therefore, the minor surface irrigation schemes along with the conservation of traditional irrigation and water harvesting systems as an alternative irrigation management approach are becoming increasingly important for future irrigation development.

We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with manufacturers, farmers, government agents, and made field observations on 18 farms in 2020/2021. The diffusion of the pivot was enabled by extending the innovation system to trusted innovation intermediaries in new settings, who played an active role in adapting the technology and support services to local agrarian systems. However, while the innovation homeland can be considered an open innovation environment, manufacturing and after-sales services in the new settings were tightly controlled by manufacturers to secure intellectual property and maintain a monopoly.

	abstract = {Purpose: The emerging technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are transforming various industries, including agriculture. Unaware, young male and female farmers leave the agriculture profession as they perform unsustainable practices. Precision agriculture using the Internet of Things (IoT) is a solution to sustainable agriculture. Extension professionals are at the heart of disseminating agricultural advisory agricultural services in India. The discourse on the IoT is entering the space of extension advisory services (EASs) and social sciences. Thus, the present paper seeks to review the application of IoT in Indian agriculture, its challenges and its effect on EASs. The conceptual framework is drawn from disruptive and surveillance capitalist theories. Design/methodology/approach: Online literature review was conducted on electronic e-book Ebsco, Google scholar, PubMed, Jane, j gate, research4life, springer journal and Mendeley databases for full-text repositories, textbook, thesis, web articles, newspaper articles, reports, blogs for the year 1990 to May 2021 using keywords “IoT application in agriculture,” “emerging technologies in agriculture,” “challenges in IoT application,” “extension advisory services sources of information,” “big data and extension advisory, “IoT and extension advisory in India.” Only publications in the English language were included. Findings: IoT aids progressive farmers and small farmers alike. Drones, robotics, precision irrigation, livestock tracking and crop disease surveillance are examples of IoT applications in agriculture. Only large corporations and governments access IoT, and for them, big data storage is an issue. Privacy and security concerns demand upgrades in IoT systems. Solutions to the convergence of IoT with the cloud will leverage agricultural EASs, resulting in fast computing, precise and proactive up-to-date problem solving. Hence, the need for communication between firms and clients has ceased. Thus, the jobs of extension agents are replaced. Research limitations/implications: The competence of future human extension agents lies in reskilling as a “knowledge broker” of relationships and expertise, as s/he cannot have all multidisciplinary knowledge. Originality/value: Although IoT applications in agriculture are available from a technological standpoint, there remains an awareness gap regarding the impact of IoT applications in agricultural EASs. This study will aid in a better comprehension of IoT applications from current and prospective EASs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The design of federal crop insurance has attracted the interest and attention of many economists and policymakers in the United States. Moral hazard is a frequently cited concern, as insurance may reduce the incentive for farmers to manage properly their agricultural operation. Moral hazard could play a role in irrigation decisions by incentivizing a farmer to choose a riskier irrigation management strategy, potentially affecting the long-term sustainability of water resources. We use numerical simulation to determine if insurance coverage affects incentives on seasonal irrigation use. Results show that the potential for moral hazard at current costs and policy parameters is low, but that there is potential for moral hazard behavior when the cost of irrigation is high. Hence, conservation policies that increase the cost of irrigation cost (e.g., a water tax) may amplify the potential for moral hazard. In most cases, crop insurance provides a secondary effect that reduces irrigation use in addition to the direct water tax effect, although this reduction comes at increased taxpayer expense. However, it is possible that irrigation use increases under crop insurance. Therefore, there is a need for the explicit consideration of the unintended side effects of crop insurance on farmers’ irrigation water use decisions, particularly in regions experiencing water scarcity and rising marginal costs of irrigation. © 2021 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Vinasse is one of the worst waste products in the production of ethanol. However, it can be used to generate biogas, electricity, and carbon credits from biodigesters and concentrators. Thus, studying the use of vinasse is justified, and this study asks the following research question: How feasible is it to use internal circulation biodigesters with the vinasse concentrator Citrotec®, and their conjugates in energy and environmental terms? To answer this question, the study employs quantitative methodology. To analyze this in terms of energy, the consumption of diesel in vinasse logistics has been calculated, the balance of energy in its processing and transport, its generation of electricity, and its capacity in terms of storage in urban centers. It has also been in terms of its incremental capacity in the production of cellulosic ethanol, the generation of electricity, and substitution for diesel, gasoline, and ethanol in the states of Brazil. The environmental analysis includes the balance and emission and mitigation of nitrous, sulfur, and carbon oxides in the processing and transport of vinasse, as well the figures for each Brazilian state that produces ethanol and the potential gains in the carbon credit market. The principal innovations of this article are a detailed analysis of the production ranges for autonomous sugar energy plants with a range of production from 500 to 4000 m3/day, the processing and logistics of vinasse for planting, as well as an analysis of each Brazilian state for the 2015/2016 crop. According to our results and review of the literature, the reuse of vinasse is recommended due to its energy and environmental gains, in a way that maintains the fertilizing and irrigation characteristics of the residues, particularly the IC biodigesters and concentrators and their conjugates. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Four planned farm adaptation indexes were created and analysed, with findings suggesting that land size, previous adaptation experience and credit access were positively associated with all types of adaptation. The results from the two waves of survey analysis also indicated very different influences between planned and actual practices, with the proportion of farmers actually undertaking a particular practice far greater than those who planned to undertake it. This result might be related to the project intervention within the study schemes, where numerous factors previously hampering irrigation were resolved, increasing farmers' ability to adapt. Enhancing the availability and quality of education, extension services and finance could be valuable in encouraging further farm adaptation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Using data from the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS), we construct a panel household dataset from 2010 to 2016. This sample consists of 618 households in two provinces, Ha Tay and Nghe An, where plot exchange was implemented intensively in the period of study. We apply two-way fixed effects regression to mitigate the endogeneity in household participation in plot exchange. The results indicate that plot exchange halved the number of household plots dedicated to annual crop production. While the impact on land productivity was statistically insignificant, land consolidation via plot exchange dramatically reduced household labor allocated to crop production, especially rice production. Further analyses reveal that the labor effects may come from improved farm irrigation and increased machine rentals. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland},

	abstract = {In dry-hot areas, such as southern Tunisia, the availability of good water is very limited by the low scanty rainfall, the long dry periods and the high evaporation rate. Thus, to deal with these issues, information concerning the quality of irrigation water and the variability of groundwater quality across the oasis system from water well to the final runoff released into the natural environment, is required to evaluate the potential impacts on agricultural soil fertility and to assess the effects of land-use and agricultural practices in environmental conservation and natural resources exploitation. In the current study, 28 water samples have been collected from public wells along the irrigation scheme and drainage canals and have been analyzed. The obtained data prove that groundwater has large spatial variability (EC between 2.93 and 10.05 ms/cm and TDS between 1.95 and 8.15 g/L) caused by different influencing factors such as aquifer water quality, overexploitation, distribution system and evaporation processes. According to the used ionic ratios (SAR, KR, PI, MH, TH, SSP, ESP, etc.), the used waters are locally of permissible quality, while the majority fall unsuitable class to be used in irrigation with a maximum SAR of 18 at El Hamma region. The findings indicate that, besides the severe restrictions required for the use of these high mineralized resources, CI water quality shows a slight variability along irrigation scheme, which may provide additive water resources that may be reused in agriculture, the runoff released into the environment and the excess of irrigation water lost to evaporation process. The evaluation of chemical quality of drainage water may provide a scientific basis for the reuse of these waters to more efficient land management aiming to the sustainable development of oasis agriculture and the prevention of land degradation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Bioenergy crops can contribute to the reduction of overall consumption of fossil fuels; however, India is a heavily populated agriculture economy demanding huge amounts of food and energy, so use of agricultural lands to produce energy crops puts a direct pressure on agri-based economy. A collaborative project for development of Sustainable Advanced Lignocellulosic Biofuel Systems was launched in 2012 between USA and India emphasizing high biomass bamboo, sorghum and pearl millet feedstock cultivation at marginal ecologies in 9 villages of 3 districts of Gujarat state in India. A baseline survey was conducted by interviewing 415 households followed by focus group discussion to understand socioeconomic profile of the targeted region, agricultural practices, awareness and inclination of local growers toward commercialization of biofuels crops. Survey data were analyzed using SPSS statistical tool. The survey showed that land holding of 2.5–5 acres and 5–10 acres was prevalent, with rain-fed and borewell irrigation and average soil quality having medium to shallow deep soil structure. Annual income from farm showed positive association with soil quality, while lower productivity from bad-quality soil. Households were interested to grow biofuel crops only if they give better net profit as compared to current crops. Good land quality, larger cultivated area and joint family had relatively less risk of bioenergy crop production than the counterpart. Household having above poverty line (77.8%) signified annual income of more than 10,000 INR. Lower literacy rate showed that 5–15% of the members migrated out of village for temporary seasonal livelihood. The districts were well connected with roads with enough frequency of state and private vehicles, railways, government postal services, mobile phone network and round the time electricity for household entitled the districts to penetrate bioenergy market. Leveraging available infrastructure and adopting large-scale co-operative mechanized farming, crop rotation within agro-forestry system, diversification of food, fiber and energy crops through policy support would bring economic and environmental benefits along with new market, job creation and bioenergy industries at surveyed ecology. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Replacing traditional fossil fuel with bioethanol has been adopted in many countries to reduce carbon emissions and achieve climate mitigation targets. However, the soaring global demand for food and bioethanol in the future may impose heavy environmental pressure on major sugar crops producing regions of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) through significant changes in land and water uses. Irrigation expansion in the rainfed dominant cropping areas would partially slow down the land use expansion by boosting yields, but require large-scale investments. This study assesses the future land and water demand triggered by sugar crops expansion from the food-energy-water/land nexus perspective through coupling the Global Agro-Ecological Zones model (GAEZ) with Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) analysis. We further analyse the tradeoffs between water and land use under future scenarios of climate change and socio-economic development regarding to the expected goals of biofuel policies and irrigation expansion strategies in LAC countries due to sufficient local water resources. The results show that the projected water and land demand of sugar crops in LAC would increase by 198% and 205% from 2014 to 2040. Increasing the low- or non- irrigated area up to 50% would mitigate the yield loss and reduce the land demand by 10%, with limited impact on the local water resources in most LAC countries. Major bioethanol producers with limited water demand compared with available water resources, such as Brazil and Argentina, could further promote irrigation to avoid significant landuse change and benefit other countries’ land ecosystems via inter-regional bioethanol trade. While in potential higher water stress countries, including Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico, under bioenergy orientated policy in 2040, reducing biofuel policy targets or importing bioethanol from resource rich countries would be a better option. These results could provide guidelines to balance sugar crops production and sustainable water and land use strategies across LAC. © 2021},

	abstract = {The main challenge in the agricultural sector is to increase crop production with minimal water consumption. In this regard, various high efficient irrigation systems have received particular attention. This paper investigates drip (tape) irrigation (DTI). It estimates water productivity (WP), application efficiency (AE) and corn yield in the Miandoab region located in the southeast of Lake Urmia using swarm intelligence methods. The studies were performed in-field monitoring by using a hybrid approach based on an extreme machine learning method (ELM) and tree growth optimization algorithm (TGO) to estimate corn yield, WP, and AE criteria. TGO-ELM method was evaluated on a dataset including irrigation-fertilizer, climate, and soil characteristics of corn fields from 2020 to 2021. The DTI method was compared with the standard furrow irrigation (FI). The field monitoring results showed that the DTI increased corn yield, WP, and AE by 22.2%, 0.58 kg/m3, and 70%, respectively, compared to the FI method. The modeling results showed that model M9 gave a more optimistic estimate of the corn crop, WP and AE by applying the parameters of irrigation levels, rainfall, and soil moisture as model inputs. Also, TGO-ELM with optimal values ​​of R2 = 0.988, RMSE = 0.005, NSE = 0.981, and MAPE = 0.812 had a good performance compared to similar intelligent methods. The results confirmed that TGO-ELM can provide a more accurate estimation of corn yield compared to other similar methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This study explores the efficiency of alternative public expenditures to support Indian agriculture and encourage private on-farm investment. Specifically, the paper examines the crowding-in effect of input subsidies and other forms of public investments on private on-farm investment. The study uses an autoregressive distributive lag model and data from 1980 to 2018. Findings reveal that irrigation subsidy strongly induces private on-farm investment over the long-run and short-run. However, public expenditures on research, education, and the area served by public canals have a significant crowding-in effect on private on-farm investment over the short and long run. Other factors that stimulate private investment in Indian agriculture include institutional credit, favorable agricultural terms of trade, and future demand for food. Thus, policymakers should better target and rationalize public expenditures programs. Policy recommendations include removing unproductive input subsidies (such as fertilizer and power subsidies) and diverting the freed resources toward public investment in Indian agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The severe shortage of water resources is the most important cause of the uncontrolled abstraction of groundwater resources in semi-arid regions. In this regard, modeling and forecasting groundwater levels can help in the accurate estimation of watershed water consumption and sustainable agricultural development. In the present study, the interaction effect of surface and groundwater using SWAT, WEAP, and MODFLOW models on agricultural water consumption of Kavar plain in Fars province has been evaluated. Also, the simultaneous impact of climate change, increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems, and changing the cultivation pattern to predict the groundwater level in the future were analyzed. For these purposes, first, the changes in crop pattern and type of irrigation systems during the decade 2008 to 2018 were investigated; then different management scenarios were defined to balance the groundwater level. The results of predicting climatic parameters indicate that in all three scenarios of emissions in the next period (2021–2040), the temperature will increase (0.54–1.01 °C) and precipitation will decrease (3–10%). The combination of SWAT and WEAP models with the MODFLOW model showed that by using these models, the interaction behavior of surface water and groundwater, the amount of recharges, and groundwater level can be quantitatively simulated. Also, applying different irrigation scenarios in the models showed that by adjusting the cultivation pattern and improving surface and pressurized irrigation efficiencies, the amount of groundwater abstraction in dry and normal conditions can be reduced by 23 to 42 percent. Therefore, the groundwater level will increase in the next period. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

For the empirical analysis, rural household survey data, which was matched with rainfall variability data and experimentally generated measures of risk preference, was used. The results show that increased rainfall variability prompts households to reduce the application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertiliser, but bolsters the application of low-risk inputs such as manure. These results are robust to alternative specifications and support the theoretical predictions developed. The findings suggest the following policy implications for chemical fertiliser use among risk-averse smallholder farmers in areas characterized by rainfall variability. First, developing more weather-resilient crop varieties and irrigation could stimulate higher use of chemical fertiliser by producing more stable yields. Secondly, weather index insurance (WII) could incentivize higher chemical fertiliser use by reducing income risk and easing liquidity constraints. Thirdly, social protection such as cash transfer programmes could lead to a higher use of chemical fertiliser by serving as insurance against income risks (i.e., through providing regular and predictable financial resources). © 2022 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

In the oases in the M’zab valley in the Algerian Sahara, the collective action that upholds these initiatives has been challenged in past decades by the development of intensive groundwater use with individual pumps in new agricultural areas. However, faced with water shortage and inspired by the more circular irrigation practices in oases, farmers are increasingly creating local use loops in these extension areas by installing recharge devices and using water more carefully. This study analyzes the functioning of the circular managed aquifer recharge and use system in Beni Isguen oasis, and how farmers have reinvented it in agricultural extensions, creatively combining it with modern technologies to engage in market-oriented agriculture.

We identify impacts on satellite-derived forest greenness and cover using village-level variation in the timing of infrastructure investments. We find that irrigation investments improved conditions in nearby forests and that rural road projects did not, on average, worsen forest conditions. These impacts appear to occur through gains in agricultural productivity on already cleared land. Only in the most densely forested regions do road improvements lead to greater forest loss.

Yet, studies estimating how clean groundwater is valued are not available in Ghana. In addition, some research suggests that the pre-experiment information provided to survey respondents affects their valuation of an identical outcome. This paper estimates smallholder farmers’ preferences for groundwater protection using pre-experiment information focused on one of two outcomes: environment or health. The double-bounded contingent valuation (DBCV) approach is used to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) to protect groundwater quality. The estimation accounts for shift and anchoring effects, which are common issues with the DBCV method. The mean WTP from the health (environmental) information subsample is about US$19 (US$17) per acre, and the values are significantly different between the information conditions. The findings shed light on the importance of using precise information in eliciting WTP in a developing country setting. © 2021 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Adaptation gaps arise when observed adaptation to climate change is slower than perceived adaptation potential. Two common explanations for adaptation gaps are (1) private parties failing to recognize that the climate is changing and (2) the cost of adaptation is higher than commonly believed. This paper shows how these two explanations are linked and that the likelihood and duration of adaptation gaps depend on whether climate change is characterized by stationary or non-stationary dynamics. Using an investment in water-saving irrigation in California's Central Valley as an illustrative example, we find little evidence that failing to account for climate change would explain adaptation gaps. A more likely explanation for adaptation gaps is a failure to account for the adaptation option value that arises due to the possibility of maladaptation.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Eliminating ultra-poverty has received particular attention of policymakers and scholars. The ultra-poor in mountainous regions often live on subsistence farming and natural resource extraction. One of the sustainable ways to support them is to find alternative livelihood options that reduce natural resource extraction and increase household income. During the last decades, Vietnam has reduced its poverty significantly. However, the ultra-poor still exist especially among ethnic minority groups in the northern mountains, increasing pressures on already degraded forest resources. This paper assessed the contribution of indigenous pig production to the welfare of ultra-poor ethnic minority households using the propensity score matching method and identified the factors affecting indigenous pig production using generalized Poisson, negative binomial and binary logistic regression models. The analysis was based on the data of 495 rural households surveyed in 2019. Results showed that (1) indigenous pig production had significant and positive effects on household income of and multidimensional poverty reduction among ultra-poor ethnic minority households and (2) the factors positively affecting indigenous pig production are access to credits, number of motorbikes, government support under the poverty reduction programs, road type at the villages, and irrigation systems, while the effects of distance from home to the nearest agricultural input shops and access to the national electricity are negative. We suggest the government to continue improving irrigation systems, road conditions and access to national electricity grids in this mountainous region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In addition, we also incorporate the use of social comparison messages. We argue that farmers will adopt AWD despite flat fee tariffs if farmers own their pumps and if their crops can reach their varietal potential.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to statistically test the effect of a parcel index – consisting of a combination of a soil index, a fertility index and a location index – intended to be used as a price-determining indicator for the sale of agricultural land at farmland markets. In the hedonic price model, the coefficients of the variables representing parcel index, population, gross return and parcel irrigation investment status were positive and statistically significant at a significance level of 0.01. There was a negative relationship between parcel size and sale price, which implied that the selling price per decare tends to decrease as the parcel size increases. In the study area, the prices of farmland with large parcel sizes and irrigation efficiency investments were higher. The population density in the region and gross income from farmlands were the major factors that generated demand for the land. The hedonic price model establishes an important link between the parcel index and the sale price of farmland. Based on this link, parcel index-based pricing can contribute significantly to the creation of a farmland market in Turkey. © 2022, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Group members had an extra four days of access to water in a month, and applied at least 130 kg/ha more inorganic fertiliser, than non-group members. Group members had a higher household income per capita and more assets than nongroup members. However, the result revealed a heterogeneous effect among group members, with the benefits varying according to members' socio-economic characteristics as well as internal group dynamics. The government and private donors should continue to promote the formation and organisation of farmers into groups. The role of group membership in farming outcomes can be enhanced if smaller groups are promoted. It is also crucial that strategies for promoting trust, reciprocity and group commitment be implemented for better group outcomes. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Major international agreements governing the shared use of transboundary waters rarely deal explicitly with species conservation, yet they often have major implications for aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species. To meet conservation objectives, it may be necessary to find flexibility, or “adaptive capacity” within these agreements to enable conservation measures. This study applies incident analysis to assess the adaptive capacity of the Canada–US Columbia River Treaty (CRT) to respond to evolving species conservation needs. Like many other transboundary agreements, the terms of the CRT cover power production, flood protection and irrigation, but not species conservation. We analyze the discourses and normative expectations of politically relevant actors regarding an international conflict with Canada over the use of flow modifications by US agencies to conserve an endangered species of sturgeon. Four distinct discourse coalitions formed around the issue, each with its own interpretation of the problem, normative expectations about the rules that should apply, and power to shape decision making. The incident highlights how domestic conservation laws can directly impinge upon an international transboundary water treaty, and how flexibility can be found within existing institutional arrangements for conservation purposes. However, new norms for fish conservation were not fully incorporated into the CRT and decision-making authority for conservation-related disputes became more entrenched in the Treaty’s implementing agencies, potentially further excluding actors who might support fish conservation, such as environmental organizations and Indigenous governments. We recommend strategies to increase the adaptive capacity of the CRT and similar international agreements to enable species conservation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh frequently suffers from acute riverbank erosions and, as a result, every year a large number of people internally migrate to new places mainly in search of livelihoods. While very few studies focus on the multifaceted nature of vulnerability experienced from riverbank erosions, the present study examines to what extent different drivers of vulnerability affect socio-economically disadvantaged internal migrants living in riverbank erosion-prone areas in Bangladesh. Empirical evidence from two north-western riverbank erosion-prone districts in Bangladesh demonstrates that the disadvantaged internal migrants and their household members were exposed to a range of vulnerabilities connected to economic, institutional, infrastructural, environmental, and social drivers. It is contended that evidently there are different types of vulnerability some of which are perceived to be more severe than others in the study areas. This study, therefore, suggests extending some specific support programmes including income generation schemes, access to institutional credit for the landless, improved inexpensive means of transportation, and improved communication. This article also proposes improving rural infrastructure including irrigation facilities, inexpensive transportation means for agricultural inputs or other farming materials, reasonable prices for daily necessities, and improved health care benefits. © 2022 SAGE Publications.},

This study aims to determine and prioritize the main driving forces of desertification in northeastern Iran and to provide appropriate management strategies. This paper proposes effective policies and strategies using the multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM)–drivers, pressures, states, impacts, responses (DPSIR) approach to reduce the impact of desertification risk in arid regions of northeastern Iran. The main driving forces of desertification were obtained and ranked in terms of significance using one of the most recent approaches in MCDM, i.e., the PROMETHEE method, based on the opinions of 113 experts, field studies, and previous research in the region. The results indicated the existence of 29 main driving forces of desertification. The PROMETHEE method calculates the significance of factors using the phi statistic. The top 15 driving forces, i.e., those with positive phi values (ranged between 0.0071 and 0.0714), were identified and ranked. These 15 driving forces included overgrazing, land-use change, improper land management, drought, reduced precipitation, soil salinity, overpopulation, erosion, waterlogging, overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, inappropriate tillage, improper irrigation, and decreased soil fertility. We found that sensitive biological and physical components are at risk of desertification in the western part of the study area. Such sensitive components can accelerate desertification processes in the places, where they are originated. Accordingly, five categories of policies and 25 strategies for long-term ecologically sustainable management were formulated and suggested based on the prevailing environmental factors, field surveys, and experts’ opinions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

However, such studies have hardly extended our understanding of institutional diversity to combinations of different institutions and their joint impacts on the dynamics of SES. We address this gap by focusing on government-managed irrigation systems as a quintessential example of SESs. We developed a formal stylized model to examine how institutions affect social processes in a government-managed irrigation system. More specifically, we examine how infrastructure dynamics and farmers-agency interactions are affected under the coexistence of two institutions: groundwater market and participatory institutions. The former institutionalizes the use of private irrigation infrastructures as an exit option to the public infrastructure managed by a government agency (exit). The latter institutionalizes farmers' voicing of concerns and participation as a pressure mechanism on the agency (voice). The model results show that the joint effects of those institutions on system outcomes vary with the agency's reactions to the exit and voice. We also demonstrate that the silence option – use of neither option – is a double-edged sword. Silent farmers can impede infrastructure improvement, but in some cases, help it dramatically. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Water resources are indispensable for human existence and agricultural irrigation, particularly in countries where the agricultural sector occupies a substantial proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP). Consequently, improving agricultural water-use efficiency has become a critical strategic choice. Egypt is one of the countries in the world that falls below the water poverty line, and the water scarcity in Egypt has been exacerbated over the last several years. Sustainable growth and food security in Egypt necessitate more efficient use of the country’s water resources, particularly in the irrigation of crops and livestock. Therefore, this study analyzed the potential economic and social impacts of irrigation infrastructure development on Egypt’s economic growth. Furthermore, it sought to ascertain whether investments directed toward irrigation modernization projects are sufficient to alleviate Egypt’s water crisis, an essential question for Egyptian policymakers. The computable general equilibrium model was employed on the basis of a social accounting matrix for the Egyptian economy in its latest edition for the base year 2015. This study employed the latest version of the Agriculture Investment for Development Analyzer, developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute, which provided a more holistic account of the agricultural sector and a high diversity of population details. The results show that the effects of investments in irrigation are favorable for the economy but are relatively modest. Furthermore, the increase in investments in irrigation improves production in most sectors. Moreover, the GDP is anticipated to increase by 0.05% by 2030. In conclusion, adopting the modernization process for irrigation will enable Egypt to observe the success of the modernization program under various scenarios. Indeed, efforts to achieve irrigation modernization are insufficient heretofore. Finally, this study recommends that Egyptian policymakers invest more in developing irrigation infrastructure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Homestead food production (HFP) programs may improve diet and nutrition outcomes by increasing availability of nutrient dense foods such as vegetables and supporting livelihoods. We conducted a pair-matched cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vegetable home gardens could improve women's dietary diversity, household food security, maternal and child iron status, and the probability of women consuming nutrient-rich food groups. We enrolled 1006 women of reproductive age (18–49 years) in ten villages in Pwani Region, Eastern Tanzania, matched the villages into pairs according to village characteristics, and randomly allocated villages to intervention or control. Households in the intervention villages received agricultural training, inputs to promote home production of nutritious crops, and nutrition and health education. Data were collected in 2016, 2017, and 2019 and analyzed using linear regression models with propensity score weighting adjusting for individual-level confounders, differential loss to follow-up, and fixed effects for village pairs to accommodate the pair-matched design. Results after one year of the intervention (previously published) found significant improvements in dietary diversity. However, three years after the start of the intervention the difference in dietary diversity disappeared, even though the number of women who grew at least one crop was significantly higher (75 percentage points, 95% CI: 72, 81) in treatment households compared to controls. Barriers to maintaining a home garden, including lack of irrigation opportunities and fencing materials, and social disruption may have precluded sustained impacts from home gardening in this context. Future home garden programs should carefully consider mechanisms and investments needed for sustained impact over time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We propose a model that simulates climate change impacts on crop production and food prices under partial equilibrium. Our model incorporates a system of Laspeyres price and quantity indices that link structurally estimated community-level produce supply functions to market level demand functions. The supply estimation accounts for corner solutions associated with disaggregate land use observations and is constrained to reproduce aggregate supply data. We use the model to assess climate change impacts in Israel, which protects local agriculture by import tariffs and quotas. The simulation results vary greatly when we allow prices to change as a response to supply changes, highlighting the importance of endogenizing prices in climate change simulations. The results imply that climate changes projected for Israel are expected to be beneficial to farmers, particularly due to the positive impact of the forecasted large temperature rise on field crop production. Fruit outputs are projected to decline, and reduce consumer surplus, but to a lower extent than the increase in total agricultural profits. Nearly 20% of the profit rise is attributed to farmers’ adaptation through land reallocation. Adaptation to the projected reduction in precipitation by increasing irrigation is found to be warranted from the farmers’ perspective; however, it is not beneficial to society as a whole. Abolishing import tariffs effectively transfers surpluses from producers to consumers, but the impact of this policy on social welfare is relatively modest. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper aims to answer this question in the context of crop and livestock income in the Savanna region of Togo. To that end, we build a bio-economic model based on farm household model theory. Using survey data collected from a sample of 450 farm households in the agricultural year 2012-2013, we identify farm household types through cluster analysis and apply them in the simulation model. From the results, we conclude that at their current costs, soil and water conservation techniques and irrigation can on average provide higher income even under climate change. The policy message we draw from this study is to encourage soil and water conservation techniques and sustainable irrigation as sound strategies for higher income under climate change in the region. © 2021 Presses de Sciences Po.

The objectives of this study are to assess the impacts of the adoption of improved milling technologies and the associated structural transformation of the rice value chain from 2011 to 2019 using the original census of the rice millers in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya. Our empirical analysis uses the doubly robust method and the endogenous switching model, which collectively reveal that the adopters of improved milling machines successfully improved the quality of local milled rice to allow it to compete with imported rice, thereby increasing the amount of domestic rice sold to supermarkets as well as to urban traders and consumers. It is also found through probit regression that a few educated, entrepreneurial rice millers operating in rice milling clusters adopted large-scale improved milling machines that included destoning ability, importing them from China around 2010. Later, smaller-sized improved machines were also introduced and more widely adopted in the rice milling clusters. In contrast, the many other millers that did not adopt improved machines were forced to down-size their business or exit the industry. These results imply that adopting improved milling technologies, including destoners, is critical to improving the competitiveness of SSA's domestic rice against imported rice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The poverty reduction, livelihood improvement, and equity promotion potential of Community Forests (CF) from a theoretical point of view are indisputable, but their realization appears more questionable because of the setting and enforcement of rules which limit the access to CFs and forest products. This manuscript is prepared based on the data from 45 CF User Groups (CFUGs) including 1111 households of Nepal. This paper aims to determine the level of access to different forest products (firewood, fodder, timber), redistribution of natural resource value (loan), and CFUG-funded public infrastructure (irrigation, electricity, schooling, water) among different groups of users based on social (caste), political (executive committee membership, political elite), and socioeconomic categories (wellbeing ranks). Pair-wise test was done to understand, if there is any significant difference in access to benefits between these groups. Logistic regression was run to know the relationship of different independent variables with access to forest products and forest-accrued benefits. Statistical analysis reveals very few statistically significant differences in access to benefits between households when grouped on the basis of caste, followed by wellbeing ranks. However, political status and connectedness, namely membership in an executive committee, is significantly and positively associated with more lucrative benefits (e.g., timber, loan). Female-headed households are found always negatively (and significantly in some benefits) associated with all benefits. This study indicates that there is a need for a paradigm shift in studies and policies from caste- and wealth-based analysis to power, political status and connectedness to the decision-making bodies. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Increasing population pressure and population density in many African countries are inducing land scarcity and land constraints. Tightening land constraints are expected to trigger various responses, including agricultural intensification, as postulated by the Boserup hypothesis. The relevance of the Boserup hypothesis in irrigated agriculture, and in contexts where application of improved inputs is high, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while much of the debate on the topic in Africa has focused on how to boost agricultural intensification, there is scant evidence on whether evolving agricultural intensification practices in some parts of Africa are sustainable. In this article, we investigate the implication of land size (at the plot and farm level) on agricultural intensification. Our analysis sheds light on the relevance of the Boserup hypothesis in the context of Egypt, where irrigation dominates agriculture and input application rates are high relative to global standards. We also examine whether evolving agricultural intensification practices induced by land scarcity are agronomically appropriate. Our findings show that smaller plot and farm sizes are associated with higher application of agricultural inputs, mainly nitrogen fertilizers. Importantly, small plot size is associated with overapplication of nitrogen fertilizer relative to crop-specific agronomic recommendations. In addition, smaller plots are associated with higher rates of labor application and lower rates of mechanization. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Credit constraint is often considered as one of the key barriers to the adoption of modern agricultural technologies and low agricultural productivity in low- and middle-income countries. Past research and much of the policy discourse associate agricultural credit constraints with supply-side factors, such as limited access to credit sources or high costs of borrowing. However, demand-side factors, such as risk-aversion and financial illiteracy among borrowers could also affect credit-rationing of smallholder agricultural households. This study investigates the nature of credit constraints, factors affecting credit constraint status, and the effects of credit constraints on adoption and intensity of use of three modern agricultural technologies – small-scale irrigation, chemical fertilizer, and improved seeds. The paper also assesses whether credit constraints are gender-differentiated. Primary survey data were collected from sample farmers in Ethiopia and Tanzania, and Tobit and two-step hurdle econometric models were used to analyze these data. Results show that demand-side credit constraints are as important as supply-side factors in conditioning smallholders’ access to credit in both countries. We also find that credit is a binding constraint for the decision to adopt technologies and input use intensity in Tanzania but not statistically significant in Ethiopia. Results suggest that women are more likely to be credit constrained (from both the supply and demand sides) than men in both study countries. Based on these findings, we suggest that policies should focus on addressing both supply- and demand-side credit constraints to credit access, including through targeted interventions to reduce risk, such as crop insurance, and to strengthen the gender sensitivity of credit policies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Along with population growth, agricultural development, increased urbanization, and climate change, water scarcity is expected to worsen. Farmers’ adaptation is one way to cope with the threat of water scarcity. Understanding farmers’ adaptation behavior and the process of implementing adaptation is a prerequisite for designing water scarcity risk management strategies. This study, using a qualitative approach, investigated the methods of water scarcity adaptation by farmers in Khuzestan Province in southwestern Iran and the farmers’ adaptation process using a paradigmatic model. Different adaptation methods were divided into categories including crop management, farm management, irrigation management, economic management, social networking, and knowledge management. The results provide a relatively comprehensive model that consists of six basic parts: understanding the causes and effects of water scarcity, the contextual and intervention factors, adaptation methods, and consequences. This paper presents a model that reflects the complex and repetitive nature of farmers’ decisions and can be used by researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to better understand and describe informed decision-making and the development of policies and interventions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Declining groundwater levels, on-farm water application losses during irrigation, and poor efficiency of pumping systems need special attention amid global concerns of severe water and energy crisis. In the current study, electricity consumption for groundwater pumping in the irrigated areas has been quantified under four scenarios (i.e., business as usual, suggested groundwater recharge to restore declined groundwater levels, and improved efficiency of water application and pumping system). As an individual intervention, replacing the existing pump sets with suitable and efficient pump sets in the study area could lead to electrical energy savings amounting to 34.6–45.2% of the current usage. Likewise, in part of the study area facing a decline in groundwater levels, it was estimated that restoring groundwater levels to the year 1990 level could help reduce the electricity consumption for groundwater pumping by 39.4% of the current demand (In the year 2020).

	abstract = {The Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) is Ethiopia's poverty reduction strategy that forms the most important pillar of the country's agricultural transformation into a more productive and competitive sector. However, the extent to which the PSNP is linked to agriculture is unclear. This paper evaluates the impact of the PSNP on a range of agricultural outcomes. We use data from the Living Standard Measurement Study—Integrated Survey on Agriculture and apply the targeted maximum likelihood estimation method. We find no evidence that PSNP participation improved technology adoption, time spent in agriculture, household-level access to agricultural services, or women's control over agricultural assets. However, PSNP participation increased access to credit, the share of non-farm income, hours spent on casual work, community access to irrigation water, ownership of agricultural tools, community service in crop and livestock production, natural resource management, and access to credit. We also observe that PSNP households have a lower level of endowments compared to non-PSNP households. Given the observed lack of impact on household-level agricultural outcomes, we recommend integrating household-level interventions, such as increasing the transfer size and provision of productive assets, that could lift household endowments above an asset threshold that would allow the productive use of community assets. This may boost the productive impact of the PSNP at the household level, facilitate agricultural development and economic growth. To generate additional insights, we recommend further research with sufficient data on the causal pathways between safety nets and agriculture. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {As farmers in semiarid climates seek new ways of adding value to their operations, those with irrigation water rights are increasingly receptive to payments, or credits, for water sharing. Yet, past research on the economic feasibility of limited irrigation strategies for consumptive use (CU) savings seldom considers production risk. Using stochastic dominance, we compare the effect of three limited irrigation practices—deficit irrigation, root zone drying, and early crop maturity—on the returns to corn production for sprinkler and subsurface technology. Field-level simulations show that the practices reduce returns and increase risk, but credits for CU savings could make them economically viable for farmers. Larger credits (more money) incentivize limited irrigation at greater levels (less yield and more risk), but fully compensating farmers for risk-bearing will be costly. With sprinkler technology, root zone drying becomes risk-efficient at lower credit values than deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation along with root zone drying become risk-efficient at the lowest credit values for subsurface technology. Thus, risk aversion could explain why some farmers choose not to share water even when credits are large enough, on average, to compensate for differences in expected returns. Improved knowledge about the profitability and risk of limited irrigation practices can increase the joint sustainability of irrigated agriculture and other societal water uses. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {This research studies prediction models for optical water properties, which are very important to save time consumption to easy control of irrigation systems to make it smart irrigation systems and changing manual system with automatic systems, moreover the suitable time to implement maintenance. One of the most important reasons to use a regression model in this study is to have the ability to use a simple laser device to measure one optical parameter or physical parameters to predict the other parameters by regression models, which will save more money used by an expensive laser device to measure the three optical properties (reflection, transmission, and absorption). Data collected through laboratory experiments were then put through various machine learning regression models. The applied models are random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machine (SVR), and multiple linear regression (MLR). Four scenarios implemented these models; the first scenario included [pressure difference (Bar), wavelength (nm), total suspended solids (TSS)] for samples of Water taken from the filtration system, the second scenario included (Bar, nm, TSS, and reflection), the third scenario included (Bar, nm, TSS and transmission). The fourth scenario is (Bar, nm, TSS, transmission, and reflection). The findings of this research were SVR in scenario 3 (SVR3) had a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.95) and minimum error, followed by MLR in scenario 3 (MLR3) and scenario 2 (MLR2), which had the same correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.95), but errors were higher than SVR3. The lowest root means square error (RMSE) was in SVR in scenario 1 (SVR1) by 0.180, followed by RF in scenario 1 (RF1) by 0.181, and the highest was in RF in scenario 2 (RF 2) by 15.2. Based on these performance criteria, SVR3 is the best model to predict optical properties in this study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {An integrated hydro-economic agricultural land use model was developed with endogenous and spatially explicit crop planting, nitrogen (N) fertilizer use and irrigation in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB). We used the model to quantify the effects of energy and N fertilizer prices on N runoff to the Gulf of Mexico. Results show a modest effect of energy costs and a more substantive impact of N fertilizer costs on N delivered to the Gulf of Mexico. A 30 % reduction (increase) in N fertilizer price leads to a 3.5 % and 1.5 % increase (2.9 % and 1.5 % decrease) in N use and runoff, respectively. The model was also used to estimate the opportunity cost of N runoff abatement. The opportunity cost of reducing N runoff from crop production to the Gulf by 45 % is estimated to be $6 billion annually, which corresponds to an average cost of $29.3 per kg of N runoff reduction. The results show heterogeneities in the optimal N runoff reduction efforts across counties within the MRB, demonstrating the significance of a targeted abatement strategy. © 2021},

Use for this purpose total of 300 HHs was selected using the Multi-stage sampling technique. The collected data was analyzed using econometrics model. In the econometric part, a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model was applied to estimate households’ mean willingness to pay and its determinant’s for efficient irrigation water use. Leads by a double bounded dichotomous choice method. From seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model regression results, the mean and aggregate willingness to pay off the households 950.7 ETB (€25.7) per month per household per hectare was 1087159.09 ETB (€29382.7) per month and (12*1087159.09 = 13045909.08 ETB per year) respectively. The Mean and aggregate willingness to pay from the open-ended questions to be 926.059 ETB (€25.03) per month per household per hectare was 1072990.52 ETB (€28,999.74) per month respectively also, The bivariate probit model result revealed that bid values, sex of the household head, irrigation farm size, extension service significantly affected households’ WTP in both initial and followed up bid values So, policymakers should be households have a high willingness to pay for improved irrigation water use systems and the government should implement irrigation water management practices to supply reliable irrigation water to the farmers and should set up proper irrigation water pricing at an amount close to the mean WTP that households were willing and able to pay. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Climate-induced floods are increasing in Africa. The need to evolve framework for adaptation to climate change impact (CCI) among flood-prone fish farmers necessitated this study. Based on availability, 60 farming active flood-experienced fish farmers were purposively selected from flood-prone (Gulu and Kibuku) regions in climate hotspot Uganda. These were assessed for CCI adaptation tendencies in their socioeconomics and farming operation/techniques (FOI) indices, CCI awareness, CCI adaptation strategies, and perceived required interventions (RIs) using structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed through descriptive and multivariate regression tools. Respondents were mostly male, adults, educated, Christian, married, medium-sized family, social group members, 1–5 years’ experience, medium-sized farms, and government trained. Income was 1.0–6.0 million Ugx/year. In FOI, semi-intensive culture system, use of rainwater plus groundwater, small-sized (< 0.5 ha) ponds, ponds possession of inlets and outlets, seasonal farming and mixed culture/farming dominated. Most respondents were aware of CCI, while erratic rainfall with floods and prolonged drought mostly impacted farming. AS-Adaptation Strategy were changed stocking time and livelihood diversification. Communication technology and social group’s membership enhanced adaptation, while inadequate awareness constrains adaptation. Respondents’ RI(s) were tree planting, irrigation and pond perimeter trenching. Gender, government training, farm size, water sources and presence of inlet and outlets in ponds (FOI) predicted adaptation (R = 0.802, R2 = 0.64, P < 0.05). Some socioeconomic, technical and awareness indices could assist CCI flexibility. However, the statistically significant predictors of adaptation, identified adaptive strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions could be integrated into a framework for effective CCI adaptation for sustainable fish farming in flood-prone scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Dam construction is mostly aimed for multiple functions, including irrigation water provision, hydropower, and some others that bring substantial social benefits. However, global warming impacts on the interaction of the positive outcomes of damming remain little known, particularly in terms of the sustainability of their co-benefits, whereby investigating the different impacts of global warming scenarios of 1.5 °C and 2 °C has been a hotspot in water resources and energy research worldwide. This study used an integrative analysis based on a hydrological, techno-economic and agricultural modeling framework to evaluate the effects of global warming scenarios of 1.5 °C and 2 °C on the co-benefits between hydropower and irrigation in the Mekong River basin. The results show the declined hydropower generation and irrigation water supply in the Mekong River basin under 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming scenarios. The co-benefits between the hydropower and the irrigation is more undermined by the global warming of 2 °C relative to 1.5 °C in the Mekong River basin. Moreover, the changes of co-benefits are sensitive to the consideration of the protected areas in the basin. With the consideration of the protected areas, the co-benefits would be enhanced by 2 °C global warming compared to 1.5 °C global warming. Therefore, it is critical for decision-makers to consider the tradeoffs between the environment and dam construction for ensuring energy and food security under global warming scenarios. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Like other low-income countries in Asia and Africa, Nepal still suffers from food insecurity with a large proportion of food-insecure households being smallholder farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihood. Contributing factors include a lack of production, lack of resources, access to land and market, climate change, extreme events and underlying poverty. In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence, cause of and response to food insecurity and assess how food security varies with respect to the regional variation. We also explored the role of changing climatic conditions in creating such adversities. Based on an analysis of the results from interviewing 384 farm households from three agro-ecological zones in Bagmati Province, we found that 56% of the farm households experienced food insecurity. The severity varied amongst the households with resource-poor, disadvantaged groups and those with limited land and income suffering the most severely from food insecurity. Households in the Mountains and the Hills zones were more food insecure than in the Terai zone. Climate change impacts were found to have amplified the risks of food insecurity amongst these rural households surviving under a largely subsistence agrarian economy. The results further suggest that the adaptive capacities of smallholder households can be increased by improving agricultural productivity through providing skills and training, better access to markets, extension services, credit and insurance schemes, along with access to climate-smart technologies, micro-irrigation, improved infrastructure, and storage facilities. Support from relevant governmental and non-governmental organizations is needed to help smallholder households, and their communities better manage the risks to their food security. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of crop diversification in increasing the income of farm households. In addition, this study introduces the impact of natural disasters in the analysis to determine how diversification helps mitigate the negative effect of disasters on farm income. More importantly, the study also analyses the effect of diversification on farm income by farm class to see where the benefits of diversification are concentrated. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a linear model, in which agricultural income is expressed as a function of diversification, natural disasters and several control variables. Diversification is measured using the Simpson index of diversification. The linear model is enhanced with the inclusion of an interaction term of natural disasters with the diversification index to shed light on the role of diversification in negating their harmful effect on agricultural income. Finally, to analyze the impact of institutional variables on farm income, the interactions of diversification with irrigation, insurance, usage of technical information and formal training are incorporated in the linear model. Findings: The study highlights the importance of demographic, farm and institutional variables in raising farm income. The study suggests that an increase in education level, irrigation, usage of technical information and possession of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) have a positive impact on agricultural income. The study reveals that crop diversification has a positive impact on farm income and the benefits of diversification are conditioned by institutional factors. Thus, there is a need for policy intervention to ensure increased irrigation facilities along with extension services to provide information to the farm households. It has been found that small farmers gain more from crop diversification than larger farmers. Furthermore, the results show that natural disasters negatively impact farm income, but their impact can be mitigated by higher levels of diversification. Originality/value: The results of the study are based on the recent unit-level data from the 77th Round of the National Sample Survey Office survey. The survey covers a large number of farm households and reports information for the year 2018–2019. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The long-term trends indicate that the area between latitude 25 and 28° N has been more exposed to adverse climatic changes especially rise in maximum summer/monsoon and minimum winter temperatures. The more predominant correlates of vulnerability in the region come not from the exposure to adverse meteorological conditions but from prevailing socio-economic conditions (adaptive capacity) and the increased environmental pressure (sensitivity). Among the top 40 most vulnerable districts in the TUGP, in about two-third, the exposure was at moderate to low level, but sensitivity was high and adaptive capacity very weak. Among the sensitivity indicators, the factor loadings, obtained through modified principal component technique, were high for average size of landholdings, Temperature Humidity Index load and productivity of paddy and wheat crops. Irrigation intensity, farm mechanization, cropping intensity, livestock density, proportion of milch animals stock, rural literacy rate and veterinary institutions were the critical factors in determining the adaptive capacity of a district.

To date, however, there has been a failure to integrate accounting information systems with on-farm data, despite today's farmers facing unprecedented and interconnected economic and resource pressures. This study explores this problem in more detail, defines the objectives of the solution and develops a model of integrated accounting and agricultural information systems, drawing on a ‘fads and fashions’ framework and advancing our understanding of bundled innovations. Using data from a participatory case study in Australian potato farming, the study integrates accounting data with soil moisture and climate data to track, alert and inform irrigation decisions. Development of preliminary digital software based on the model demonstrates how cost-informed tracking, alerts and forecasting can be supported by bundling accounting information systems and sensing technology. In doing so, the model extends the fads and fashions framework for agricultural information systems and demonstrates how accounting information can be the key for improved water productivity, profitability and agricultural sustainability. © 2021},

The ESR model accounts for selectivity bias associated with observed and unobserved factors. We find that agri-value chain participation improves vegetable farmers' welfare. Participation significantly increases household income and consumption expenditure by about 22% and 40%, respectively. Our results also reveal that agri-value chain participation is significantly determined by education, household size, mobile phone ownership, irrigation, farm size, farmer group membership, and extension visits.

	abstract = {Irrigation represents a long-standing water sector investment in South East Asia. However, despite the undeniable benefits of food production, an irrigation/rice-centric strategy is insufficient in a multi-dimensional conceptualisation of development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenge us to re-think traditional ways of achieving food security. Central to this challenge is how we can retain multi-functionality within landscapes. We explore the often negatively correlated relationship between irrigation and inland fisheries through a literature review and interviews with key informants, focusing on examples from Myanmar and Cambodia. We found that whilst technical options exist for minimizing irrigation impacts on fisheries, there is a fundamental disconnect between the technical application of such ‘solutions’, and distribution of benefits to the marginal groups that SDGs 1, 2, 3 and more target. We found that insufficient recognition of the social contexts in which solutions are applied underpins this disconnect. This means that technical infrastructure design needs to be organised around the question, ‘Who do we want to benefit?’, if investments are to go beyond rice/fish production and deliver more on socially inclusive food security and livelihood opportunities. This paper is a call to extend the framing and financing of irrigation investments beyond technical parameters to include investing in the social processes that enable both multi-functionality and inclusive growth, to enhance the role of irrigation in adapting to a changing climate, while maintaining landscape integrity and multi-functionality so necessary for a sustainable future. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The decline in Urmia Lake basin’s water resources has resulted in a severe drought of the lake. The drought of this hyper-saline lake has put lives of 6.4 million inhabitants at risk. This study was conducted to assess the technical and economic employability of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) method as a policy tool to improve water resources management of Siminehroud river basin which is the most important tributary of Urmia Lake basin. For this purpose, the target areas were identified after the development of a land-use map for the basin. Then, by recruiting the integrated interview method and distributing 398 questionnaires, the required data were collected to assess the employability of the proposed PES method. Among various PES schemes, two methods including a) payment for shifting irrigation methods and b) payment to change cropping patterns in the frame of “Willingness to Accept” (WTA) were proposed to farmers. The results suggest that farmers highly welcomed both proposed methods. The benefit–cost ratio (BCR) for the change in irrigation system was 3.98, whereas the changes for the cropping pattern were 0.8 (for rapeseed), 0.72 (for soybean), and 1.09 (for safflower). As a result, shifting irrigation methods and changing cultivation patterns to safflower are both economically justifiable. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

It has been argued that besides giving farmers an additional and reliable source of income, grid-connected SIPs also incentivise efficient energy and water use-critical for sustaining groundwater irrigation. The Surya Raitha scheme was the country's first, state-driven initiative for solarisation of agriculture feeders by replacing subsidy-guzzling, inefficient electric pumps with energy-efficient, net-metered SIPs. An early appraisal of Surya Raitha lauded the scheme as a smart initiative and argued that it could set an example for promoting solar power as a remunerative crop. However, the scheme was eventually executed as a single feeder pilot with some design changes in Nalahalli panchayat from 2015-18. The authors visited the pilot in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to assess if it had delivered the promises of Surya Raitha scheme.

Twenty-two different interventions are considered for reducing undernourishment relying on information drawn from best available evidence-based literature, including model- and large-scale intervention studies. Ending hunger by 2030 would require annual investments of about US$ 39 to 50 billion until 2030 to lift about 840 to 909 million people out of hunger, which is the 2020 estimate of hunger projection in 2030, also considering the effects of COVID-19. Investing in agricultural R&D, agricultural extension services, ICT - Agricultural information systems, small-scale irrigation expansion in Africa and female literacy improvement are low cost options that have a relatively large hunger-reduction potential. To achieve the goal of ending hunger by 2030, not only is it urgent not to lose any more time, but also to optimally phase investments. Investments that have more long-term impacts should be frontloaded in the decade in order to reap their benefits soon before 2030. A balanced approach is needed to reach the hungry soon – including those adversely affected by COVID-19 with social protection and nutrition programs. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Increasing the yield of oilseeds is considered an important plan and strategy in different countries such as Iran. With limited available arable land, boosting the cultivation of oilseeds should involve increasing per unit area. Therefore, narrowing the yield gap (YG) and optimizing agricultural practices/inputs can be the efficient strategies for improving food security and mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture. For this purpose, the boundary line analysis (BLA) was integrated with the life cycle assessment (LCA) in this study to survey 301 soybean farms. BLA analysis calculated attainable yield and YG as 4437 and 1972 kg ha−1, respectively. According to the results, the BLA improved the efficient use of resources and attenuated environmental hazards by exploring the causes of YG and optimizing farm practices, something which was confirmed by the LCA and the ReCiPe2016 model. For instance, optimization of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur fertilizers resulted in reduction rates of 44%, 45%, 87%, and 56% the in global warming potential, respectively. As a result of the BLA-optimized tillage operations, the impacts of mineral resource scarcity and freshwater eutrophication were reduced by 15% and 16%, respectively. In addition, a reduction rate of 52% was also observed in the water use impact category due to the optimal irrigation frequencies, i.e., 1–3 times. Moreover, diesel fuel and fertilizers are the primary sources of environmental damage. Eventually, tillage optimization and fertilization should be first taken into account in order to produce larger amounts of healthier food by bridging the YG.

We studied the association between rural livelihood capitals (natural, human, social, financial, and physical) and resilience to water scarcity. Resilience was denoted by farmers’ self-reported capacity to have avoided, or adapted to, water scarcity. Proxies for livelihood capitals were collected from two-hundred farmers in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and their associations with a typology denoting water scarcity impacts analyzed with a Taylor-linearized multinomial response model. Physical and natural assets in the form of irrigation infrastructure and direct access to water sources were saliently associated with overall resilience (avoidance and adaptation) to water scarcity. Years of farming experience as a form of human capital asset was also strongly associated with resilience to water scarcity. Factors solely associated with the capacity to adapt to water scarcity were more nuanced with social capital assets showing closer associations. A household with a larger number of farm laborers had a higher likelihood of being unable to withstand water scarcity, but this relationship was reversed among those who managed larger farming areas. We discuss possible mechanisms that could have contributed to resilience, and how public policy could support smallholder farmers cope with water scarcity. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Effects of a changing climate on agricultural system productivity are poorly understood, and likely to be met with as yet undefined agricultural adaptations by farmers and associated business and governmental entities. The continued vitality of agricultural systems depends on economic conditions that support farmers’ livelihoods. Exploring the long-term effects of adaptations requires modeling agricultural and economic conditions to engage stakeholders upon whom the burden of any adaptation will rest. Here, we use a new freeware model FEWCalc (Food-Energy-Water Calculator) to project farm incomes based on climate, crop selection, irrigation practices, water availability, and economic adaptation of adding renewable energy production. Thus, FEWCalc addresses United Nations Global Sustainability Goals No Hunger and Affordable and Clean Energy. Here, future climate scenario impacts on crop production and farm incomes are simulated when current agricultural practices continue so that no agricultural adaptations are enabled. The model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) with added arid-region dynamics is used to simulate agricultural dynamics. Demonstrations at a site in the midwest USA with 2008–2017 historical data and two 2018–2098 RCP climate scenarios provide an initial quantification of increased agricultural challenges under climate change, such as reduced crop yields and increased financial losses. Results show how this finding is largely driven by increasing temperatures and changed distribution of precipitation throughout the year. Without effective technological advances and operational and policy changes, the simulations show how rural areas could increasingly depend economically on local renewable energy, while agricultural production from arid regions declines by 50% or more. © 2020},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the drivers of marketing channel participation amongst smallholder rice farmers in the northern region of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 397 smallholder rice farmers drawn from a multistage sampling procedure, the study employed multivariate probit (MVP) model in the empirical estimations. In this context, the model assumes that a rice farmer should at least participate in one market channel. Findings: The study reveals that the wholesaler market channel is the most commonly used channel among farmers, followed by the aggregator channel. However, the processor market channel is the least patronized one in the study area. The results also show statistically significant correlation coefficients in four out of the six possible combinations, implying that market channel participation among smallholder farmers is not mutually exclusive. Rice market channel participation is positively and significantly influenced by age, gender, household headship, access to credit, extension service, irrigation, improved seed and access to price information. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited in extending the analysis to include the impact of market channels on some outcome measures. This is due to data limitation. Originality/value: The findings of this study add to the growing literature on smallholder market channel participation in Ghana. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Mountains cover approximately three quarters of the Vietnam, mainly in the north, west, and central parts of the country. Among the 38 ethnic minorities inhabiting the northern mountains of Vietnam, the Thai population is the second largest. Cultural landscapes and traditional agricultural uplands shaped by the Thai have a long history and represent a mosaic of paddy and vegetable fields along rivers and springs, forests and plantations of trees on slopes. This pattern is now changing significantly, which results in a diversification of the fields shaped by Thai farmers. This study deals with understanding the pressures driving the changes, the new state of the upland agriculture, and the way the Thai of the Son Thinh mountain (Yen Bai, Vietnam) respond to sustain their upland farming systems. Land quality indicators (LQIs) are identified using the pressure–state–response (PSR) framework. Sixty completed questionnaires with 65 closed questions each using a five-point Likert scale were collected in 2016. The results show that Thai farmers nowadays apply a wider-scale solutions to deal with the sustainability of agricultural upland on the slopes as compared to a limited number of traditional farming techniques that were used in the past. Climate change hazards (floods, droughts, landslides, extreme cold, and flash floods), the scarcity of irrigation water, and agricultural land put pressure on the slopes. The most noticeable socioeconomic impacts are migration, population growth, and unstable input and output prices. The most considerable changes in the state of the land quality are soil erosion, land degradation, and local cultivation practices. Modifying cultivation options, applying soil conservation practices, improving indigenous techniques, and implementing agricultural land use policies are the most significant responses to modify land use and its pressures. Responses of the Thai farmers on sustainable sloping land use are put in a structural model with a horizontal diversification strategy. Recommendations concern mainstreaming the local indigenous knowledge on agricultural land use, land management policies, and implementing the LQIs based on PSR framework for sustainable land use planning on the slopes in Vietnam. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Irrigation farming is increasing been used as a strategy in Ethiopia. However, lack of consensus on the role of the irrigation sector on the welfare of smallholder farmers and pitfalls in impact study methodologies resulted in mixed findings. This study evaluated the impact of Awash irrigation on the welfare of rural smallholder farmers. Two-stage stratified sampling technique employed to select sample households. Cross-sectional household level data from a survey of 315; 165 irrigation users and 151 non-users smallholder farmers in Asiyta district, Ethiopia used for the analysis. This study employed endogenous switching regression model to control for endogeneity problems associated with adoption decision. Accordingly, the correlation coefficient result proved that the existence of self-selection and endogeneity. Results indicated, irrigation users’ per capita consumption expenditure and income were 16 percent and 35 percent, respectively, higher compared to non-irrigation-users significantly. Endogenous switching regression model further identified amount of own land cultivated, education status, number of extension contact, livestock holding, nearest market distance, access to non-farm job and nearest canal distance significantly determine irrigation participation. The study concluded that Awash irrigation is one of the viable solutions to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers in the study area. Therefore, governmental and non-governmental organization should promote, improve and expand Awash irrigation in all areas of the Woreda in particular and irrigation agriculture in general.

	abstract = {The relevance of this study is conditioned by the current findings on salicylic acid (SA) synthesis in plants, which suggest that the presence of some transient factors in cotton is a signal that the stress-protective functions of the plant are being activated. An increase in the content of key mediators of the defence signalling system in cotton cells triggers the activation of stress factors, triggering the defence mechanisms of the living organism. Thus, the resistance of plants to certain types of abiotic stress is achieved by activating the protective reactions of the signalling system. This process allows for the targeted use of biologically active substances such as salicylic acid. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the combined properties of the protective signalling system of some genetic types of cotton plants, when phenolic acids are synthesised in them. The leading approach to the study of this issue is a laboratory experiment, which allowed comprehensively considering cotton lines containing RNA sensitive to certain types of abiotic stress. Additional biological and chemical techniques were used as auxiliary methods in the field to test the specific effects of saline soils on cotton RNA salicylic acid concentration. This study presents data on the resistance of the RNA interference (RNAi) genotype ESKIMO1 to salinity and limited irrigation. The content of salicylic acid in cotton tissues under the influence of various concentrations of NaCl was studied. The formation of reactive oxygen species in the process of activation of plant defence reactions to certain types of abiotic stress is substantiated. The study materials are of practical value to microbiologists, geneticists, and agronomists. The investigation of the biotechnological features of the plant genotype plays an important role in understanding plant adaptation to natural conditions caused by certain types of abiotic stress. The affordability of salicylic acid allows its widespread application as a commercial reagent in crop production practices. Copyright © The Author(s).

In lottery villages, we find evidence of displacement of private fertilizer and of a secondary market as beneficiaries are more likely to sell inputs to non-beneficiaries. In contrast, in non-lottery villages we find no evidence of displacement nor of elite capture.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of social capital with bonding and bridging distinction in promoting higher participation in collective action in participatory irrigation management. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 304 farmers was surveyed using a structured questionnaire. A focus group discussion was also carried out with randomly selected water users, leaders and irrigation officers. A confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the hypothesised relationship of bonding and bridging social capital towards collective action. Findings: The findings show that social capital has a significant direct effect on collective action and an indirect effect on joint irrigation management's perceived performance through collective action (mediator). It implies the need to complement the participatory irrigation management programme with an understanding of the social aspects for a higher farmer's participation over the shared resource. Originality/value: The paper emphasises social capital's role in facilitating a real participatory engagement in shared resource management. Also, it is the first scholarly work linking social capital with bonding and bridging distinction towards collective action in a joint resource management context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Fossil fuel and electricity-based irrigation practices contribute to greenhouse gases and add substantial costs to water access. Solar-powered irrigation is spreading globally, notably in developing countries, as a solution to the rising energy and climate concerns related to agriculture. This policy perspective devoted to examining the impact of the solar irrigation facilities (SIF) adoption on irrigation cost and return on investment (ROI) based on seven years of panel data seeks to contribute to the efforts to propel solar irrigation toward delivering on the myriad of promises. Methods: Panel logistic regression was employed to analyze adoption determinants, while adoption impact was evaluated through the propensity score matching with the difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) method. In addition, the time and panel fixed effect DID and doubly robust DID model was also used for robustness check. Results: The result reveals that SIF adoption significantly increased ROI by 20% to 30% and reduced irrigation costs by 21% to 30%. Conclusion: The findings call for further research and analysis on evidence-based best practices for solar irrigation solutions at the farm level so that the dissemination of this revolutionary technology, apart from contributing to the advancement of the energy sector, also plays a vital role in driving us towards establishing a more equitable and sustainable world.

The geographical setting is the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a main water hub in California, where salinity is a significant part of recent policy debates over water management and infrastructure. We use highly granular farm-level panel data on Delta farming activity to estimate two sets of response parameters using (i) standard (fixed coefficients) logit model, and (ii) a mixed (random coefficient) logit model. The mixed logit results provide evidence for heterogeneity in supply response across farmers. To put these findings in a meaningful economic context, we use the results from both models to simulate estimates for aggregate acreage responses under two alternative salinity scenarios. We implement a method to simulate individual specific responses together with their confidence intervals, which provides additional insight into the composition of farmer heterogeneity. Based on these post-regression simulation results, we find the mixed logit model predicts an elasticity of aggregate acreage for salt-sensitive (hence higher value) crops that is an order of magnitude larger compared to that of the standard fixed coefficients logit method. This result sheds light on category of costs likely to increase in response to rising salinity in the Delta region. © 2021 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association.},

	abstract = {The integral development of agriculture and tourism heavily depends on natural resources, especially agricultural resources, and it also may contribute to the sustainability of agriculture. The sustainability of agriculture is usually measured by the agricultural eco-efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the impact of the agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural eco-efficiency, so as to reflect the role of the agriculture and tourism integration on promoting agricultural sustainability. Applying panel data of 19 provinces in Yangtze River Basin and Yellow River Basin in China from 2008 to 2019, this paper uses a PSTR model to demonstrate the impact of agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural eco-efficiency and its mechanisms. It is found that in the study area, the integration of agriculture and tourism can contribute to improvements in agricultural eco-efficiency, and when levels of integration are high, the promotional effect is enhanced. However, impacts vary among different regions to some extent. In terms of influencing mechanisms, inputs of agricultural labor, sown crop area, effective irrigation area and other factors decrease with continuous improvements of integration. The input of pesticides, fertilizers and other factors does not decrease in the initial stage of integration but undergoes a rapid decrease after crossing a threshold value. And it demonstrates that the integration of agriculture and tourism is beneficial for improving the agricultural eco-efficiency, so that it will contribute to agricultural sustainability. Meanwhile, this paper offers a new research perspective for discovering effects of agriculture and tourism integration, providing implications for formulating regional policies for the integration. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Governments in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are keen to expand irrigation to improve food security and are placing particular emphasis on adoption and use of smallholder private groundwater irrigation. Yet private irrigation is a multi-stage technology, the adoption of which is affected by fiscal support and extension services offered on different investment stages but also by uncertainties around actions that need to be undertaken in these stages. Groundwater-based irrigation in Ethiopia presents a case where policy has focused on fiscally easing the purchase of pumps while considerable ambiguity (unquantifiable uncertainty) exists around the outcomes of drilling boreholes (reaching water). In this paper, we examine farmers’ willingness to adopt smallholder private irrigation packages in response to lower pump prices following tax breaks, loan availability, and reduction in ambiguities related to borehole drilling, using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in two districts of Ethiopia. The results indicate that the provision of loans and reduction in ambiguities related to well drilling have the greatest effect on the probability of farmers adopting irrigation packages. Lowering pump prices has the smallest effect. Pump-type has a small effect, with energized pumps preferred over manual ones. In exploring heterogeneity in preferences, we find that farmers without irrigated plots and those with greater market access have a greater preference for the provision of loans, while those with greater market access also have greater preferences for reductions in well drilling ambiguities. The results of this choice experiment suggest that reducing ambiguities around well drilling (initial investments) is an essential and cost-effective step toward expanding groundwater-based irrigation in Ethiopia. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Our findings document that the world's second-largest rice exporter could produce 4 million tonnes more rice with the same water supply in the reasonably achievable case of 20 per cent SRI uptake across its provinces. In addition, we find that SRI also increases the output of other crops, due at least partly to its possible water savings and soil nutrition preservation in rice production. Moreover, we show that SRI is more likely to be adopted in provinces with a stronger quality of provincial institutions and a weaker agricultural capital base. Numerous selectivity and randomisation tests affirm that the water productivity effect of SRI is robust to selection in SRI uptake at the province and district levels and addressing potential unobservable and omitted variable problems. © 2022 The Authors.

Digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are enabling the collection of vast amounts of geo-referenced information about growing conditions within the field, automated implementation of spatially varying input applications, and reduced reliance on chemical inputs. We discuss the pathways by which digital agricultural technologies have the potential to address the challenge of herbicide-resistant weeds, over-application of nitrogen and irrigation water, and cover crop planting for restoring soil health and contribute to the environmental sustainability of agriculture. Then, we discuss the economic factors, behavioral preferences of farmers, peer pressure, and social networks that can be expected to play a role in adoption decisions.

	abstract = {This paper empirically estimates the effects of infrastructure investments on the level and distribution of impoverished households' income, utilizing the arguably exogenous investment shock from the Targeted Poverty Alleviation program in China. We focus on the agricultural income of poor rural households. We also examine whether these infrastructure investments increase or decrease income inequality within the impoverished group. We distinguish among different types of infrastructure investment, aiming to identify the investments effective in promoting growth in agricultural income, especially for the poorest. Based on a comprehensive household-level administrative dataset and econometric analysis, we find that electricity infrastructure significantly increases poor households' agricultural income and that the income benefit is equally distributed among the poor; agricultural irrigation infrastructure raises agricultural income significantly and delivers more benefit to the poorest households. An examination of the mechanism shows that both electricity and irrigation infrastructure increase the probability of participating in agricultural work and therefore increase agricultural income. These findings imply that, through increasing the utilization of agricultural land and the labor of impoverished households, electricity and irrigation infrastructure investments in rural impoverished areas are likely to lead to pro-poor and sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Optimization of crop production inputs to reduce energy input and greenhouse gases emissions with maximizing economic productivity is needed to develop sustainable agriculture under groundwater-based irrigation conditions. This paper examined the effects of irrigated wheat tillage practices on energy indices, greenhouse gases emissions, and economic indices. Research treatments were conventional tillage and no-tillage (environment-friendly) systems in semi-arid environments. This study was conducted in wheat farms under groundwater-based irrigation, and data were monitored and collected for two years between 2012–2013 and 2013–2014. The results indicated that no-tillage practice had lower energy input (13%, 21.12 vs. 24.34 GJ ha−1), energy output (18%, 83.01 vs. 101.11 GJ ha−1), and energy use efficiency (7%), but higher energy productivity (19%) and indirect energy (9%) than conventional tillage practice. Moreover, no-tillage practice produced lower emissions of CO2 (24%, 830.28 vs. 1096.40 kg ha−1) and total global warming potential (GWP) (14%, 1830.03 vs. 2120.43 kg CO2-equivalents ha−1) than conventional tillage practice. In comparison, 53.9% of GWP originated from N2O and 45.4% from CO2. Inputs of electricity, diesel fuel, machinery, and nitrogen fertilizer had 95% contributions in emission from farms. Economically, no-tillage practice had higher productivity (3%, 7.06 vs. 6.86 kg US$−1) but lower net return (18%, 1076.52 vs. 1313.48 US$ ha−1) and benefit to cost ratio (14%, 3.10 vs. 3.61) than conventional tillage practice. However, producing wheat in this agroecosystem is profitable and beneficial under both tillage systems. It was concluded that the promising technique of the no-tillage under groundwater-based irrigation conditions significantly facilitated a cleaner production of wheat through managing energy with controlling greenhouse gases emissions in a semi-arid environment.

A multivariate probit (MVP) regression model was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices. The most frequently adopted strategies considered for analysis were manure application, increased pesticide use, crop rotation, irrigation, change of planting dates and terracing. The results reveal that land ownership, group membership, access to extension services and education level were some of the key drivers of adoption. This implies that policies and programmes that are designed to build the ability of smallholder AIV farmers to adapt to climate change should focus on organising farmers into groups, disseminating timely weather information, improving land tenure security, increasing off-farm employment and providing greater access to extension services. © 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland},

	abstract = {This study explores farmers' adjustments to their water use when faced with water restrictions, distinguishing between intensive and extensive adjustments and examining adaptation over time. Specifically, the study uses a difference-in-differences framework to explore the effect of a groundwater restriction on irrigation management strategies. In 1992, the Kansas Department of Agriculture created an Intensive Groundwater Use Control Area to improve streamflow in Walnut Creek, which feeds water to a highly important migration point on the mid-continent flyway. The program allocates permission to extract groundwater in 5-year allotments. The stringency of the program's restriction depends on the seniority of the water right. We find significant reductions in water use along the intensive margin for senior water rights and along both the intensive and extensive margins for junior water rights. The results indicate significant reductions in water use that imply negative welfare impacts on farmers. We also find evidence of dynamically optimal behavior within each 5-year allotment period. © 2023 The Authors.

This study investigates the factors that affect the tendency to adopt CPIS in Takestan County of Qazvin Province (Iran) over the years 2016–2017. The statistical population of this study includes farmers who use groundwater for irrigation in Takestan County (N = 1740). Of these farmers, 210 were selected as the sample size using Cochran formula, Chi-square, Phi and Cramer's V, and Lambda tests that were used to investigate the relationship between the proposed irrigation system adoption and different dependent variables. Seven research hypotheses were proposed and tested. Since there is a positive and significant relationship between all social communication features and the adoption of CPIS, it is, therefore, recommended that city officials provide more promotional/educational classes and necessary facilities to increase farmers’ acquaintance with new irrigation methods and raise their awareness about the benefits of such a participation in these schemes and programs. In doing so, there is a higher chance that farmers would cooperate to a greater degree in water management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This paper evaluates the potential productivity and water-saving benefits of smallholder drip irrigation by conducting a randomized control trial in Andhra Pradesh, India. A group of well-owners was offered a subsidy to adopt drip irrigation, while a comparable group acted as controls. After three years, the drip group shifted more into horticultural crops, enjoyed higher farm profit, and transferred (primarily through cash sales) more of its groundwater to adjacent plots. There is no difference in groundwater pumping, which is constrained by electricity rationing in this setting. The evidence thus suggests that drip adoption in South India, while increasing irrigation efficiency, will not save groundwater. © 2023},

	abstract = {The need for rainwater harvesting is continuously growing as a supplement to other water sources and the operation and maintenance costs remain low after the initial investment. The daily water balance method was used to determine the optimal rainwater harvesting tank size. Princeton Global Forcing (PGF) data gridded at (0.25° × 0.25°) is used after comparison with observed data. Correlations between PGF and observed stations varied by under or overestimating the precipitation. PGF series could ably reproduce observed rainfall, hence were used. The optimum water tank size varies based on the collection area, climatic conditions, and water pricing. According to the results, reliability is higher for larger rainwater tank sizes and higher for larger collections areas. Areas that receive more rainfall have higher reliabilities and require smaller tank sizes. Meeting 100% reliabilities requires collection areas greater than 500 m2 for demand of 750 L/day. Reliability was investigated for different tank volumes and an insignificant increase in reliability was observed for tank sizes greater than 50 m3. A roof collection area of at least 250 m2 and a tank size of 120 m3 and above is recommended to achieve more than 50% reliability. Installation of RWH systems is viable with a payback period of fewer than 4 years. The payback period is shorter for areas that receive high rainfall. The results in this study serve as a tool for comparison with other studies on evaluating the performance of rainwater harvesting systems and the possibility of using RWH systems beyond domestic and irrigation purposes. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The Snowball sampling technique was adopted to collect primary data from 50 farmers, each practising ARC and CRC. The per hectare gross returns were higher in CRC (₹1,16,827 per ha) compared to aerobic rice cultivation (₹1,00,664 per ha) since the grain yield was higher in CRC. The aerobic rice cultivation (ARC) was profitable as it generated higher net returns (₹24,653 per ha) compared to conventional paddy cultivation (₹11,046 per ha) because of the lower cost of cultivation. ARC was sustainable compared to the conventional method as resources were optimally used. In addition, ARC resulted in positive externality to the tune of ₹7714 per hectare over CRC. Human labour was the major cost component in both ARC and CRC. Among the costs inARC, human labour cost accounted for nearly 40 per cent because of the high labour requirement for weeding. The imputed irrigation cost was higher in CRC than in ARC, where water requirement was saved up to 63 per cent. The analysis revealed the superiority of ARC over CRC in terms of cost, net returns and positive externality. Hence, the study will help policymakers and stakeholders to promote the technology extensively. © 2022 The Society of Economics and Development, except certain content provided by third parties.},

	abstract = {Water used for irrigation is essential for global food production. Increased water scarcity, due to climate change, is a constraint to agricultural development, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. This increases pressure on agriculture which often manages water inefficiently and competes with other sectors for water use. Enhancing farmers’ production efficiency may lead to substantial water savings and conservation. Public sector is called to play a role in water governance and to introduce appropriate multilevel regulatory and incentive measures for better water management. This work applies a spatial stochastic frontier model to the case of high water-demanding fruit and vegetable crops in the Apulia region of Southern Italy, where water is scarce due to semi-arid climate and erratic rainfall. Using cross-sectional data from the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network, this work incorporates firm specific heterogeneity into technical efficiency analysis and implements an autoregressive specification of the inefficiency component. Results support the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity exists in on-farm efficiency of irrigated crop production and is adequately captured by the spatial stochastic frontier model approach. Technical efficiency of farms with similar structural and management characteristics greatly varies across crops and geographical areas, because of the different natural resource endowment and agro-climatic factors. Policies providing incentives to on-farm adoption of modern water-saving technologies and measures to promote small family farm activities could effectively contribute to water conservation goal, but they should be well-articulated to account for agriculture spatial diverseness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We approach these questions by testing two processes of trust formation: particularized trust built on repeated interactions of rational individuals and generalized trust based on arational habits. To identify the causal relationship between farmers’ irrigation infrastructure access and trust, we conducted an incentivized trust game with beneficiaries of the irrigated land settlement program in rural Sri Lanka, where land allocation was arguably random. Two findings emerged. First, trust among community members monotonically increases with each farmer's years of access to irrigation, regardless of social relationships. Second, the nexus between irrigation access years and trust does not necessarily differ between in-group and out-group members. These findings suggest the relative significance of generalized trust formation by habits in irrigated communities, although we cannot fully rule out the possible particularized trust formation through repeated interactions. Since generalized trust is essential to facilitate market transactions, our finding is especially relevant when formulating infrastructure investment policies in developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

First, an extended ordered probit model was estimated to analyze the impact of technology choice sets on food consumption groups (poor, limit and acceptable).

The results show that the adoption of multiple technologies increases food consumption and reduces poverty among agricultural households in Benin. Combinations of technologies that enhance both food consumption and poverty status are irrigation and herbicide, irrigation and chemical fertilizers and improved seed and chemical fertilizers.

	abstract = {Groundwater is the major primary source of drinking and irrigation water for nearly 500 million inhabitants in both rural and urban areas of the Ganga Alluvial Plain (GAP) in India. Indiscriminate pumping of groundwater primarily from the shallow parts of the alluvial aquifer system is leading to rapid decline in water tables. It is expected that in coming years, the stress on groundwater will only increase due to steadily rising urbanization and additional demands for water and land, as well as by impending weather anomalies and shifts in availability of water during seasons when demands for irrigation and ecological needs are high. In the present study, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method is used using pre- and post-monsoon groundwater levels from 764 observatory wells and peizometers to assess the trends of declining groundwater in the Gomti River Basin (GRB) during 2005 to 2015. Groundwater potential zone maps were composed using water depths data and Cartosat-1 satellite images delineating the area under rising and falling groundwater tables. The loss of shallow groundwater was clearly visible during the 2005–2015 periods. The decline is attributed to intensive irrigation from groundwater as well as peri-urban growth around the state capital.

	abstract = {Over-exploitation of groundwater in China has severely affected irrigation agriculture, especially in the North China Plain, and it also threatens the environment. Although water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been introduced for decades, sustained commitment to WST is not being met. This paper investigates factors affecting adoption and sustained adoption of WST based on 261 households in the North China Plain. We employ Heckman’s two-stage sample selection process: (1) households decide whether to adopt WST or not and (2) households decide whether to sustainably adopt (adopt for a long time) WST or not. Particular attention is paid to the role of water scarcity in the initial adoption and sustained adoption stages. Several indicators relating to water scarcity are used to calculate a water scarcity index based on principal component analysis. The results showed that water scarcity exerts a significant and positive effect on both adoption and sustained adoption of WST. Non-adopters and non-sustained adopters face less severe water scarcity than adopters. Membership in cooperative organizations significantly improves the likelihood of sustained adoption; 63.6% of sustained adopters have a membership in cooperative organizations, compared with 18.2% of non-sustained adopters. The number of plots negatively affects the sustained adoption of WST; sustained adopters on average have 3.0 plots, and non-sustained adopters have 5.3 plots. Education, extension service, farm size, off-farm work, relatives working in the local government and irrigation costs are positively and significantly associated with adoption and sustained adoption decisions. Finally, we find that labor-saving capacity significantly influences both stages, whereas capital-saving capacity is only significant in the adoption stage. Only 10% of non-adopters consider adoption of WST as more labor- and capital-saving than conventional irrigation practices, in comparison with nearly 50% of adopters. These results imply that the extension of WST should consider focusing more on cooperative organizations and hold more demonstrations for farmers. Moreover, given that the degree of water shortage varies from region to region, the WST extension standards should vary accordingly. Governments should strengthen awareness by enhancing education and publicity concerning water scarcity and conservation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Intensification of agriculture has challenged environmental sustainability in the form of contaminated water resources, particularly due to the irrational use of synthetic fertilizers. The strong relationship between yield and fertilizer use has led farmers to overrule the systematic approach of fertilizer application. Although various measures have been applied to understand the farmers’ decision-making regarding fertilizer application rates, its excessive use, however, remains inexplicable. To understand this decision-making process, the study attempts to assess the farmers’ fertilizer use behaviour using a socio-psychological model based on available resources, prevailing socio-economic conditions and personal aspects of users in Uttar Pradesh region of India. A survey study was conducted on 312 farmers, categorized by differential land holdings. Regression analysis results indicated that among the series of variables, variables, viz. lack of eco-efficient fertilizers, access to irrigation, credit facilities, use of available cash, farming experience and farm size, are critical ones for determining the fertilizer use decision of farmers. The outcome of the study argues that sustainable interventions in agriculture facilitate the management of natural resource base as global consequences of over-consumption of nitrogen fertilizer particularly have challenged the capacity of natural resources, viz. soil and water. This research work suggests the need for site-specific tailor-made policy measures which can be instrumental in mitigating environmental externality resulting from mismanaged farm practices like excessive use of fertilizers. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The study utilizes nationally representative farm survey data from India and applies a multinomial endogenous switching regression technique to estimate these measures' relative income and risk benefits. Four key findings have emerged from this analysis. First, farmers' decisions on risk management and adaptation measures are influenced by the historical exposure to climatic shocks, resource endowments, institutional credit and social safety nets for food security and employment. Second, crop insurance and irrigation improve farm income and reduce farmers' exposure to downside risk. Third, the income and risk benefits are bigger in the case of their joint adoption. Fourth, there is spatial heterogeneity in the benefits of these—crop insurance is relatively more effective at higher levels of rainfall, while the converse is true for irrigation. The key implication of these findings is that greater adoption of crop insurance requires designing cost-effective insurance products considering the adaptation benefits of irrigation and other such farm practices that reduce farmers' exposure to downside risk besides causing an improvement in farm income. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Using cross-sectional data collected from 408 households in three districts of East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia, this study combined two food security indicators namely calorie intake and Food Consumption Score (FCS) so as to gain more insights on the multidimensional nature of food security and to categorise households into different food insecurity groups. The study further sought to identify factors influencing the households’ food insecurity status. The research findings based respectively on the per capita calorie intake and the FCS indicate that 36.03 and 49.02 percent of the sampled households were food insecure. However, the findings reveal that when the two indicators were combined, 22.06 and 40.93 percent of the households were completely food insecure and transitory food insecure respectively. These findings also suggest that the 40.93 percent (26.96 and 13.97 percent) of households categorised as food secure based on single indicators (i.e., per capita calorie intake and FCS respectively) was unrealistic. Furthermore, findings from the bivariate probit model indicate that food insecurity incidences decreased with the adoption of soil and water conservation, access to irrigation, livestock, access to fertilisers, and household income. It increased with the age of the household head, the household size, and the coping strategy index. Therefore, policies and strategies combating food insecurity should consider a combination of food security indicators. © 2023 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {The efficiency with which farmers use available resources is very important for agricultural production. This study examines the comparative resource use efficiency (RUE) between aerobic and conventional rice farms in Eastern Dry Zone (Zone-5) of Karnataka. Cross-sectional data were collected from 100 rice cultivating farmers (50 in Aerobic farms and 50 in Conventional farms) using snow ball sampling technique. Cobb-Douglas production function, Marginal analysis of resource utilization, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were some of the analytical tools used in the study. The mean aerobic farm size was 0.43 ha while in Conventional rice, it was 0.63 ha. The physical water use efficiency (WUE) in aerobic farms (3.84 q/ acre inch) was higher than conventional farms (1.64 q/acre inch). Also, the economic WUE was higher in aerobic farms (1643.54 `/acre inch) compared to conventional farms (269.41 `/acre inch). RUE indicated that, resources were not optimally utilized in both Aerobic Rice Cultivation (ARC) and Conventional Rice Cultivation (CRC). Bullock labour, machine labour, seeds and irrigation were underutilized in ARC, whereas, FYM was underutilized in CRC indicating that usage of additional amount of these inputs leads to increase in the returns. The DEA revealed that aerobic rice cultivating farms were more technically and economically efficient compared to conventional rice cultivating farms. Effective policies to promote and create awareness about aerobic rice can boost the rice production and productivity sustainably. The focus should be given to optimal allocation of resources which enhances the farm productivity and returns. © 2021 AESSRA. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {While climate change affects agricultural production globally, scarce literature has quantified the impacts of climatic factors on paddy yields with attention to specific water regimes, climatic zones, growth periods, and crop seasons. This study aimed to identify the effects of various climatic variables at different plant growth phases (growing and harvesting), crop seasons (Maha and Yala) [In Sri Lanka, there are two main crop seasons. Maha is the major cultivation season covering the months of October to March, and Yala is the minor cultivation season covering the months of April to September], and water regimes (major irrigation, minor irrigation, and rainfed) in three climatic zones (dry zone, intermediate zone, and wet zone) of Sri Lanka. A district-wise annual panel dataset was constructed for a 39-year period (1981 to 2019) covering 18 districts and analyzed by panel regression methods. The results showed that temperature had significant non-linear effects on yields in the dry and intermediate zones. Variation in temperature decreased yields more in the dry zone than in other zones. Rainfall significantly reduced yields in the dry and wet zones, whereas it increased yields in the intermediate zone. Rainfall fluctuations decreased yields in the wet zone more than in other zones. These findings suggest a need for dissemination of climate-smart agriculture practices by considering the characteristics of each water regime, particularly in the dry zone. For rainfed paddies, a crop insurance scheme should be introduced to reduce crop losses due to harsh climatic events. Complementary policies, such as improvement of irrigation systems and provision of timely weather forecasts, can support smallholder paddy farming. © 2022, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.},

In this context, agricultural policies were reformulated to focus on achieving a certain degree of self-sufficiency while obtaining agricultural efficiency and sustainable agricultural development. This study empirically evaluated Malaysian rice self-sufficiency (RSS) approach, focusing on production efficiency closely related to maximizing production approach and minimizing environmental impact. We utilized non‑parametric bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA), input- and output specifications to estimate the relative technical efficiency scores of decision‑making units (DMUs) by constructing confidence intervals and correcting efficiency estimations. Our finding reveals that the Malaysian RSS policy approach demonstrates a better orientation toward output maximization than resource saving. However, the average annual change of the efficiency scores in both specifications was found to deteriorate during the analyzed period. Based on regional analysis, an improved RSS strategic approach could help the nation attain rice production maximization, minimize the environmental impacts, and obtain production efficiency mainly through modernizing the irrigation systems, efficient agrochemical inputs usage, adopting best agricultural practices, and implementing soil treatments programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We infer transaction cost-reduction and trust-strengthening mechanisms as the two pathways for institutional bricolage to illustrate the process whereby a PES program enables a VMIS to internalise positive externalities. Based on data from a field survey at the household level, our empirical results confirm that a PES program is an effective means of improving the performance of VMISs in terms of environmental, economic, and equitable benefits, because it aligns benefits for the village collective with those for the overall society. We conclude that a PES program is of greater benefit to communities with local institutions and that PES programs and local institutions exert an interactive impact as they reinforce each other's effect on common pool resource management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Experience in watermelon farming influenced the adoption of suitable salt-tolerant varieties. Multinominal probit and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) results indicated that ‘farmland size owned’ is less likely to use the pond for irrigation and suitable salt tolerant varieties. Membership of a farmer association and perception of decreasing rain influenced farmers’ adoption of mulching, intercropping, use of mini ponds for irrigation, and suitable salt tolerant varieties as adaptation strategies.

	abstract = {Guar gum, the main product of the guar crop, is used widely in the USA as an emulsifier in the food industry and as fracturing fluid additive in the oil and gas industry. The USA is the number one global importer of guar, and interest has grown to domestically cultivate guar in the USA. Guar is an annual desert legume native to India and Pakistan. The goal of this study was to evaluate the environmental sustainability of growing guar in the USA via a life cycle analysis (LCA). The LCA helps identify the information gap for US agriculture and guide future field studies to optimize guar cultivation in the USA. This study concluded that in terms of environmental sustainability, irrigation, harvesting, and P-fertilization methods offer the most opportunity for improved guar agricultural sustainability. This is promising because one of guar’s prominent characteristics is its high water use efficiency and ability to grow in marginal soils. Lowering irrigation and water use can be implemented with simple management practice changes such as optimizing irrigation. In addition, this study shows that there is an opportunity for field trials to optimize fertilizer application rates to achieve the greatest yields. This study also found a knowledge gap with respect to carbon soil fluxes and field emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus from guar agriculture. As the USA considers adopting guar agriculture in the southwest, through research collaborations such as the USDA Sustainable Bioeconomy of Arid Regions Center of Excellence, it will be critical to evaluate irrigation to achieve maximum yields (e.g., drip, flood, sprinkler) and fill fertilizer and emissions knowledge gaps.

It proposes an extended Ricardian model to capture multiple adaptation decisions explicitly. The new simultaneous irrigation-crop farm decision model uses spatially detailed farm-level data of over 18,000 European farms on irrigation and seven different crop choices. The analysis shows that larger farmers and farmers in less water-scarce regions that use irrigation are more sensitive to temperature increases than rain-fed agriculture. This might be explained by the fact that these farmers do not experience the real cost of water scarcity because of which they take less efficient decisions.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Climate and environmental change are critical factors affecting water resources, irrigation and farming systems in Ethiopia as most of the population and the country’s economy depend on agriculture. The aim of this study was to investigate farmers’ perceptions of climate and environmental change and impacts of those changes on their farming systems, water resources, and irrigation. The study used a semi-structured questionnaire to interview a total of 201 rural households from nine different villages in Awash River Basin (ARB), Ethiopia. The data collected was analysed by descriptive statistics, quantitative data analysis and multinominal logistic regression using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) software. About 80, 97 and 98% of the respondents perceived the occurrence of climate variability in the Upper, Middle and Lower ARBs, respectively. Between 68 and 80% of the respondents noted that they had observed variable rainfall (either an increase or a decrease) during different seasons of the year. More than 70% of the respondents also confirmed that there was temperature change in their areas. The high awareness of climate change and environmental variability by farmers in the ARB may help decision and policymakers in establishing participatory climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Rural road infrastructure in Indonesia has increased significantly, especially during the last decade. This study presents an overview of how rural road quality and accessibility affected village economic transformation. It is the first empirical study in Indonesia addressing rural transformation. Village-level microdata, referring to the smallest administrative official, were utilized. Using a Random-Effects Panel Logit model, this study discovered that improving the type of road surface and accessibility for four-wheeled vehicles significantly increased the probability of village economic transformation. Different types of road infrastructure improvement affected the rural economic transformation both within and outside Java-Bali. Paved or concrete roads in Java-Bali had a higher marginal effect than on other islands, thereby increasing the likelihood of rural economic transformation. However, the road accessibility for four-wheeled vehicles in Java-Bali did not significantly affect the probability of rural economic transformation. Nevertheless, for villages on other islands, it did. Furthermore, the transformation significantly influenced other infrastructures, such as electricity coverage, market presence, information and communication technology (ICT), and flatland topography. Moreover, the road access to villages and the availability of water or irrigation significantly affected the probability of surviving in the agricultural sector. Following these findings, policymakers should prioritize villages’ infrastructure by considering different types of infrastructure provision across villages, referring to different infrastructure needs for Java-Bali and other islands.

Earlier work finds that higher temperatures reduce agricultural yields, which in turn reduces migration rates in low-income countries, due to liquidity constraints. We test whether access to irrigation modulates this temperature–migration relationship, since irrigation buffers agricultural incomes from high temperatures. We regress measures of international and internal migration on decadal averages of temperature and rainfall, interacted with country-level data on irrigation and income. We find robust evidence that, for poor countries, irrigation access significantly offsets the negative effect of increasing temperatures on internal migration, as proxied by urbanisation rates.

	abstract = {Spatial distribution of rice cultivated area and its future projections are indispensable for providing food security, irrigation water management, greenhouse gas emission, ecosystem, and environmental protection. Accurate simulation of future rice cultivation is challenging in the context of climate change involving spatial modeling. This study introduced a hydrological data-based prediction approach integrating cellular automata-Markov chain model with multi-criteria decision analysis. Three decadal transitions of different land use land cover (LULC) in an agricultural intensified canal irrigated area were analyzed using Random Forest algorithm. The Landsat satellite imageries were classified with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. The results revealed that the area under water sources, plantation, and fallow land decreased by 53.1%, 33.9%, and 63.6%, respectively, while habitation and Boro rice cultivated area increased significantly by 1243.3% and 211%, respectively, during 1988–2018. The kappa coefficient (0.86), allocation disagreement (10.9%), and quantity disagreement (1.16%) revealed good agreement between the predicted and classified LULC map of 2018. The probable distribution of the LULC map in 2028 and 2038 indicated 54.5% and 59.3% of the command area under Boro rice cultivation as a dominant land cover, respectively. Further, the predicted LULC map anticipated that Boro rice cultivation was likely to expand at the expense of plantation and fallow land which may lead to massive water scarcity in the near future. The proposed approach covered up the limitations of spatial modeling on agricultural growth trends by integrating significant driving factors with quantitative and spatiotemporal aspects of LULC transition. These findings will provide a baseline map for sustainable policy reformation and contemplation on the repercussions that local LULC transition has on global environmental change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

We examine the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria and explore interactions between climatic, agronomic, hydrological, and socio-economic conditions and processes to provide policy advice. The assessment is conducted with a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework to analyze impacts on land and irrigation water use, land management, and net benefits of agricultural production. The model results show that with imposed groundwater restrictions for irrigation, land use shifts from irrigated vineyards to mostly rainfed cropland with declining regional net benefits of agricultural production. The direction of change is similar for a DRY, SIMILAR, and WET climate scenario, while the magnitude differs. We estimate that an increase of the marginal value of groundwater extraction for irrigation by 0.1 €/m3 results in an average decrease in groundwater extraction volumes by 17.2 Mm3 in DRY, 6.3 Mm3 in SIMILAR, and 6.4 Mm3 in WET. Furthermore, regional net benefits of agricultural production decrease by 3.4 M€ in DRY and SIMILAR, and by 1.6 M€ in WET, on average.

Considering different ex-ternalities that can affect producers’ irrigation decisions, we investigate whether per-manently retiring groundwater rights impacts groundwater use among active neighboring groundwater users. We find that enrollment in the retirement program causes neighboring wells to initially pump less groundwater on average. However, water use reductions are only temporary, due to relative increases in stock levels over time. The results imply that policies that retire water rights may conserve more water than an-ticipated in the short term, but, over time, higher resource stocks could lead to policy leakage. We also present evidence that the decrease in groundwater use is driven by the shared resource stock.

	abstract = {This paper used original survey data in Shandong province of China to depict local farmers’ perceptions of combined climatic and market risks, and their adaptive behaviors. Two Logit models were developed to capture the empirical relationship between farmers’ risk perception of the combined risks and adaptive behaviors. Results show that farmer’s risk perception of climate change and market significantly affected their adoption behavior of adaptive measures, including perception of rainfall decrease, gale decrease, drought increase, and price fall of agricultural products. Moreover farmers’ adaptive behaviors are more sensitive to their perceptions of extreme climatic events. Addition of demographic factors can improve the explanatory capacity of the Logit model. As illustrated by the models, male and better educated farmers have greater willingness to take actions for averting risks, while household heads with bigger farm are more reluctant. A majority of respondents chose to construct farm structure for irrigation and water conservation to avert climatic risks. Insurance, which is regarded as an effective tool to help farmers mitigate risks and avoid losses, has not been sufficiently accepted by farmers in rural areas in Shandong province. This underscores the need of effective communication of knowledge to enhance farmers’ coping capacity and to encourage their active response to risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa faces a multitude of challenges arising from land degradation, climate change, and limited access to improved technology. In this context, technologies that raise farmers’ crop productivity while mitigating risk exposure are particularly valuable. This study assesses the impacts of a modified, rainfed variant of the system of rice intensification (SRI) on expected yields, yield variance (variability) and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk) in Tanzania. The appeal of the technology lies in its yield-enhancing potential, its low demand for complementary external inputs as well as its drought resistance features. While the uptake of SRI has been considerable in Asia, the limited uptake in Africa is puzzling, particularly given its suitability for the African setting. Our empirical strategy relies on the estimation of marginal treatment effect (MTE) models. We find that, while the average effects on adopters suggest that SRI enhances yield and reduces the downside risk of crop failure, the marginal treatment effects indicate that only farmers with low resistance to adoption, benefit. Our analysis also highlights the importance of farmers’ climate perception for the adoption of SRI and the need for policies that increase climate awareness to ensure food security. However, these results may well be specific to small scale, rainfed rice cultivation in Africa and therefore may not be generalizable to situations where SRI relies on irrigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The current study modifies the sustainable framework of livelihoods to clarify the role of irrigation management in farmers’ land-use choices. A five-wave panel dataset of 1,534 farms for the period 2008–2016 in Viet Nam (with a total of 7,669 observations) is used for analyzing the influence of irrigation management on land-use selections, employing a fixed-effects model. Irrigation management is investigated in six aspects: (i) the physical conditions, (ii) the ownership of facilities, (iii) the operations, (iv) the management responsibility shift, (v) the decision-making, and (vi) the maintenance. The results reveal that the overall effects of irrigation management are so different, depending on the types of land uses. On top of that, different aspects of irrigation management have diversified influences on types of land uses. The findings lead to several important implications related to irrigation management that are relevant to farmers and policymakers. Different stakeholders, organizations/institutions, and farming households play differently effective roles in irrigation management. In general, policies can be conducted through the development of a lined irrigation network, and decision-making in operations of irrigation, maintenance of irrigation, and irrigation maintenance should give more power to farmers’ groups. © 2022 The Author(s).

A clearer understanding of the trajectories of cropping intensification can promote policy responses to current impacts, adaptations, and target support to farmers. This research aimed to assess (i) observed and perceived changes in temperature, rainfall and salinization, (ii) impacts of these changes on local cropping and aquaculture systems, and (iii) cropping system intensification. Primary data were collected in discussions with farmers (n = 63), extension service providers (n = 7) and researchers (n = 5) in the study area. Secondary data on climate, soil salinity, and farming systems were obtained from government sources. Respondents perceived increasing temperature, decreasing rainfall with anomalous patterns, increasing soil salinization, and increasing extreme events consistent with the observed meteorological data. The impacts were changes in farming operations, increased natural enemies, reduced irrigation water supplies, and yield losses. Cropping intensity in the study region increased from 135% in 1992–175% in 2018, though it is still below the national figure (194%). The intensification is driven by biophysical and socio-economics factors and supported by research, extension and infrastructure development.

	abstract = {The issue of water resource management in the Sistan region has been complicated by water fluctuations of the Hirmand River in recent years. The decrease in the water flowing toward Sistan and followed by continuous droughts has caused a severe water crisis in this region. The critical situation of water resources in the Sistan region has faced a serious problem in the process of sustainable development in this region. Consequently, it has become more imperative to adopt effective approaches for optimal and efficient management of water, especially in the agricultural sector as it is the biggest water consumer in the Sistan region. This research focused on the optimal allocation of water to the agricultural sector with an emphasis on the water market by integrating the Stackelberg–Nash–Cournot equilibrium model and Nerlove’s supply model. The Stackelberg–Nash–Cournot equilibrium game was run with a metaheuristic algorithm composed of a dynamic genetic algorithm and a fuzzy programming method. Also, to cope with the challenges, tackle the future uncertainty, and provide more information for the adjustment of the agricultural irrigation pattern, the scenario-building technique was applied in which two parameters of irrigation coefficient and the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector were changed. The results showed that the Hirmand 2 region has been allocated with the highest amount of water. The lowest amount of water is allocated to wheat and barley due to their low return, whereas the highest amount of water is allocated to onion and melon production. By creating a water market, the economic profit increases by 20,013 million IRR, and the inequity in water allocation changes by 0.02. The results of modeling the scenario of different irrigation coefficients and water allocated show that the economic profit increases to 695,152 and 6,109,136 million IRR when the irrigation coefficient increases to 50% and 70%, it increases to 474,550 million IRR when the amount of water allocated is increased, and it decreases to 834,946 million IRR when the amount of water allocated is decreased. The comparison of the allocation with and without a water market shows the significance and effectiveness of the water market. Accordingly, the establishment of a regional water market in the Sistan region not only changes the water allocated to the crops in the studied regions and the profit of the cropping pattern but also improves the income of the farmers and contributes to equity in water allocation among the regions. Also, the water market contributes to reducing the amount of water allocated per unit of economic profit. Given the supportive and constructive role of local and regional water markets, it is recommended to lay the ground for establishing this mechanism and optimally using it. In order to overcome the lack of water among crops and gain more economic profit, it is possible to implement the scenario of increasing irrigation efficiency using modern irrigation systems. According to the results of water allocation between regions and agricultural crops, it is suggested that low-yield crops such as wheat and barley have been removed from the cultivation pattern and replaced by high-yield crops such as onions, melons and alfalfa. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In this study, we show how this inequality is intersectional; identities like gender and age compound and interact with systems of power to shape how people adapt to these changes at the individual, household, and district scales. We draw from 130 semi-structured interviews with agricultural actors and participant observations in district and regional meetings across four districts, to demonstrate how intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change. Our results show (1) what social-ecological changes are perceived and experienced, (2) how individuals, households, and groups within the agricultural sector adapt to these changes in private (at the individual and household scale) and public adaptation spaces (institutions where people adapt collectively within each district), and (3) how intersectionality shapes adaptive capacity to these changes. Specifically, we found that ‘unskilled’ women diversified their income through day-labor in agriculture, while ‘unskilled’ men had more options for income diversification. Migrants who are also renters had access to water; however, migrants who lived in informal settlements lacked water access. Pastoralists over 50 faced more difficulties pursuing income diversification and labor migration than younger populations with similar livelihoods. Public adaptation spaces, including irrigation commissions, were largely designed for Spanish-speaking men who own land, which caused additional barriers for Quechua speakers, women, and migrants who used this space to contribute to adaptation for themselves, their household, and for the broader district. Together, these results expand scholarship on differential adaptation to social-ecological change within globally marginalized, yet locally heterogenous, communities. In particular, this study brings to light how intersecting identities, along with the social, political and economic structures in which they are situated, can lead to unequal adaptation opportunities within heterogeneous communities. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Agriculture affects climate change and contributes directly and indirectly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, no reports have fully quantified the GHG emissions from different crop systems in China. In this study, the carbon emission and carbon sequestration inventories and the carbon footprint (CF) of 16 major crop systems in China from 2001 to 2018 were analyzed with a cradle-to-farm gate life cycle analysis approach for the first time. The results showed that the largest farm CF and product CF were vegetables (11.9 t CO2 eq ha−1) and tea (4.6 t CO2 eq t−1), respectively. From the perspective of crop emissions and processes, the main crop systems influencing the national total net carbon emissions (NTCE) from crop production are rice, maize, wheat, fruits and vegetables, accounting for 87.3–90.4%; the key emission processes for NTCE are fertilization and irrigation, accounting for 73.7–76.8%. The NTCE has increased by 410.4 Mt CO2 eq from 2001 to 2018, of which maize, fruits and vegetables were the main crops that explained 99.0%, while fertilization and irrigation were the key factors and explained 91.9% of these increases. Scenario analysis indicated that increasing the straw return rate and partially replacing chemical fertilizers with manure have a minimal impact on NTCE. In contrast, reducing the loss of reactive nitrogen is the most effective single strategy to alleviate agricultural GHG emissions in the future. Our results will provide a fresh perspective for the development of more effective GHG emission reduction strategies for agricultural green development. © 2021},

This study aimed to develop a multicriteria analysis (MCA) framework to identify and rank suitable sites for different indigenous RWH systems in data-poor areas taking Sana’a Basin, Yemen, as a case study. Unlike previous research, this study focused only on indigenous RWH systems and, for the first time, considered the site suitability analysis of spate irrigation systems. Five biophysical and six socioeconomic criteria were used to select, prioritize, and map suitable zones for indigenous RWH systems. This study, the first to be conducted in Yemen, found that more than 30% of the case area has a high or very high level of suitability for each of the studied RWH systems. Only 11% to 17% of the area is not suitable for RWH due to socioeconomic activities. Twenty-four percent of the area was considered moderately suitable, and 28% had a low level of suitability for RWH. These results are promising, and the preliminary identification process of suitable areas for indigenous RWH systems is a useful guide for future water resource and land management programs.

	abstract = {The most important element in the development of the irrigation regime of agricultural crops is the total water consumption or/and the amount of water that plants need during the growing season to obtain the planned crop in specific natural conditions while optimising all technological processes. The purpose of the study is to determine the features of total water consumption and average daily evaporation of winter wheat plants depending on the natural moisture supply of growing years, irrigation regimes, and groundwater level in the irrigation zone of southern Ukraine. In the course of the study, generally accepted methods were used: System approach and systems analysis, monographic, analysis and synthesis, abstract-logical, historical, field research, statistical and economic-mathematical, etc. The highest indicators of total water consumption were observed in the average weather conditions and amounted to 4,263 m3/ha in the 2-metre layer of soil, in wet years characterised by moderate temperatures, high humidity, and a considerable number of days with precipitation, the average water consumption from this soil layer was 3,993 m3/ha. In dry years, which were characterised by hot weather with low humidity and low precipitation, the total water consumption was the lowest and amounted to 3685 m3/ha. The reduction of the growing season occurs in late June-early July when high air temperatures and low humidity are observed, which is the main reason for the decrease in the total water consumption of irrigated winter wheat. Analysis of data on the use of moisture from different soil layers indicates that during the autumn growing season and during the wintering of plants water reserves in the deep layers are replenished. In general, during the growing season of winter wheat, considering the winter period, the field of this crop consumes an average of 5.2 thousand m³ of water during irrigation over 12 years. Observation of the average daily evaporation of winter wheat plants in conditions of natural and artificial irrigation indicates that it has the form of a parabola, the maximum mark of which falls on the interphase period of earing-the beginning of milky ripeness of grain.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Tobacco is considered as one of the most important industrial cash crop and source of livelihood to many families in Pakistan. Considering the contraction of land under tobacco cultivation, the present study is intended to evaluate the production efficiency of tobacco growers in southern Punjab, Pakistan. The Data Envelopment Analysis model was used to investigate energy usage efficiency of tobacco farmers based on seven energy inputs; human labour, farm machinery, irrigation, diesel, fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and a single output. Moreover, the current study also used DEA – super efficiency to identify and rank efficient and inefficient tobacco producers; and to suggest optimum energy requirements and energy savings potentials. The primary data from 210 tobacco growers were collected in-person interviews by random sampling technique. The findings of the study revealed that average energy consumed in the form of inputs and yield obtained in tobacco production was 52,703.58 MJ/ha-1 and 3,096.98 MJ/ha-1, respectively. Average technical, pure technical, and scale efficiency score was calculated to be 0.902, 0.961, and 0.938, respectively. Likewise, the energy-saving ratio in tobacco production was estimated to be 13.83%, which implies that by adopting the proposed recommendations about 7,121.66 MJ/ha-1 energy could be saved without compromising the output. Also, fertilizers, chemicals, irrigation, and diesel had the highest share in the consumption of energy inputs. The findings of the study provides pinpoint options to the agricultural polices makers to launch the technical training programs for the tobacco farmers to adopt better management practices to optimize the application of energy inputs to reduce the cost of tobacco production. The agricultural extension department should also visit the tobacco fields to assist the farmers about timely application of inputs and with extension services. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

Although there is an increasing literature on the institutional preconditions required for successful formal water markets, there has been less focus on understanding what drives participation after establishment of the basic enabling conditions. Participation can be measured in terms of either trading activity (conducting either a permanent or temporary water trade) and/or trade volumes across time and market products. Australia's water markets in the Southern and Northern Basins of the Murray-Darling Basin provide a notable example of a 'tale of two water markets', offering insights about the economic policy levers that can drive participation across different hydrological, irrigation, and socioeconomic contexts. Key lessons include: distribution of initial property rights in resource allocation; the need to prepare for and seize opportunities to strengthen property rights; and robust monitoring and compliance requirements - all of which will reduce transaction costs and increase participation. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {After two decades of implementation, Indonesia's program to reform its irrigation sector can be assessed yielding lessons on water policy reform. This reform coincided with state-wide decentralization, and shifted decision-making from a central ministry to a distributed arrangement in which local governments and Water User Associations assume part of irrigation authority and budget. The policy was formulated with different stakeholders in 1999–2004 based on field pilots and was implemented using an adaptive, sequential approach while developing institutional capacity of local governments and farmers. Relatively coherent longitudinal monitoring data sets are available on field-level practices, economic returns on projects (with and without, and before and after reform), and rice production. Institutional development was monitored by performance indicators. The overall reform effectiveness is assessed by analyzing the appropriateness of the new arrangement, and the processes of the policy design and of its implementation. After two decades well over three quarters of the country is applying the policy albeit with varying quality. At field level water supply and allocation turned more reliable, and conflicts better managed. Rice production increased year over year after 2005 correlating with policy roll-out. Irrigation Departments proved less adequate in partnering with farmers, however. Institutional capacity generated one quarter to two thirds of the economic benefit from investments that combined scheme rehabilitation and institutional capacity development. As institutional capacity develops slowly full roll-out may require up to three decades. The analysis shows that in the context of ‘wicked’ policy implementation, not only normative policy design matters, but equally importantly, the sequencing of the process of implementation allowing adaptation to physical, institutional and political realities; still, to be successful a process must build on a credible realistic ‘model’. This is especially true in developing and emerging economies with weaker institutional capacities and more fragmented governance structures. © 2020 The Author},

We conducted framed field experiments to compare the effects of these messengers on consumers’ monetary bids on different items produced with recycled and conventional irrigation water. Using recycled wastewater for agricultural irrigation has the potential to conserve substantial amounts of fresh water. Although using recycled water for irrigating of both edible and inedible crops can be safe for human consumption, people may stigmatize these products since the origin of the waste water is still too apparent. Providing consumers with information about recycled water can help ameliorate their negative perceptions, and the effectiveness of such information can depend on the origin, i.e. the messenger. Our results suggest that participants respond least favourably when the message is attributed to a scientist and most favourably when the message is attributed to a newspaper. Further analysis shows that consumer responses to the scientist messenger fall into two general categories: (1) individuals who place zero bids and (2) individuals who place relatively larger bids in response to information from scientists. © 2019},

However, use of sustainable intensification practices (SIPs) is low in many sub-Sharan African countries. This study examined the adoption of SIPs in Kenyan rural and peri-urban vegetable production to understand the scale of and underlying factors in the use of SIPs. A multistage sampling technique was employed to randomly select 685 rural and peri-urban vegetable farm households. Household data was then collected and anaylsed for four practices namely improved irrigation, integrated soil fertility, organic manure and crop diversification using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. A multivariate probit model was run to model simultaneous interdependent adoption decisions. Adoption of organic manure and African indigenous vegetables (AIV) diversification was high in both rural and peri-urban areas. However, adoption of improved irrigation systems and integrated soil fertility management was low, and even significantly lower in rural areas than in peri-urban areas (p < 0.041). Similarly, adoption intensity of SIPs was lower in rural areas than in peri-urban areas. Furthermore, the findings also show complementarities and substitutabilities between SIPs. Market integration, the farm location and household income were the major factors heavily influencing the adoption of most SIPs. Policies and programmes that seek to build household financial capital base and integrate farm households into effective and efficient vegetable markets need to be formulated and implemented in order to enhance adoption of SIPs in AIV production. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Key Points: We examine the response of barley, canola, and spring wheat yields to a set of climate variables on both dryland and irrigated lands in southern Alberta, Canada. We find that warming and increased precipitation tend to increase crop yields on dryland, increased precipitation in June and July tends to show opposite effects on crop yields on irrigated lands. Based on regional climate change projection scenarios, we find that climate change decreases crop yields for all the three crops under dryland production. However, yields of canola and spring wheat under irrigation are slightly increased. Few researchers have examined the impact of climate change on irrigated agriculture and crop production. This may be due to an assumption by researchers that irrigation management can offset impacts of climate change. We investigate this issue by examining the response of barley, canola, and spring wheat yields to a set of climate variables on both dryland and irrigated lands in southern Alberta, Canada, with a panel data set at the county level from 1983 to 2007. Our results suggest that warming and increased precipitation tend to increase dryland crop yields, while increased precipitation in June and July tends to show opposite effects on crop yields on irrigated lands. Based on regional projected climate change scenarios, we find that climate change decreases crop yields for all the three crops under dryland production. However, yields of canola and spring wheat under irrigation are increased slightly. Peu de chercheurs se sont penchés sur les impacts des changements climatiques sur l'agriculture irriguée et le rendement des cultures. Il se pourrait que ce soit parce que les chercheurs supposent que les régimes d'irrigation peuvent neutralise les impacts des changements climatiques. Nous examinons cet enjeu en étudiant le rendement de l'orge, du canola et du blé de printemps en fonction de variables climatiques à la fois en sols arides et en sols irrigués au sud de l'Alberta, au Canada avec un ensemble de données de panel provenant des comtés de 1983 à 2007. Les résultats démontrent que le réchauffement et l'augmentation des précipitations semblent accroître le rendement des sols arides mais que cette dernière, lorsqu'elle survient en juin ou juillet, semble engendrer l'effet contraire sur le rendement en sols irrigués. Nous constatons, selon les scénarios hypothétiques de changements climatiques régionaux, une diminution du rendement agricole pour les trois cultures en sols arides. Par contre, le rendement des cultures de canola et de blé de printemps en sols irrigués augmenterait légèrement. © 2017 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society},

Drip irrigation is a modern, advanced, high-tech and environmental technology, which providing right scientific support, enables to get high yields and economic benefits with minimum consequences for the environment. The proposed methodological approaches to calculating the cost-effectiveness of investments were tested at various sites of the irrigation zone of Ukraine. The results of the calculations showed that the cultivation of high-productivity hybrids of vegetables and fruit when using modern technology of drip irrigation provides high yields and standard quality of production, that is the crop production is transformed into a stable profitable business. At the same time, applying modern methods of evaluation of the feasibility of investment will increase the validity of management decisions as to the selection of crops and their combinations and will facilitate investment attraction.

	abstract = {Who participates in modern agricultural value chains (henceforth high-value markets [HVMs]) and what determinants inform HVM participation remains a question of interest to researchers and policymakers. This issue is noteworthy because of the positive welfare effects of HVM participation. In this article, we review the empirical literature on determinants influencing HVM participation. We use quantitative descriptive statistics and meta-regression analysis to investigate a related unexplored question. What and to what extent do contextual factors (or moderators) affect the relevance of these determinants? We find that certain determinants are more relevant in specific regions. For example, access to credit, extension services, additional sources of income, and gender have greater relevance in Africa compared to Asia and South America, whereas membership in collective groups and access to irrigation facilities are important in Asia. We show that several moderators, most notably temporal factor, the econometric estimator employed by the primary study, the market coordination instrument and type of HVM channel either enhance or diminish the relevance of the determinants. Our findings show clearly that different regions require different policy interventions to encourage smallholder HVM participation. We discuss and frame this issue around which public and private sector value chain stakeholders are best positioned to minimise the costs and maximise the benefits and sustainability of such interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Impacts of agricultural practices on water quality and quantity are many and varied. This paper proposes a typology approach of irrigation water management problems in Nestos river basin, North Greece. A novel quantitative SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is recommended for identifying the internal and external factors that influence the irrigation sector. Specifically, a double-round Delphi-type interactive survey method has been employed to rank and quantify environmental impacts of water use in agriculture sector, according to the literature, as well as a previous qualitative research conducted in the region. An independent group comprised of 20 experts engaged in irrigation water issues (academics, policy directors, business executives, and selected farmers) was invited to asses and rank all factors, identified by the SWOT. After experts’ ranking, they were invited, in a second round, to propose potential policy implications for the major weaknesses and threats which emerged from the SWOT analysis. The results from this approach could be a tool for assisting the formulation of strategy in water management sector. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The paper assessed the existing adaptation strategies implemented by farmers in the Upper East Region of Ghana to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and variability. The paper used data collected through a series of participatory methods including focus group discussions, questionnaire surveys and key informant interviews in 4 farming communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the Bongo and Talensi-Nabdam Districts of the Upper East Region. Results showed that farmers’ adaptation to climate change and variability may be categorized under agricultural, water management, communal pooling and livelihood diversification techniques. Specific livelihood diversification adaptation practices identified in the study communities include charcoal or fuel wood sales, temporal and permanent migration to urban areas in search of non-existing jobs. Communal pooling, involving joint ownership and sharing of wealth, labor or incomes across households, is not widely practiced and should be enhanced. The findings showed that male and female farmers may engage in different set of adaptation practices to cope with climate change. Further, the results showed that farmers, especially female farmers, were constrained by a lack of property rights of farmlands, lack of credit facilities and lack of access to irrigation facilities, inadequate climate change information and inadequate seeds for planting. The paper recommends that farmers should be encouraged to form farmer-based associations to network socially, access credit facilities, land, insurance products, extension services and training to empower communities and women. Fostering peer exchange of information between communities will ensure best practices, and lessons learnt are shared and scaled-up.

	abstract = {Adoption of technology is indispensable for increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to credit is often identified as a constraint on the adoption of agricultural technology. Recently, microcredit has generated considerable enthusiasm and hope for ensuring sustainable financial inclusion of the poor. We conducted randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the impact of microcredit on the adoption of technology and productivity of rice cultivation in Tanzania. Collaboratively with BRAC, a globally-known microfinance institution, we offered microcredit specifically designed for agriculture to randomly selected farmers. We estimate the intention-to-treat effect (ITT) as well as the local average treatment effect (LATE) of microcredit, by using the treatment status as an instrumental variable (IV). Overall, we find no evidence that the BRAC program increases the use of chemical fertilizer. Also, credit use does not result in an increase in paddy yield, profit from rice cultivation, or household income. Our results from sub-sample analyses suggest that credit does not increase the fertilizer use by those who have better access to irrigation water as they have already applied the amount of fertilizer near to the recommended level. On the other hand, credit increases the fertilizer use by those who have limited access to irrigation water and have previously used little fertilizer. However, possibly due to the poor yield response to fertilizer, the increase in chemical fertilizer use does not result in higher yield for them. We also observed similar phenomenon for the comparison between trained and non-trained borrowers before the intervention. Our study suggests that improving credit access may not be enough to increase small-scale farmers’ technology adoption, agricultural productivity, and welfare. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sustainable groundwater quality is a key global concern and has become a major issue of disquiets in most parts of the world including Bangladesh. Hence, the assessment of groundwater quality is an important study to ensure its sustainability for various uses. In this study, a combination of multivariate statistics, geographical information system (GIS) and geochemical approaches was employed to evaluate the groundwater quality and its sustainability in Joypurhat district of Bangladesh. The results showed that the groundwater samples are mainly Ca–Mg–HCO3 type. Principal component analysis (PCA) results revealed that geogenic sources (rock weathering and cation exchange) followed by anthropogenic activities (domestic sewage and agro-chemicals) were the major factors governing the groundwater quality of the study area. Furthermore, the results of PCA are validated using the cluster analysis and correlation matrix analysis. Based on the groundwater quality index (GWQI), it is found that all the groundwater samples belong to excellent to good water quality domains for human consumption, although iron, fluoride and iodide contaminated to the groundwater, which do not pose any significant health hazard according to World Health Organization’s and Bangladesh’s guideline values. The results of irrigation water quality index including sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), permeability index and sodium percentage (Na %) suggested that most of the groundwater samples are good quality water for agricultural uses. The spatial distribution of the measured values of GWQI, SAR, Fe (iron), EC (electrical conductivity) and TH (total hardness) were spatially mapped using the GIS tool in the study area. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Also, farmers' literacy rate may raise the efficiency level of their farms. Besides this, if a farmer wants to increase the efficiency level then the cost of transportation and the rent paid must have to be decreased. There is also a scope of improvement in the efficiency level for all categories of farmers by the improvement in the irrigation facility. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions —where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction. To tackle this problem, policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies. However, these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction. Estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time-consuming because they vary depending on technology- and location-specific conditions, and their interactions. Thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates, even if rough. This paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies. Our case study is the aquifer of Valle de Aguascalientes, Mexico —where extraction is more than 80% above of the natural recharge. We have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft. These results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in Aguascalientes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Zambian economy is predominantly based on exploitation of its natural resources. The water resources in particular are important for the socioeconomic development of the country. Managing water resources sustainably requires a good understanding of the current and future availability of these resources at local level: how much water is available, where is it available and when? This study assesses the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and the impacts of projected climate change on water resource availability in Zambia. The study employs statistical downscaling of future climate scenarios and a water balance model in a hydrological modeling framework to assess the impacts of climate change on water availability. Unlike past studies done at national, regional or global levels, analysis in this study was done at the local river basin level. The main results indicate that temperature is projected to increase by 1.9 °C and 2.3 °C by 2050 and 2100, respectively, in Zambia. Rainfall is projected to decrease by about 3% by mid-century and only marginally by about 0.6% toward the end of the century across the country. These changes in rainfall and temperature will decrease water availability by 13% by the end of the century in 2100 at national level. At the river basin level, the northern basins are projected to stay the same or experience slight gains in water resources compared to those in the southern and western parts of Zambia where reductions up to 9% are projected. In particular, Zambezi, Kafue and Luangwa River basins are projected to have less water resources available due to reduced rainfall and higher temperatures. Two main implications for irrigation development follow in Zambia. More water-efficient irrigation technologies are needed and water resources will need to be better managed and regulated to cope with the projected water stresses due to climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {On-farm surface water storage systems can supplement irrigation needs and relieve pressure on surface streams. Using choice experiments, this study assessed farmer’ preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for the different attributes of on-farm water storage systems: all year water availability for irrigation, reduction of water resource conflicts and improved water quality. Results show that if smallholder irrigators could be assured of all year water availability, they would be willing to pay US$ 1459.90 per household per hectare. Similarly, a reduction in water resource conflicts attracted a marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) of US$ 1470.20 per household, while improved water quality for domestic use and ecosystems had a MWTP of US$ 870.20. High preferences and WTP for these attributes suggest that policies geared towards addressing water resource conflicts and uncertainty of irrigation water supply need to incorporate on-farm surface water storage systems. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Using data collected in 2013 from 630 farm households in the coastal delta of South-West Bangladesh, this study assesses the factors associated with the adoption of small-scale machine types, particularly irrigation pumps, threshers and power tillers (two-wheel tractors). We use a multivariate probit model to account for the interdependence of machine type use and show the likelihood of adoption to be enhanced by the farmers’ economic position, market access and participation in off-farm work. Critically, machinery ownership is not necessary for their use as most farmers hire these machine services. Key policy implications are to facilitate machinery access and use by enabling the development of small-scale machinery and custom hiring services, and enhancing farmers’ income through access to markets, knowledge and off-farm income generating opportunities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this work is to make an IoT-based low-cost and power-efficient portable system to control irrigation using a threshold value algorithm and to measure soil-irrigation-related parameters such as soil moisture, soil temperature, humidity and air temperature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a threshold value algorithm to optimize power consumption and to control irrigation process. Findings: The system uses ESP-12F 8266 as the main microcontroller unit to monitor and control irrigation system. The system also consists of an actuator system that triggers automatically based on a threshold value algorithm. An open-source cloud platform is used to monitor and store all the data for future perspective. To make the system run for a long time without any human intervention, a solar panel is used as an alternate source of energy for charging the 12V lithium-ion battery. The battery takes 2.64 h for full charging considering peak intensity of sunlight. A capacitive moisture sensor is included using less expensive 555 timer and calibrated to measure water content in the soil. The 555 timer is used in astable mode of configuration to generate a signal of 572 KHz. The calibrated sensor data when compared with a standard SEN0193 moisture sensor shows an error of 3.4%. The prototype model is made to optimize the power consumption. This can be achieved by utilizing sleep mode of ESP-12F 8266. The total cost involved to make the system is 3900.55 Indian rupees and around US$54.90. Practical implications: The device is tested in a flower garden during winter season of Nagaland, India, for 75 days to collect all the data and to automate the irrigation process. Originality/value: The proposed threshold value algorithm optimizes the power consumption of the device, and wastage of water is reduced up to 60% as compared to the traditional method of irrigation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Integration of advanced irrigation systems and technology is essential to improve crop water productivity and yields, especially in developing countries. This study aims at investigating the effects of adopting a drip irrigation system combined with hand-dug wells on crop water productivity and yields of household farmers and their perception on the proposed scheme over two cropping seasons in the Haramaya District, Ethiopia. We chose three locally called “Kebeles” within the District, and selected a certain number of household farmers that had similar characteristics within each Kebele. The selected farmers had practiced both the proposed drip irrigation with private hand-dug wells water supply (intervention pilots) and traditionally-used surface irrigation with communal water supply (non-intervention pilots) schemes. We also conducted interviews with the selected household farmers, personal observations, and measurements on crop water productivity and yields for both intervention and non-intervention pilots. We found that the proposed drip irrigation system significantly improved the crop productivity and yields of the farmers. More importantly, findings indicated that the use of drip irrigation system combined with hand-dug well water supplies reduced the over-exploitation of water (water savings) and labor-intensive manual-irrigation. The latter particularly helped women to work less on their farm works and thus provided them a flexible system to expand their plot sizes and grow a variety of crops. Overall, the drip irrigation system with water supply from hand-dug wells is highly recommended as it allows a flexible system for household farmers and provides an opportunity to expand their plot sizes with a variety of crops, which is also expected to mitigate the negative implications of climate change on freshwater water resources and crop productivity. However, the farmers of the Haramaya District expressed their need on capacity building, financial and technical supports from local to regional governments and other agencies to ensure an efficient and cost-effective drip irrigation system and to further improve their crop water productivity and yield, food self-sufficieny, and livelihoods. It is also important to consider market-based farming approaches, while promoting efficient irrigation systems and self-supply to ensure quick investment returns. This study recommends to adopt and expand the proposed drip irrigation system at household levels in Sub-Saharan and other similar regions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The debate around what kind of irrigation, large- or small-scale, modern or traditional, best contributes to food security and rural development continues to shape irrigation policies and development in the Global South. In Tanzania, the irrigation categories of ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’ are dominating irrigation policies and are shaping interventions. In this paper, we explore what these concepts really entail in the Tanzanian context and how they relate to a case of farmer-led groundwater irrigation development in Kahe ward, Kilimanjaro Region. For our analysis, we rely on three months of qualitative fieldwork in 2016, a household questionnaire, secondary data such as policy documents and the results of a mapping exercise in 2014–2015. In the early 2000s, smallholders in Kahe started developing groundwater. This has led to a new, differentiated landscape in which different forms of agricultural production co-exist. The same set of groundwater irrigation technologies has facilitated the emergence of different classes of farmers, ranging from those engaging with subsistence farming to those doing capitalist farming. The level of inputs and integration with markets vary, as does crop choice. As such, some farms emulate the ‘modern’ ideal of commercial farming promoted by the government, while others do not, or to a lesser extent. We also find that national policy discourses on irrigation are not necessarily repeated at the local level, where interventions are strongly driven by prioritization based on conflict and funding. We conclude that the policy concepts of traditional and modern irrigation do not do justice to the complexity of actual irrigation development in the Kahe case, and obfuscate its contribution to rural development and food security. We argue that a single irrigation technology does not lead to a single agricultural mode of production, and that irrigation policies and interventions should take into account the differentiation among irrigators. © 2018 The Authors},

To address this, present study is an attempt to quantify the impacts of climate change on net income from crop farming in Bangladesh using Ricardian method. For estimating the relationship between net crop income and climatic parameters, farm household and climate data were collected from the selected agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Bangladesh. The results revealed that net crop income is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal temperature. Temperature rise was found to be positively influencing net crop income in AEZs having adequate irrigation facilities. Marginal impact estimates suggest that increase in temperature and rainfall will lead to increase in net income from crop farming in Bangladesh. However, the impacts will vary significantly across cropping seasons and space (studied AEZs). Using selected AOGCM scenarios, the study predicts that net crop incomes are expected to increase in the future. The empirical findings underscore the need for policy makers to take agro-ecological zones specific effects of climate change into consideration when formulating and implementing the adaptation strategies in Bangladesh. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a complex system which takes into consideration the area-specific biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. However, the existing development and implementation of agriculture-based technology and programs are not area specific. One of the key challenges in this regard is the lack of a proper methodology to identify the area specificity. Resource management domain (RMD) method that incorporates both biophysical and socioeconomic condition has emerged out as a better way to identify area-specific best practices. The RMD method results in the delineation of area RMDs having similar management requirements for the similar land use. In the present study, the RMD method has been used to identify RMD-specific best practices. Focused group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in the delineated RMDs in order to investigate the farmer’s specific needs. The findings of the FGDs were compared with the existing government programs and shared with the local administrative authorities. The local administrative authorities have proposed few programs to bridge the identified gaps between the existing programs and the RMD-specific farming needs; however, it was realized that the proposed programs, though important, are not sufficient enough to completely address the identified RMD-specific challenges. Therefore, they were complemented with the best practices which emerged out from the FGDs, the literature review conducted in the similar settings, based on the interviews with the experts who are well aware of the district. The identified best practices include in situ and ex situ rainwater conservation, use of micro-irrigation system, minimal use of saline groundwater, adoption of a diversified farming system, shift to less water-intensive and saline-tolerant crop varieties, efficient use of fertilizers, crop residue retention, solar irrigation tube wells, community management of forest and water harvesting structures. A road map is also recommended for the implementation of these practices by the district authorities. The findings of the study thus provide an important pathway for the development, management and monitoring of agricultural and natural resource conservation programs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

It demonstrates the importance of aspirations to informing agricultural policies and understanding the behaviour of farmers and their vision regarding their farms. The Heckman two-step regression model was used to determine factors affecting aspirations/willingness of farmers to expand in the first stage and their ability to achieve or realise those aspirations in the second stage. The paper identifies five key factors that influence farmer aspirations (willingness to expand), i.e., positive psychological capital, access to markets, access to credit, land tenure security, and membership in other social groups. Gender, asset ownership, access to markets and local resource use conflicts were significant in determining farmers’ ability to achieve those aspirations. The study reveals the importance of developing positive psychological capital among smallholders and affirms the need for affordable production credit. To better make use of irrigation schemes, there is a need to build the capacity of smallholders to achieve their aspirations through empowering women and improving access to physical assets and markets. Land tenure security concerns need addressing while supporting institutions that promote social interaction and learning remain vital for the growth of the smallholder irrigation sector. © 2018, © 2018 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the main livelihood option for development of region of Kazakhstan, which is characterised by small land-holdings, upland terrain, traditional cultivation practices, extensive irrigation, poor water conservation measures, middle productivity, limited crop diversification and low yields of food grains. 53% of the population in Kazakhstan is concentrated in rural areas and the economy is mostly based on agriculture produce with very limited industrialisation. This paper aims to perform SWOT analysis of agriculture sector of Kazakhstan. The study has been carried out by conducting SWOT-review and analysis of key characteristics of agri-business, management and land use in Kazakhstan in Turkestan region of Kazakhstan. It is found that agriculture sector is contributing a lot in region's GDP and there are many areas in which agriculture sector needs to grow and establish itself as a primary mean of development. By adopting the proposed solutions, agriculture sector can be developed significantly, its imports will decrease and exports will increase. The strength of the district lies with favorable environmental conditions, availability of labor, availability of agricultural lands. The weakness of the district include inadequate financial services, over-reliance on climatic conditions, poor post-harvest management practices and market conditions. The negative ramification of climate change, weak links between research, markets, and policy, insufficient political will towards the continuity of programs are serious threats.

	abstract = {Understanding the motivation that smallholders have for working and earning their livelihood is critical in enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural policies. This is especially important in a country like South Africa where social grant is an important source of unearned income. The study sought to find out what affects smallholders’ motivation to work by assessing the relationship between earned income, psychological capital and social grant dependency. We use data from 458 smallholders in four irrigation communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal and employ a complementary loglog fractional response model to analyse the data. The study revealed that endowment with positive psychological capital, gender, membership to an irrigation scheme and land ownership positively affect smallholders’ propensity to earn their livelihoods from farm and non-farm income. Social grant support and dependency ratio negatively affect the same. The findings support the thesis that, if not properly managed, social transfers can have a negative impact on smallholders’ motivation to work and earn their livelihoods, resulting in a dependency syndrome. Depending on the context, spatial differences can either positively or negatively affect farmers’ motivation to work. In conclusion, limited focus on the human and social capital development and hence psychological capital affect smallholders’ propensity to work. Small-scale irrigation schemes remain a viable option for increasing employment and incomes in the sector, whilst social and cultural norms continue to reduce women’s ability to engage in economic activities. The paper recommends the need to recognise the critical importance of psychological capital (mindset), streamline and improve targeting of social grant support, promote smallholder irrigation and invest in the infrastructure that enhances participation of women in economic activities. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal variability of water demand and supplies under different meteorological conditions and their linkage with dynamic groundwater (annually utilizable groundwater) reserve was investigated in a Canal Command (area irrigated by a canal system) of Eastern India. Annual irrigation water supply from surface water sources (i.e., canal, river lift and tanks) and groundwater sources (i.e., shallow and deep tubewells) was estimated for different meteorological conditions. Annual water demands as crop irrigation requirements (CIRs) for the prevailing cropping patterns in the study area were also assessed under different meteorological conditions using crop evapotranspiration and effective rainfall data. Thereafter, the estimated irrigation water supply and irrigation water demand were subjected to spatio-temporal and statistical analyses. The mean annual CIR in the study area was estimated at 7002 ± 852 MCM during 2004–2013 period. Boro paddy was found to be the most water-consuming crop, accounting for about 50% of the total crop water requirements. The mean annual dynamic groundwater reserve (DGWR) in the study area was estimated to be 5169 ± 782 MCM. Considering DGWR as an additional source of irrigation water, 28, 25 and 35 blocks were characterized as ‘water surplus’ during ‘normal,’ ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ years, respectively. Also, DGWR substantially reduced demand–supply gaps in the remaining blocks. The surplus water available in the blocks due to DGWR availability could be used to mitigate water-deficit condition in neighboring blocks. Thus, this study suggests cost-effective alternatives for the efficient management of available water resources and identifies management strategies for sustainable agricultural production under diverse climatic conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, Australia has been buying water entitlements and subsidising irrigation infrastructure to reallocate water from consumptive to environmental purposes in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). There is considerable evidence that irrigation infrastructure subsidies are not cost-effective, as well as questions as to whether water extractions are increasing (rebounding) as a result. We used 2481 on-farm MDB irrigation surveys and identified a ‘rebound effect’ on water extractions, with irrigators who received an irrigation infrastructure subsidy significantly increasing (21-28%) their water extraction, relative to those who did not receive any grants. Although the precise hydrological impact of this rebound effect on catchment and Basin-wide extractions remains unknown, publicly available water data suggest that reductions in extractions from the MDB – supposedly commensurate with increases in environmental flows – may have been overestimated, particularly in the Northern MDB. This overestimation may in turn be linked to issues with water measurement and extractions at the catchment and Basin-scale, which occur due to: (1) water theft and poor enforcement; (2) inaccurate or absent water metering; (3) growth in unlicensed surface and groundwater extractions and on-farm storage capacity; (4) legal and practical uncertainties in compliance tools, processes and water accounting; and (5) complexity of floodplain, evaporation and groundwater interactions. To respond to these water governance challenges, MDB water and rural policy actions must: (1) improve measurement of diversions and develop transparent and robust water accounting, independently audited and accounting for uncertainty; (2) improve compliance, fines and regulation; (3) use multiple lines of evidence for water accounting and compliance; and (4) prioritise the cost and environmental effectiveness of water recovery. © 2020 The Authors},

This study examines farmers’ enthusiasm towards one of such technologies in four south-western districts of Pakistan. The required information was obtained through a survey questionnaire administered to a sample of 283 groundwater users, and it was analysed descriptively and via an ordinary least squares regression technique. Results indicate that adopting water-saving technologies is less likely in the absence of incentives such as subsidized system installation, a reliable supplier who can provide warranties on the system’s service and spare parts and training the participating farmers. Besides, promoting such technologies would be relatively easier in the southern region due to those farmers’ relatively greater enthusiasm there compared with their northern counterparts. We conclude that promoting technologies such as drip irrigation may continue, but only as the mandatory initial step of a broad-based strategy aimed at nurturing water conservation values at the societal level. Among various possible interventions, enhancing water literacy is extremely important so that farmers discover and correct wasteful aspects inherent in their current irrigation practices, work through options to minimize those wastages, and develop a sense of water conservation as a collective social responsibility. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Traditionally, farmers either use, gasoline pump sets or electric motor pump set for the irrigation. To reduce the expenditure on the irrigation along with the carbon footprints, solar-based water pumping is nowadays getting popular. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of configurations and controls applied to develop efficient solar-based water pumping systems for irrigation in India.

This study contributes to literature in two aspects; we have conducted farm level survey in six districts (Rahim Yar Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Matiari, Shaheed Benazirabad and Sukkur) of two provinces (Punjab and Sindh) of Pakistan for three consecutive years (2014-15 to 2016-17) to assess the comparative advantage of Bt gene adoption over conventional cotton crop within and across provinces. Moreover, this study has assessed farmer’s wellbeing by comparing per capita income of farmers with poverty line. Results of panel data indicate that net yield gain from Bt gene cotton per acre is 33 to 37.5 % higher than conventional cotton gene. However, Bt cotton yield per acre is 13% higher in districts of Punjab than yield in districts of Sindh, this has resulted in huge gap between per capita incomes of Bt farmers in these provinces. Furthermore, Bt gene growers have significantly low pesticide applications as compared to conventional cotton producers. The results obtained from Cobb-Douglas production specification establish that irrigation cost, seed cost and fertilizer quantity have significant positive impact on over all cotton yield. This study suggests that awareness programs regarding refuge area and specification of seeds might improve yield as well as per capita income of farmers in Pakistan. © 2020 AESS Publications.

Agricultural enhancement in inland valleys, which undermines environmental sustainability, was assessed using ‘Driving Force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response’ approach in four agro-ecological zones of Benin. The survey revealed that inland valleys are largely devoid of ligneous species. Crop residues are mainly transferred from inland valley fields to feed cattle, burnt in situ by the farmers themselves or abandoned to wildfires or to pasture—not mulched. Crop diversification is not universal and is limited to rice and vegetables crops. Monocropping of rice, practised by 83.3% of inland valley farmers, requires large chemical fertilizer application despite their impacts on environment including land degradation and water contamination. A major challenge is to determine means of characterizing entire agro-ecosystems of inland valleys in a way that is simple enough to be effectively and efficiently monitored. Inland valley agricultural development projects might include backstopping activities and policies that enable monitoring of chemical inputs and farming practices in inland valleys to reduce negative impacts on the environment and human health. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Although participation in water markets is widespread among irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia, there has been a lack of study on the dynamics of water markets, in particular price and volume dynamics, volatility and spillovers. Questions have also been raised regarding the impact on markets from governments buying back permanent water from consumptive use to return to environmental use. VARX-BEKK-GARCH time-series regression was used to model the water market dynamics of monthly permanent and temporary water market trade from 1997 to 2017 in one of the largest water markets in the Murray-Darling Basin, the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District. Results suggest that the temporary market was more volatile than the permanent narket, while persistency in volatility only exists in permanent markets. Unidirectional transmission spillovers exists in both markets from prices to volumes. The main drivers of temporary water prices were water scarcity related, while permanent prices were most significantly influenced by previous permanent water prices and current temporary water market prices. A statistically significant negative impact on temporary volume-traded from government water recovery (e.g. a 1% increase in water recovery resulted in a 0.14% reduction in water volume-traded) was found, but no significant impact from government recovery was found on temporary water prices, nor on permanent market prices and volumes. However, government water recovery increased the volatility of temporary market prices and volumes, signaling potential increased issues of risk and uncertainty for irrigators engaging in temporary water markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The analysis is based on two data sources: the first is a unique district-season level panel dataset that we construct using multiple sources, and the second is unit record data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Surveys. To identify causal effects, we employ a difference-in-difference matching procedure, where districts are matched based on propensity scores; the use of propensity scores represents a novel aspect of this paper. We also examine pre-programme trends for each outcome variable to provide a check on the validity of our estimates. Our results indicate modest changes in cropping patterns that are state and period specific; however, they do not indicate any improvements in crop yields that were expected given the MGNREGA’s focus on investments in irrigation, although there is some evidence that irrigated area may have expanded after a lag. We also find that there is no systematic evidence of impact on wages and therefore no evidence that public works employment in MGNREGA crowded out casual labour in agriculture. © 2019, Indian Society of Labour Economics.},

	abstract = {The pressure of growing urbanization, industrialization and water scarcity resulting from climate change imposes limitations on the amount of water allocated to agriculture. There will need to be an increase in food production of almost 50% by 2030. This will be an enormous challenge, requiring a significant increase in irrigable land area in the forthcoming years. It is necessary to improve water 2 systems based on the knowledge that high efficiency can be achieved with less water only by the adoption of more effective water-management plans, especially in agriculture, which is the major consumer of this precious resource. Water management in agriculture has a dual task: improving both water networks and how treated wastewater is used and re-used. Farmer participation in water administration will play a key role in agricultural production growth. The paper highlights current concern regarding the management of water supply for irrigation from the River Arda in Piacenza province, Italy. The approach proposed by the Consorzio di Bonifica di Piacenza for the reduction of water loss in the irrigation network is the replacement of the traditional system of open canals with a new underground pipe system, to be available only for irrigation, in such a way that the hydrogeological structure of the territory would not be altered. The project's technical and economic feasibility depend on architectural quality and technical functionality. During the project phase tools and methods were also considered, seeking to involve techniques, materials and equipment that would make the pipe system less invasive and more affordable, efficient and manageable, not only regarding the final results, but also the project's development and construction stages, as well as its post-construction ordinary maintenance.

In turn, this important cultural dimension has recently been shown to affect the pattern of innovation across countries. However, the previous literature has not firmly connected agricultural legacies and innovation rates, and has consistently used low resolution data. We study the role of agricultural legacy for innovation performance using unique patent data from close to two thousand Chinese counties. We provide robust evidence that counties with a legacy of rice cultivation generate fewer patent applications than other counties, and a legacy of wheat production tends to be associated with more patent applications. The results for rice are robust to, e.g., controlling for temperature, precipitation, irrigation, disease burden, religiosity, and corruption, as well as accounting for migration patterns. Our results firmly establish the importance of agricultural legacy for shaping the culture of innovation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper examines the net effect of irrigation dams on infant mortality in South Africa. It relies on both fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches to counteract potential bias associated with non-random dam placement, with the latter approach predicting dam placement based on geographic features and policy changes. The analysis reveals that additional irrigation dams within South Africa's former homeland districts after Apartheid increased infant mortality by 10–20 percent. I then discuss and evaluate possible channels. Dam-induced increases in agricultural activity could increase water pollution and reduce water availability, and I provide supporting evidence that both channels may contribute.

	abstract = {American Indian reservations have low incomes and high rates of poverty relative to adjacent communities, and the income gap appears to be even larger for Indian farmers. We examine the extent to which a lack of access to capital might explain these differences using irrigation systems as a proxy for on-farm investment around the Uintah-Ouray Indian Reservation in eastern Utah. Uintah land is held in trust by the US government, and farmers on this land face significant barriers to acquiring capital to invest in irrigation equipment and infrastructure. We use the boundaries from a 1905 land allotment as a natural experiment, employing both sharp and fuzzy regression discontinuity designs to explore whether agricultural land use, irrigation levels, irrigation investment, and crop choice differ across the boundary. The original allocation provided similar land in the immediate neighborhood around its borders, and our results suggest that today tribal trust land is farmed and irrigated at rates similar to adjacent land. However, conditional on being irrigated, tribal trust land is around thirty-two percentage points less likely to utilize capital-intensive sprinkler irrigation, and up to ten percentage points less likely to grow high-value crops. Trust ownership, which is characterized by cumbersome bureaucratic processes, limits on agricultural lease flexibility, and the inability to use land as collateral to acquire loans, is a likely explanation for the observed differences. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association},

	abstract = {This paper sought to investigate the valuation of rice farmers’ preferences and willingness to pay for climate-smart agricultural technologies in Southeast Nigeria. Two objectives and one hypothesis guided the conduct of the study. The examination of rice farmers’ willingness-To-Pay (WTP) for improved CSA technology services revealed greater proportion of the respondents to be strongly not willing to pay for over 77.8% of the CSA technologies while barely 7.4% were mildly willing to pay. Rice farmers were strongly not willing to pay for the following CSA technologies: rainwater harvesting, cover crops method, directed seeded rice, systems of rice intensification, use of solar pumps, etc, while the CSA technologies they were mildly willing to pay for are drip irrigation and drainage management. The major reason for respondent’s unwillingness to pay were: poverty (2.0%) and CSA technologies as the responsibility of the Government to farmers within the state (5.0%). For the estimated willingness to pay value, the mean monthly minimum WTP in South-East was estimated at ₦5176.7123 while the mean monthly maximum WTP for rice farmers was estimated as ₦10,926.95. Water-smart technologies (76.8%) was mostly preferred CSA technology. Based on the ordered probit regression analysis of factors influencing willingness to pay for CSA technology, primary occupation (X5), access to credit (X8) and distance to market (X12) were found to be significant. The study recommended that rice farmers should adapt to climate change, natural resource pressure and contribute to mitigating climate change. © 2021 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The Lower Volta River Basin of Ghana is an important international and local tourism destination. Communities in the basin depend on shallow aquifer systems, the Volta River, and nearby streams as their sources of water for domestic purposes, cattle watering, and irrigation. Due to increasing human activities and limited information on water quality in the area, a holistic assessment of the quality of the water resources in the basin was conducted using hydrochemistry, δ2H and δ18O, principal components analysis, and selected indices. EC ranged from 141 to 19,370 μS/cm and 60.9–986 μS/cm for shallow groundwater and surface water respectively. NO3 − levels above 45–1049.9 mg/l were observed in 45% of analyzed wells. Na–Cl- and HCO3–Ca-dominant facies are identified. Silicate weathering, evaporite dissolution, cation exchange, and salinity are the hydrochemical processes influencing the shallow groundwater in the area. δ2H–δ18O‰ plot showed meteoric shallow groundwater recharge. Ion ratios, EC, and Cl− versus δ18O‰ relationships suggest dissolution and seawater intrusion as causes of groundwater salinity. Hydrochemistry, principal components analyses, and NO3 − versus δ18O showed evidence of anthropogenic pollution on water in the basin. All analyzed surface water and 79% of well samples were within suitable range for irrigation. Based on the CCMEWQI model criteria, 85% of the surface water were in good-to-excellent categories while majority of the shallow groundwater were in fair, marginal, and poor categories. The combined approach provided vital information on water quality in the basin. Strategic control measures were proposed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The agricultural sector is the main source of rural households’ food and revenue in Niger, and it contributes approximately 43% to the national GDP. However, there are several constraints to the sector’s development, including negative impacts of climate change. To mitigate these impacts, farmers implement a range of technical strategies. The extent of farmer’s awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts influences these strategies and hence farmers’ level of adaptation. This study was undertaken to assess farmers’ awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts in Aguie Department, Niger Republic. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. The results from a descriptive analysis show that the majority of respondents (84.4%) were aware of climate risks, but had differing perceptions of climate change impacts on production and annual revenue. A regression test revealed that climate-related information is highly significant in determining farmers’ awareness of climate change impacts. Most of the respondents reported negative impacts from climate change, and the majority, therefore, adjusted their farming system, albeit at different levels. A probit analysis shows that awareness, perception, education, crop production, soil fertility and annual revenue are highly influential on farmers’ climate change impacts adaptation. This research highlights farmer awareness and perceptions as key factors in the climate change impacts adaptation debate. The findings reveal that effective adaptation to climate change impacts is highly dependent on the extent of community awareness and how farmers perceive the impacts of climate change. The study highlights that institutions targeting households’ livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on media outreach in local languages, improving locally adapted extension services, and developing water use efficiency measures such as improved irrigation for effective and long-term adaptation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

However, recent studies in these countries indicate that this may partly be a result of the choice of payment vehicle, not the preference for the good. Thus, low WTP may not indicate a low welfare effect for public projects in developing countries. We argue that in a setting where 1) there is imperfect substitutability between money and other measures of wealth (e.g., labor), and 2) institutions are perceived to be corrupt, including payment vehicles that are currently available to the individuals and less prone to corruption may be needed to obtain valid welfare estimates. Otherwise, we risk underestimating the welfare benefit of projects. We demonstrate this through a rural household contingent valuation (CV) survey designed to elicit the value of access to reliable irrigation water in Ethiopia. Of the total average annual WTP for access to reliable irrigation service, cash contribution comprises only 24.41%. The implication is that socially desirable projects might be rejected based on cost-benefit analysis as a result of welfare gain underestimation due to mismatch of payment vehicles choice in valuation studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Developing new varieties by integrating traits in high demand by farmers could greatly increase farmers’ adoption of new varieties. This study aims to inform breeding priority setting by examining farmers’ preferences for coffee traits. A Discrete Choice Experiment was applied to smallholder farmers in northern Ethiopia to map their willingness-to-pay for improvements in four coffee traits: i) yield, ii) weather tolerance, iii) disease resistance, and iv) the maturity period. The traits are important to the farmers in their choice of coffee varieties. They prefer weather tolerant and disease resistant varieties; implying that they prefer yield stability over high yielding and early maturing varieties. Education level, access to irrigation and farmers’ experience in coffee farming explain the preference heterogeneity across farmers. These results suggest that breeding programs should give priority to yield stability in order to increase farmers’ adoption of new varieties, and secure in situ preservation of these traits. Thus, ex situ conservation programs are needed for early maturing and high yielding varieties, which farmers do not give priority to maintain in their own fields. This would improve climate resilience of coffee farming, and at the same time conserve the Arabica coffee genetic heritage of Ethiopia. © Firenze University Press.},

	abstract = {As attention to individual responsibility and the potential for self-realization through responsibilization grows, there is a need for better understanding of how environmental governance is also changing. In considering changes in community forestry priorities, from reversing deforestation to environmental governance, it is essential to understand how environmental responsibilities are being shifted to individuals and how people react to particular environmental conditions within such changes. In community forestry, farmers` decisions to receive and provide environmental services are guided by rational choices and market mechanisms. This study assessed how farmers value irrigation water supply services from community forests based on the economic and environmental importance of these services. The study also investigated whether responsibilization persists and reframes individual choices to pay for environmental services. Rajapani community forest user group in Rupandehi district, Nepal, was selected for the study due to its ongoing procedures to supply water for irrigation in the village. For data collection farmers were purposively selected to represent different well-being status, gender and distance of paddy field from the water source. Contingent valuation and focus group discussions were employed as research methods. The study revealed that mean willingness of the farmers to pay was USD 77.13 per ha per year for irrigation water. Distance from paddy field to water source, well-being status, education, age, gender and caste of the farmers were tested against willingness to pay (WTP). Pearson correlation tests showed distance of paddy field from water source, well-being status and gender have a substantial influence on the individual's WTP. Farmers also expressed substantial concern for the sustainability of water resources, and were exposed to responsibilizing discourses mainly because they were willing to emphasize personal action to respond to the situation and overcome potential imposed threats of climate change. The shifting forms of environmental governance have implications for responsibilizing service providers and receivers in payment for environmental services, and opens a new discourse in community forestry. © 2020},

	abstract = {Apulia has a considerable demand of irrigation water, however high inefficiency levels of the collective water networks force most of the regional farms to use groundwater, with a consequent worsening of its quality, as well as of soil and crops characteristics. Therefore, the use of sustainable supply methods for irrigation water is desirable both through improvements of the collective networks and by appropriate economic tools. However, making the correct choices in these matters requires knowledge concerning the effects of the present water supply systems on the economic performance of farms. The objective of this study is to measure and compare the technical efficiency of winegrowing farms in northern Apulia that use different supply systems for irrigation water: groundwater from private wells, irrigation water from collective networks, and irrigation water from both private wells and collective networks. The results enable to understand if and how different supply systems of irrigation water affect the management of productive factors and inputs. These findings also provide useful information for appropriate policies aimed at preserving groundwater and its externalities, as well as at improving the economic performance of Apulian farms.

	abstract = {Groundwater irrigation using electric pumps plays a key role in India's agricultural water supply. Power utilities across different states use two common tariff modes to charge groundwater consumers: flat tariffs, where payments are fixed according to a pump's power rating, and metered tariffs based on units of power actually consumed. In this review, we use empirical evidence from past studies across multiple jurisdictions in India to compare the two tariff structures in terms of three key features: administrative burden on utilities; equity of groundwater access between high-income and low-income farmers; and influence on farmers’ pumping behavior. Our analysis shows that flat tariffs have low administrative costs and more equitable distributional outcomes, but provide no incentive to farmers for water conservation. Conversely, metered tariffs have the potential to encourage judicious consumption, but are expensive to manage and disadvantageous to low-income farmers who often buy water from wealthier groundwater well owners. Flawed tariff policies, in conjunction with large subsidies for agricultural power, have caused rapid groundwater depletion in many regions as well as massive financial losses to power utilities and governments – both state and central. Since there is considerable heterogeneity in agricultural practices and groundwater availability across India, we propose location-specific strategies for rationalizing agricultural power tariffs in different regions. While the groundwater-abundant eastern regions can benefit from a hybrid flat-cum-metered tariff that encourages farmer-to-farmer water sales, western states facing unsustainable groundwater exploitation should develop tariff policies that ration power, prioritize its supply during the most critical seasons, and reward farmers who reduce their groundwater consumption. Not only will such tariff policies help conserve groundwater, but also augment government financial resources for social welfare programs such as education, health, energy access etc. Thus, improved power policies can provide substantial assistance in India's progress towards multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Although poverty headcount ratio is high among the upper reach farmers, depth, and severity of poverty is more among middle reach farmers. Land size per se is not a significant variable in determining access, but the access is conditioned by sources of non-farm income, credit facility, education and caste hierarchy. While small farmers used more water per acre for irrigation without commensurate economic productivity, the differences in their economic productivity in comparison to large farmers was found to be associated with inequality. © Srinivasan and Nuthalapati 2019.},

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) came out to be significant and positive only in the case of few practices in some States. The welfare outcome results showed that the adoption increased the yield and income of three out of four practices-plant plus water, plant plus soil and plant plus water plus soil management.

	abstract = {Safe tea production conducted under the standards of Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practices has been strongly encouraged by the Vietnam government. However, there is no study on profit efficiency of safe tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the safe tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self-selection in assessing the profit efficiency of safe and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74%, suggesting 26% of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt safe tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers’ production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Smallholder rainfed agriculture, which is the mainstay of rural communities in Ethiopia, is negatively affected by climate change. Understanding the adaptations being practiced and factors which determine decision in adoption is vital in designing viable strategies. A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to collect data from 384 randomly selected smallholder farmers to identify adaptation measures being undertaken and to estimate the prominent determinants in the adoption of adaptations in drought-prone areas of north-central Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using percentage, weighted mean index, Chi-square test, t test and multinomial regression model and triangulated with thematic analysis. Around 96% of the respondents have perceived a change in climate and 65.4% employed adaptation measures. Stone/soil bund, changing the farming calendar and switching to short maturing varieties are the most widely practiced adaptations. Barriers inhibiting smallholder farmers from taking adaptation measures were financial constraint, lack of affordable technologies, lack of knowledge, limited access to early warning, uncertainty about the future, shortage of land and scarcity of water. The results from the multinomial discrete choice model revealed that age and educational level of the head, family size, herd size, access to training, access to microfinance, extension services, remittance and perceiving that climate change can be adapted influenced the selection of adaptations. Overcoming financial constraint, strengthening extension service, providing timely information and early warning, intensifying irrigation, integration of non-farm sources of livelihood in the farming system and land resource management would enable to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Africa rely heavily on rainfed agriculture. Those who have access to irrigation often receive it at no charge, but quantity, frequency and reliability may be limited without adequate revenue for maintenance and operation. Moreover, the absence of fees means that there are no pricing signals to encourage conservation of this scarce resource. In a situation where farmers do not pay for irrigation water use, this study investigates demand-side issues by eliciting farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for access to irrigation water. This study employs choice experiment (CE) and contingent valuation methods (CVMs) to value access to irrigation water, taking Ethiopia as a case in point. Unlike previous studies, this study covers current users and non-users of irrigation water using the same baseline (status quo) conditions-no irrigation-and compares the preferences of these two groups. The four attributes identified in the CE are number of crop seasons, frequency of watering in a season, crop type, and payment level. Results show that marginal WTP was Birr 17.7 (US 0.98), 261.8 (US 14.54) and 87.6 (US 4.87) for number of crop seasons, watering frequency in a season and crop type, respectively. Our estimates of farmers' WTP for operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes per hectare of irrigated land range from Birr 738 (US 41.00) (from the CE) to Birr 784 (US 43.56) (from the CVM). We also find that, compared to current users, non-users were willing to pay more in general, as well as for the number of crop seasons specifically. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how climate change strategies and resource conflicts are shaping each other in the Greater Aural region of western Cambodia. Agro-industrial projects linked to climate change goals are reshaping both social and ecological dynamics, by altering patterns of access to land and water resources as well as the nature of the resources themselves. Using a landscape perspective, we investigate these social and ecological changes occurring across space and time. Drawing on data from community researchers, field visits, interviews and secondary sources, we examine two kinds of connections between climate change responses and resource conflicts in the Greater Aural: 1) demand for biofuels as a driver of flex crop expansion; and 2) the construction of irrigation infrastructure as a climate change adaptation strategy. Findings include that some impacts of flex crop expansion and irrigation systems are local and immediate, for example when villagers lose land, plantation workers are not paid, and cassava processing pollutes local water supplies. Other impacts are transferred to different locations or deferred to the future, for example when changes in water quality and quantity affect those living downstream, or when soil degraded by cassava production becomes unproductive for future generations. We conclude that climate change strategies are now deeply entangled with resource conflicts in the Greater Aural region. Adopting a landscape perspective and working directly with community researchers opens new pathways for identifying not only site-specific, but also cumulative and shifting impacts of climate change strategies and their relationship to resource conflicts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The state has a predominantly agrarian economy, and agriculture is the mainstay of about two-thirds of the workforce. Interestingly, only 28 per cent of the net cultivable area in the state is irrigated, compared to the national average of 49.8 per cent. With the aim to improve irrigation facilities and increase agricultural productivity, the state government implemented the solar photovoltaic water pumping system (SPVWPS) in 2008-09 as an appropriate alternative to grid-connected water pumping. The aim of this paper is to assess the costs and benefits of adopting the SPVWPS using data from a field survey of 126 households. The findings show that use of the SPVWPS offers substantial benefits to adopters in the long run. In addition, government subsidy plays a major role in determining the payback period of adopters' investment in the scheme. The paper suggests that, alongside timely implementation of the scheme, the government should facilitate domestic manufacturing of solar cells and panels to fully harness social benefits of the SPVWPS.

	abstract = {Recycled water is one potential solution to meeting the growing demand for irrigation water in the U.S. and worldwide. However, widespread adoption of recycled water by agriculture will depend on consumers’ acceptance of food crops grown with this water. In a revealed-preference dichotomous-choice framed field experiment, this study elicits consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for fresh produce irrigated with recycled water. It also evaluates consumers’ behavioral responses to information about benefits and potential risks of recycled irrigation water. The results suggest that consumers are less willing to pay for produce irrigated with recycled water than for produce irrigated with water of an unspecified type. Information about potential risks associated with recycled water reduces consumers’ WTP by nearly 50% while information about its environmental benefits does not have a substantial impact. However, a behavioral intervention that presents individuals with a balanced information treatment leads to a 30% increase in mean WTP for produce irrigated with recycled water relative to the experimental control. However, this effect is only found with vegetables and not with fruit, perhaps because fruit is usually consumed raw. Most of the demographic characteristics analyzed in the experiment did not influence consumers’ likelihood of purchasing produce irrigated with recycled water; the exception was presence of a child in the household—those consumers were less likely to purchase produce, particularly fruits, irrigated with recycled water. Finally, consumers experience welfare gains from a labeling policy that provides information about the use of recycled irrigation water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study is to estimate the impacts of access to irrigation on farm income, household income and income diversification. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to address the selection bias arising from both observed and unobserved factors and analyze cross-sectional data collected from Fujian, Henan and Sichuan provinces in China. The authors use the Simpson index to measure household income diversification. The propensity score matching (PSM) model and control function approach are also used for comparison purpose. Findings: After controlling for the selection bias, the authors find that access to irrigation has a positive and statistically significant impact on rural incomes and diversification. The treatment effects of access to irrigation are to increase farm income, household income and income diversification by around 14, 10 and 107%, respectively. The positive effects of access to irrigation are confirmed by the estimates of the PSM model and control function approach. Further analysis reveals that the irrigation effects on rural incomes and diversification are heterogeneous between small-scale and large-scale farmers and between male-headed and female-headed households. Practical implications: The authors’ findings suggest that the government should continue to improve irrigation infrastructure construction in rural China to promote smallholder farmers' water access and at the same time facilitate farmers' access to better agronomic and irrigation information. There exist gender and farm size related income and diversification effects of access to irrigation, and the irrigation access is associated with farm location. Thus, when developing regional irrigation programs consideration needs to be taken of whether the rural farming systems are dominated by male/female household heads and land fragmentation/consolidation issues. Originality/value: Although a large body of literature has investigated the effects of irrigation development in rural areas, little is known about the impact of access to irrigation on income diversification.

	abstract = {Irrigation is a lynchpin of rural development strategies and a key input to improving productivity and farm incomes, the key source of livelihood for the majority of the world's poor. Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wheat is South Africa’s second most important grain crop and is produced in winter rainfall, summer rainfall, and irrigation regions. Despite being a net importer of wheat, the country has stringent wheat quality requirements as per the Agricultural Products Act (Act No. 119 of 1990). This paper investigates the effects of the quality requirements in different regions and the wheat industry as whole. Forward regression and benefit–cost analysis were applied to data on wheat area planted, seed adoption rates, prices, and cultivar performance from 1999 to 2016. A total of 31 527 observations from winter, summer and irrigation regions were used, each accounting for 4563, 8824 and 18 140 cases respectively. Forty-nine cultivars were used for trials during this period. Results show that stringent quality requirements have resulted in losses of approximately 39 000 tons from 1999 to 2016. The benefits of pursuing the prevailing quality standards amounted to R400 million while the costs amounted to R514 million, far exceeding the benefits. The resulting benefit–cost ratio was 0.78, implying that for every rand invested in breeding for quality alone, 22 cents is lost. It can be concluded that government intervention through quality standards has led to more losses than gains. In addition, investments made towards quality improvement alone have not been recovered due to the high standards. There are therefore cogent reasons to consider relaxing the quality standards to allow for higher wheat outputs, thus unlocking growth in local wheat production. © 2019, © 2019 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

The multitude of stakeholders involved in governing Bangkok's food system is not just inter-related, but also linked and connected from top-to-bottom. These stakeholders include central and local governments, large food corporations, civil society organizations and even the daily life practices of street food venders and mobile markets. As a result, the article suggests, the governance of the city food agenda in Bangkok is both empowered and participatory, because organizations from the top and the middle are unable to sustain the development of food systems without including ordinary people in the actions taken to create them. This suggests legal frameworks, plans and related infrastructure development, are insufficient for Bangkok be smart in sustaining the development of cities food systems. As while the public sector facilitates food production and distribution through the regionalization process (including the conservation of the peri-urban agriculture, irrigation systems development, and central fresh food markets establishment), the smart city food agenda still requires operations from below to sustain such technical innovations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Despite the advantages that tomato production has on the economic balance of Tunisia, it may present an environmental pressure on the natural ecosystem. The main objective of this research is to determine the environmental impacts of soilless geothermal conventional multi-tunnel cherry tomato production located in Chenchou (South-West of Tunisia) using life cycle assessment methodology. The functional unit considered is one ton of soilless cherry tomato produced. The system boundaries included: (1) energy, (2) fertigation (3) pesticides (3) transport (4) crop maintenance (Pruning, harvesting, CO2 injects) (5) greenhouse setting-up and (6) waste treatment. The inventory data were collected from the farm exploitation. Ten impact categories were computed using International Reference Life Cycle Data System impact assessment methodology. The results obtained showed that fertilizers and energy sub-systems are the most contributing in the majority of the impacts. The production of 1 ton of tomato emits about 954 kg CO2-eq. Moreover, waste treatment sub-system engendered an avoided global warming, land use, water resources depletion and abiotic resources depletion potential impacts. Finally, the studied system presented a relatively low water footprint due to the use of geothermal water for irrigation. The sensitivity analysis showed that substituting electricity source from natural gas to renewable sources (biomass, photovoltaics and hydropower) could improve the environmental performance of the tomato production system. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

We note the rapid increase in private investment based on the agricultural census, mostly pumps and shallow tube wells, and the increase in investments on communals in the last decade. With the recurring and persistent problems on planning and investment, design and management, and operation and maintenance, we call for the rethinking of the way we develop and manage our agricultural water resources. Despite all the concerns, there are paths to improving water management and increasing water productivity, some of which are currently being pursued.

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystem service (PES) schemes have become increasingly popular in attempting to promote ecological stewardship and conservation behaviour through provisioning of economic incentives often as market-inspired transactions. The scholarship and empirical application of PES schemes has tended to focus on contract design and conditionality of payments rather than more fundamentally examining whether incentives do indeed influence behaviour in desired ways. In this paper, a set of incentive framed treatments are introduced to existing collective action institutions promoting common pool resource management in order to explore the effects of incentive provision on the propensity to participate in the maintenance of collectively owned irrigation canals. The experiments take place in the Kyrgyz Republic, characterized by the historic transition of nomadic collective traditions, subsequent Soviet rule, to advances towards democracy, market integration, and the first PES pilot in the country. In the incentive treatments provided, we reveal the close interplay between the framing of incentives, the influence of village leaders mobilizing collective activity and social norms of reciprocity, trust and enforcement in mobilizing collective work. Each framed case study exhibits a unique configuration of individual motivations, group norms and other regarding rationalities, providing critical insight into this new frontier of PES implementation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The water consumption cut is equivalent to 16–31 % of the ultimate capacity of the South-North Water Transfer Project. Much of the reduction is achievable at the populous and water-stressed North China Plain and Northeast China. Meanwhile, the interventions can increase maize production by an estimated 7–15 %, meeting 22–28 % of demand increase projected for 2050.

	abstract = {Crop-water production functions are important tools for quantifying effects of water scarcity and climate change on agricultural production, and are also widely used within hydro-economic models to support design of inter-sectoral water management policies. Here, we introduce a new methodology for simulating crop-water production functions using process-based crop growth models, which captures explicitly the interacting effects of farmers' intraseasonal irrigation decision-making, stochastic weather conditions, and physical and socio-economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water. Through a case study application for groundwater irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains, we demonstrate that constraints to irrigation scheduling caused by aquifer depletion, combined with farmers' limited foresight of future weather conditions, have significant impacts on estimated seasonal crop-water production functions. Our results highlight that the failure to account for these factors fully in previous simulation approaches will lead to errors in estimates of the impacts of groundwater depletion on farmers' future resilience to drought and climate change. Our proposed simulation methodology is generalizable to different production systems or crop growth models, and provides a tool for assessing how economic benefits derived from irrigation vary spatially and temporally due to heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and irrigation practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Irrigation systems in many Asian countries including the Philippines remain heavily dependent on public funds and are mostly unsustainable. Systematic degradation due to poor and inadequate management, maintenance and operation, and limited public funding calls for a new approach. Governments have implemented participatory irrigation management, which evolved into an irrigation management transfer (IMT). While progress has been slow, the IMT appear to present some improvements in the irrigation sector. However, the lack of incentives and motivation for irrigators associations (IAs) to become autonomous and irrigation agencies’ unwillingness to let go further slows the growth of the irrigation sector. For the irrigation sector to grow fast and to provide the right incentives and policy environment for both farmers and IAs in the Philippines, the next logical step to take is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the responsible public agency and IAs. This paper explores the potential of establishing a PPP by empowering existing IAs beyond the IMT to become viable and sustainable private companies. This paper proposes four financial options for the irrigators associations-irrigation service management company (IAs-ISMC) to become more independent from public subsidies. These financial options are defined, which include doing community work beyond the PPP contracts to generate additional funds to the irrigation service fees (ISF). Necessary policy measures and institutional arrangements are proposed to enable the establishment of a start-up private company. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the factors that influence rice farmers' decisions to adopt crop insurance and premium payments (willingness to pay [WTP] amounts). The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of the complementary log-log (cloglog) truncated Poisson double-hurdle model as an alternative hurdle model. Design/methodology/approach: The study first investigated the nature of the dependent variable, which had non-normal residuals and was overdispersed. The probit truncated normal regression double-hurdle model was tried but it failed the normality and homoscedasticity tests; hence, the cloglog truncated Poisson double-hurdle model was employed in the study. Findings: An estimated 61% of respondents would purchase crop insurance, despite farmers not having prior experience with this product. Amongst others, the factors that influence insurance adoption amongst rice farmers are the share of rice in total income, reliability perception of crop insurance schemes and the probability of failure to achieve target yields. The latter helps the authors to address adverse selection, a central issue to the viability of such an insurance programme. The determinants of farmers' WTP are also identified. Research limitations/implications: Sampling was limited to farmers using irrigation and living in one region of Ghana, which may limit the study’s wider applicability. Originality/value: As far as the authors are aware, this study is the first to select the appropriate hurdle model based on established properties of the dependent variable on this topic – crop insurance decisions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper analysed the effects of adopting ecosystem-based farm management practices (EBFMPs) on the livelihoods of irrigation farmers in Africa, using Ghana as a case study. The paper employed mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative techniques) for purposes of triangulation and cross validation of the issues. Data were collected using key informant interviews, focus group discussions and administration of a questionnaire to 300 households. A treatment effect model was employed to estimate the effects of adopting EBFMPs on livelihoods of farmers. Specifically, the average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) were estimated and found to be positive and significant. This means that the adoption of EBFMPs has positive and significant implications for farmers’ livelihoods. The paper therefore recommends that irrigation farmers should be educated on the importance of using ecosystem-friendly irrigation practices as this is critical for sustainable livelihood development of the poor and vulnerable, especially irrigators in Ghana who rely on the exigencies of the weather to survive. Irrigation farmers should also be educated on the functioning of irrigation landscape (in terms of water flow from up-stream area to down-stream), and how their activities and practices affect the irrigation water supply system. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The influence of agricultural technologies on the growth of agricultural value-added based on time series data of Bihar (India) over the period 1990-2016 has been examined in this paper. The technological progress appears to be a major determinant of boosting the potential productivity of land and affecting positively the economic growth. The results indicated that there are significant and certain benefits from the utilization of a system of technological innovations including mechanization, renewed capital stocks, as well as transfer of new knowledge to farmers' and permanent cropping practices. Farming practices involving crop rotation, multi-cropping, and agro forestry are recommended to sustain agricultural sustainability since they seem to be economically viable and environmentally friendly. It was found that technological innovations pertaining to soil conditions, irrigation systems and chemical fertilizers might be beneficial to agricultural production growth in the long-term when they are managed in accordance with soil characteristics and in a balanced way. The results also showed that the labour force, the forest area, the amount of credits to agriculture, and the amount of energy consumed to power irrigation are likely to be insignificant to boost directly the growth of agricultural value-added. Thus, it is recommended that Bihar makes a large scale investment in agricultural capital and carry on renewal at opportune moments so as to keep steady the positive trend of the agricultural growth over the years. The investment may be in terms of mechanized technologies, supporting infrastructure and appropriating the knowledge relating to their management; and adopting new farming technologies and practices involving crop rotation, multi-cropping and agro-forestry so as to sustain the growth of agricultural value added. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {Vulnerability in agriculture is influenced, among others, by extended periods of water shortage in regions exposed to droughts. In order to assess irrigation water requirements, remote sensing (RS) techniques are integrated for the estimation and monitoring of cotton crop evapotranspiration ETc. Cotton fields in a small agricultural sub-catchment in Thessaly, Central Greece, are used as an experimental site. Daily meteorological data and weekly field data are recorded throughout seven (2004–2010) growing seasons for the computation of reference evapotranspiration ETo, crop coefficient Kc and cotton crop ETc based on conventional data, which are compared during the corresponding period with the satellite-based method (Landsat TM) for the estimation of cotton crop coefficient Kc and cotton crop ETc, which also delineates its spatiotemporal variability. The methodology is applied for monitoring Kc and ETc during growing season in the selected sub-catchment. Several error statistics are used showing very good agreement with ground-truth observations.

We develop a flexible rainfall-Temperature drought index that captures all dry events and we classify these as Type 1 (above-Average cooling degree days) and Type 2 droughts (below-Average cooling degree days). Applied to a panel dataset of Indian districts over 1966-2009, Type 2 droughts are found to have negative marginal impacts comparable to those of Type 1 droughts. Irrigation more effectively reduces Type 2 drought-induced yield losses than Type 1 yield losses. Over time, Type 1 drought losses have declined while Type 2 losses have risen. Estimates of average yield losses due to Type 1 droughts are reduced by up to 27 per cent when Type 2 droughts are omitted. The associated ex-post economic costs in terms of rice production are underestimated by up to 124 per cent.  Copyright © The Author(s) (2020). Published by Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {In the last 40 years in sub-Saharan Africa, huge investments have been made in inland valley (IV) development for agricultural production. Understanding the agricultural and socioeconomic impacts of IV development may help develop strategies for modernization and optimization of irrigation systems. A farmers’ perception approach was used to analyze the impacts of IV development on agricultural and hydraulic performances and on farmers’ socioeconomic conditions in the circle of Sikasso, Mali. Data were collected through focus group discussions, field visits and participatory observations in 37 inland valleys of which 17 were developed. The two main water control systems observed in developed inland valleys were (1) controlled submersion with bunded plots dedicated to rice and (2) spate irrigation regulated by weirs and cofferdams. Compared to undeveloped inland valleys, controlled submersion and spate irrigation expanded the cultivated area in the rainy season. In the dry season, crop extension was observed only in spate irrigation schemes. Higher crop productivity was observed in inland valleys located close to an urban market and in valleys cultivated during the off-season. Spate irrigation is widespread in bigger inland valleys with more water resources and is often associated with the cultivation of higher value off-season crops. Consequently, we observed farmers had individual and collective investment capacity in spate irrigation schemes than in controlled submersion and undeveloped inland valleys. The study highlighted the importance of re-thinking the design of water control facilities to enable crop diversification to improve the livelihoods of inland valley-dependent communities. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

How well 14 WUAs operated was evaluated based on surveys and related interviews. The methodology of this study consisted of two main steps: (i) an estimation of the technical efficiency scores of 90 smallholder farmers and the sub-vector of WUE (Water Use Efficiency) using a nonparametric DEA model, and (ii) a regression of a Tobit model to test the hypothesis regarding explanatory variables of differentiated technical efficiency scores. The investigation showed an average technical efficiency of 70.8% and WUE of 64.8%. It highlighted the water turn, state of infrastructure, water supply shortage, corruption and free-riding behaviors as factors tightly correlated with a farm’s productivi-ty. This suggests that there is potential to improve production efficiency by implementing targeted programs and rules for inefficient farmers. The findings of this study show that it is important to fight corruption in the water sector by increased government oversight, reformed regulations that stimulate performance, and increased accountability towards citizens through greater participation in decision making. © 2021, Bononia University Press.

	abstract = {Small-scale irrigation (SSI) technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability. A farm simulation model (FARMSIM) and data from selected SSI technologies piloted in northern Ghana under the ‘Feed the Future-Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation’ (ILSSI) project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the SSI technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households. Three dry season irrigated crops (onion, corchorus, amaranthus) grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed. Results show that adoption of the SSI technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154%–608% against the baseline depending on the ‘crop type - SSI technology’ combination. Nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs. However, the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital-intensive SSI technologies such as solar-powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost. Currently, farmers tend to choose low-cost SSI technologies such as a traditional watering-cans, which generate low economic returns. Improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market-oriented high-value irrigated production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {There are a number of potential pathways leading from agricultural input decisions to nutrition outcomes of farm households. These have special resonance in less developed areas of South Asia given widespread undernutrition problems, market failures and restricted access to land and other key assets and inputs, as well as ongoing debates around the implications that the green revolution has held for nutritional outcomes. A number of initiatives, including the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) project have been undertaking research that addresses these linkages. The objectives of this paper are to systematically review the recent evidence on linkages between agricultural inputs and diet and nutrition outcomes of farm households in South Asia, place relevant LANSA research within the context of this review, and draw implications for policy, practice and the future research agenda. We focus on land and livestock assets and the set of productivity enhancing inputs in the form of irrigation, seed and agrochemicals. We report on a systematic review of recent evidence based on observational data on the links between these agricultural inputs and assets and diet and nutrition outcomes of farm households in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal. We find that the literature has slowly but steadily grown since previous reviews conducted in the early 2010s, but that there is still a long way to go. Review results suggest that while there is no indication that land ownership or size by themselves have clear associations with farm household dietary or nutrition outcomes, land productivity is more clearly associated with improved outcomes. Yet the literature linking specific inputs such as improved seeds or irrigation with nutrition remains very thin. The literature appears strongest for the case of links between livestock keeping and dietary and nutrition outcomes. This is particularly the case with animals reared for milk, with the evidence indicating milch animal ownership improves household milk intakes and thereby influences the growth of children. Priorities for future research include the formulation and testing of more specific hypotheses relating to input-nutrition linkages and more strenuous efforts to improve causal identification in this literature. © 2018 The Authors},

The paper examined employment along gender, impact of materials and proportion of female employment in African agriculture. Design/methodology/approach: Time series econometrics was employed in the framework of production function analysis involving 36 years of data. Findings: Results show that world labour in agriculture decreased from 49.77 to 40.04% but increased from 12.43 to 16.94% in Africa. World female employment in agriculture ranged from 40.56 to 42.81% and from 40.40 to 43.02% in developing economies, but decreased from 40.39 to 36.08% in developed economies. Total agricultural labour in Africa was negatively and significantly related to agricultural gross production index number (APIN). Research limitations/implications: Interaction of cattle stock and females employed in agriculture was positive and significant at pooled African values. Interaction of irrigation facilities and female labour was positive and significant in West Africa. Interaction of cattle stock and total labour in Southern Africa had negative relationship with APIN. Interaction of total labour and irrigation had negative relationship with APIN in Africa. Insufficient agricultural facilities in terms of cattle stock and irrigation infrastructure for the populace exist. It recommends increased investments to expand irrigated lands and livestock. Practical implications: African governments need to use good political will to effect the needed transformation in agriculture. It is possible for agriculture to offer lucrative employment to both males and females in less developed world as in developed economies. Originality/value: The paper noted very limited agricultural facilities in terms of cattle stock and irrigation facilities for the populace engaged in agriculture.

We then show that the rainfall-conflict link is attenuated by the presence of irrigation infrastructure in a district. This attenuating effect is specific to irrigation infrastructure; we find no evidence for a similar effect of hydropower dams. Our results are stronger for small-scale conflicts over natural resources and popular justice than for conflicts over ethnic identity or ethnic separatism. These results are robust to controlling for interactions between rainfall and a wide range of socio-economic and geographic district characteristics.

We experimentally investigate the potential of water users’ self-governance in enhancing their contributions to a common pool as opposed to external regulation. Our focus is on the irrigated areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Due to their Soviet past, these countries have a reputation for low bottom-up cooperation potential. Based on the different pre-Soviet irrigation traditions of the two study sites, we assess the effectiveness of short-term incentives compared to long term cultural factors of cooperation. History might matter, but we find it does not predetermine the success of current water decentralization in ancient as compared to relatively recently established irrigation sites. Our study reveals that external regulation, in fact, decreases farmers’ cooperation, whereas face-to-face communication increases it. This finding calls into question the top-down approach prevalent in current water policies of the region. Moreover, it suggests the viability of endogenous cooperation and hence encourages the implementation of truly self-governed water management policies in Central Asia. However, the substantial heterogeneity in individual contributions apparent at the village level also signals a warning that one-size-fits-all approaches to local cooperation are unlikely to succeed. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Concern about sustained availability of fresh groundwater for agricultural use in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) mounts as groundwater levels decline. We evaluate the elasticities of demand for groundwater and other agricultural inputs, as well as the overall and output-specific economies of scale for four major irrigated commodities (rice, corn, soybeans, and cotton) in the MAP region. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of two groundwater management policy scenarios, including increasing pumping cost and groundwater use restrictions, on irrigation behavior. The results show price elasticity of demand for groundwater to be -0.13, indicating that it is inelastic, and an increased cost of pumping will not significantly decrease the relative demand for groundwater in the region. Even with policy scenarios that either increase the costs of pumping significantly or restrict groundwater use in the region, groundwater demand still appears to be inelastic. We also document significant overall economies of scale in the region. Our findings have implications for potential policy options aimed at reducing groundwater use. Efficient management practices are important to increase aquifer recharge, and considering human behavior via economic analysis will improve projections of groundwater availability in the MAP region.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {We study how institutions such as water rights can complement new irrigation technologies in promoting the sustainability of U.S. agriculture. Using data from the Ogallala-High Plains Aquifer region of Kansas, we find that water extraction moderately increases after adopting Low Energy Precise Application (LEPA) irrigation, and this rebound effect is in general higher for farmers with larger water rights. About half of the LEPA's rebound effects arise because adopters tend to irrigate more land and grow more water-intensive crops, with the remaining half attributable to more intensive irrigation. Farmers with greater water rights use more water, with two-thirds of the effects arising from irrigating larger land areas, and one-third of the effects attributable to more intensive irrigation. A 10% reduction of water rights will reduce water use by 5% in the long run, and if the reduction targets the majority of the water rights, which lie between 100 and 500 AF, LEPA's rebound effect decreases by 15.4%. Finally, we find that farmers have an incentive to apply a small amount of water in order to preserve their water rights, but the associated water waste is insignificant. © The Author(s) 2018.},

First, an input-orient-ed data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to measure the relative efficiency scores of WUAs and to evaluate the management and maintenance costs sub-vectors efficiencies separately through a mathemat-ical modification in the initial DEA specification. In a second stage, critical determinants of sub-vector efficiency are determined by applying a Tobit model. A key finding of the study is that WUAs are clearly inefficient. Results show that on average, 36% of the used inputs (management and maintenance costs) could be saved if the WUAs operated on the frontier. The inefficiency found can be mainly attributed to the number of water pumping stations managed, the ratio of water losses and the WUAs’ age. The results also show a discrepancy between the technical efficiency values calculated under the CRS and VRS as-sumptions, resulting in a 20% scale inefficiency. The study also revealed that the sub-vector inefficiency of WUAs is linked more to engineering inefficiencies than to inefficiencies in their management. © 2021, Bononia University Press.

This paper explores perceptions of local people on changes in the use and management of floodplain fisheries, using a case study of Pak Peung wetland commons in Lao PDR. The wetland is seasonally inundated from the Mekong River; however, fish migration has been impacted by irrigation development and increasing fishing pressure. Local fishing practices, knowledge and views were captured to inform co-management strategies, including the first fishway designed for Mekong River fish species. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2011 with 81 households from six villages around the wetland. The survey was repeated in 2015 to ascertain any changes in practices and observations of fish migrating up the fishway. Most respondents spent between 10 and 25 h per week fishing and caught from 0.5 to 12 kg per day (average 3 kg), highlighting the part-time and opportunistic nature of seasonal floodplain fishing. Complementary gender roles in exploiting the resource were evident with women catching a wider range of species than men and fishing closer to villages. Respondents said fisheries had declined due to habitat destruction, irrigation development, population increase and illegal fishing methods. Most people wanted stronger regulation and patrolling of fish conservation zones. Several households reported catching fish species not seen in the wetland for many years post-fishway including two endangered species and one vulnerable species. Greater attention to regular enforcement of fisheries rules and gendered perspectives would assist local communities in protecting their floodplains for future generations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in the Loess Plateau Region of China are highly vulnerable to climate change. Effective adaptation governance requires in-depth, situated understanding of how adaptation is embedded in particular environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional contexts. Drawing on 93 qualitative interviews with smallholder households in five counties across three provinces on the Loess Plateau, we use a multi-scalar pathways approach to analyze two particular adaptations (planting maize and adopting drip irrigation). Our results show (1) how historical and ongoing multi-scalar, social–ecological processes interact to shape smallholder adaptation decision-making, leading to synergies, tensions, and contradictions across risk management domains and social institutions; (2) whether an adaptation strategy persists over time is in part determined by the extent to which the strategy allows smallholder households to manage various forms of risk and uncertainty in both the present and future; and (3) how past and ongoing multi-scalar adaptation pathways determine not only smallholder exposure to current stressors but also possible choices for future adaptation. Specifically, we find some smallholder adaptive strategies, such as planting maize, stabilize over time because they enable smallholders to manage market risk, climatic risk, and water pollution challenges, allow them to take advantage of opportunities to diversify their livelihoods through local wage work and labor migration, and, at the same time, fit the local social institutions that guide their agricultural management decisions. We also find some adaptive strategies promoted by non-local actors, such as drip irrigation, are abandoned because they create tensions with the ways smallholders construct their livelihoods to manage various forms of uncertainty and risk, and contradict the local social relations and cultural values embedded in their day-to-day lives. Together, these results provide insight into why particular smallholder adaptation pathways become stabilized and reproduced over time, and the cross-scalar environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional processes that underpin them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Historically, water resource policy in the Murray–Darling Basin (Basin) has taken a pro-farmer orientation leaving the environment to become the residual claimant. Around 1990, the attention was focused on minimisingoveruse that led to on-farm productivity losses and developing a market for water to help define opportunity costs of water in irrigation. More recently, the scope has been extended to include explicit allocations for the environment. However, the failure to agree on policies for recovering water for the environment in the implementation of the Basin Plan has extended avenues for rent seeking and cost shifting, thereby raising the total costs of reform. A focus on water use per se, rather than system productivity, and sidelining of market-based approaches in preference for government investment in water recovery and water use efficiency has complicated risk assignment amongst different users. Recurring droughts and resultant scarcity of water has made negotiations further complicated and controversial, broadening the gulf between environmentalists seeking public good outcomes and irrigators seeking private profit. Despite these, the MDB system as a whole, including dryland and irrigated farming, environmental uses and other industries, has adjusted to chanding conditions, drawing on new knowledge and technology and emerging market opportunities. Irrigators have shown an ability to diversify into new commodities with better prospects for managing risks. However, declining farm numbers, a changing demography and accelerating climate change point to general failure risks if the reform process were to halt and governments disregarded the gains through a rebalancing of consumption possibilities from the full complement of Basin's resources — not just irrigation. This paper, examines the sources of social costs in water resource allocation, including pros and cons of water trading with respect to agricultural production and externalities. The aim is to canvass possible reform alternatives which might help governments to become a catalyst in fostering collaboration for efficient adaptation. © 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland},

	abstract = {Increased climate variability during the last four decades has made the agricultural environment in many developing countries more uncertain, resulting in increasing exposure to risk when producing crops. In this study, we use recent farm-level data from Ghana to examine the drivers of individual and joint adoption of crop choice and soil and water conservation practices, and how adoption of these practices impacts on farm performance (crop revenue) and exposure to risks (skewness of crop yield). We employ a multinomial endogenous switching regression model to account for selectivity bias due to both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results reveal that farmers’ adoption of crop choice and soil and water conservation leads to higher crop revenues and reduced riskiness in crop production, with the largest impact on crop revenues coming from joint adoption. The findings also show that education of the household head, access to extension and weather information influence the likelihood of adopting these practices. Thus, enhancing extension services and access to climate information and irrigation can reduce gaps in adoption of soil and water conservation and crop choice, considered as climate-smart practices that will eventually improve crop revenues and reduce farmers’ exposure to climate-related production risks. © 2019 The Authors.

This point appears to have been ignored by previous studies. Based on these new empirical results, the paper suggests that government should continue to provide climate information and various types of supports to improve farmers’ adaptation abilities and help to reduce the levels of factor input by, for example, substituting organic for chemical fertiliser inputs.

This practice copes with two of the most limiting factors that are affecting sustainable development in rural areas: the lack of sanitation services and water shortages. This paper proposes a multi-criteria methodological approach to evaluate wastewater reuse potential for irrigation in rural areas and to select the most sustainable and context-aware wastewater treatment technology. In order to validate the procedure, an empirical application for the Coquimbo region (Chile) was developed. The water balance conducted illustrated that the potential wastewater source can only partially substitute for the water canonical sources. According to local citizen preferences, among the three evaluated, the most sustainable wastewater treatment technology option consists of septic tank and constructed wetland. This study provides evidence for the relevance of integrating social and environmental criteria, in addition to technical and economic ones, for supporting decision-making processes related to wastewater reuse.

By comparing this threshold with the level of seedling failure expected for an afforestation in the absence of irrigation, the planner can make an informed decision between both alternatives. The model has been applied to thirteen practical cases covering a wide range of plantations with different density, purpose and average annual net income. Based on the results obtained, a k-means clustering is carried out to identify five groups according to their suitability for irrigation. The sensitivity of the model's input variables in respect to the threshold of seedling failure is also analized. Irrigation is profitable when the expected level of seedling failure is high and/or the value of the threshold decision is low. The latter is usually the case at afforestations that require a low acceptable level of seedling failure and/or in productive plantation forestry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We consider the connection between water marketing and the modification of property rights to water in Australia, highlighting the Australian's distinctiveness through a contrast with water rights in the western US (especially California). Australia started out the same as California, but in the 1880s it abandoned California's system and adopted a new approach, ending the common law property right to water and creating a statutory right that could be modified by administrative fiat. This shifted the arena for dispute resolution from courts to parliaments. It eliminated the seniority inherent in appropriative water rights and it sidelined issues of third-party impacts. Another difference was the tight control of irrigation institutions by state governments and the national government's willingness to intervene in state and local water management. Australian water reform was wrapped in politics. When there were successes, this is because the politics were managed adroitly; when political challenges proved insurmountable, reform stalled. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {China's agricultural sector experienced rapid growth in the last two decades, with a tripled increase in sectorally total economic output from 2000 to 2017. However, expanding large-scale production also leads to substantial consumption of water resources. Using the panel data of China's 31 provinces from 2000 to 2015, this study adopts the stochastic frontiers analysis model to measure the country's agricultural water use efficiency (AWUE). We also develop a spatial econometric model to identify the main factors that influence AWUE. The results show that the AWUE of each province ascended during the observation period, presenting obvious spatial correlations and unbalanced development at the provincial level. The per capita disposable income of rural households and the proportion of high school or above education are key influencing factors of AWUE. Additionally, factors such as the total sown area of crops, the total storage capacity of reservoirs, and the number of water-saving machines, electric and diesel motors also exert certain influences. Therefore, improving the rural residents’ income and the educational level of practitioners, promoting the scale of arable land, providing training for water-saving technology, and deploying water-efficient irrigation equipment can contribute to the sustainable agriculture of China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Pakistan and India are the two major producers of the cotton, the most demanding crop of the world which is known as white gold. However, for some recent years, it deems that Pakistan’s share in the international textile market dwindles compared to India. Thereby, the study will investigate whether the productivity of the crop per hectare is the reason or area of the crop, in the countries which lead to a higher share of India in the international market. In addition, which country has a comparative advantage in terms of cotton yield kg per hectare, particularly due to technological advancement in India and Pakistan’s agriculture sector? And this study also examines which country has exploited natural and technological inputs most. The time-series data from 1954 to 2017 have been used in this study, the results of the study are drawn using two-stage analysis. At first, we get total factor productivity (TFPCc) for both the countries using Tornqvist–Theil Index: total factor productivity input–output method. Then, the obtained variable has been employed as a regress and variable on farm and non-farm regressors. The ARDL: autoregressive distribution lag regression model has been applied on [area of cotton, fertilizer consumption kg/ha, high yield varieties (HYV) seeds, electricity consumption in agriculture sector, agriculture labor force, and irrigation by canal water and tube well water, besides tractors] to find the technological advancement impact on the TFPC of cotton. The results explore that overall improvement in farm inputs has a more stable impact on the productivity of cotton in Pakistan, whereas HYV seeds, mechanization, and area are the real reason for the growth in India. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Agricultural development is an important contributor to habitat and biodiversity loss in the United States. The ESA attempts to limit this loss by prohibiting habitat destruction on private lands, but this practice is controversial because it places much of the burden for conservation on farmers. I measure the effect of these restrictions on agriculture using a hedonic analysis of county-level agricultural land values, profits, and revenues reported in the last four rounds of the agricultural census. Results provide strong evidence that ESA regulations depress these three economic measures in dryland areas, which includes counties with less than 1% of agricultural land in irrigation. Specifically, I find that farmland value and profit decline 4% after listing on average at the county level in dryland areas with protected habitat. There is no evidence that values are affected in irrigated counties. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association},

In fact, irrigation covers less than 30% of land recorded as irrigated. Due to the special conditions of mass privatization of agricultural land in the 1990s, a significant part of it has turned out to be abandoned: according to various estimates, its area is from 30 to 50 mln ha.

	abstract = {Climate change has adversely affected the livelihoods of people in Ethiopia since a large proportion of the population is heavily dependent on agriculture as their adaptive capacities are perceived to be below. Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of farmer adaptation strategies with their costs and benefits of each adaptation strategy. The data were collected from 155 farm households using a random sampling method through semistructured questionnaires. The result of the multivariate probit model revealed that the likelihood of farmers to adopt adjustment of planting date, changing crop varieties, intercropping, crop rotation, irrigation, and minimum tillage were 51.6%, 61.9%, 56.1%, 38.1%, 10.3%, and 27.1%, respectively. The joint likelihood of using all adaptation strategies was 4.2%, while their failure to adopt all the adaptation strategies was 9.8%. Among the given adaptation options, intercropping, adjusting planting dates, crop rotation, and changing crop varieties are economically viable climate adaptation strategies. Regarding the intensity of adaptation, 78% of sampled respondents were used more than one adaptation option, and their NPV and BCR were higher when they used at least one adaptation option. Farmers who did not adopt any adaptation options were able to receive the lowest income per unit production. The study recommends that households should use multiple combinations of adaptation practices rather than the use of a single adaptation option. Thus, the government and stakeholders must provide educational and extension service, training, and updated climate information to smallholder crop producers to use and select the best and combination of adaptation strategies. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Since 1960, all 50 states in the US have adopted some form of preferential tax treatment for farmland. These provisions often take the form of use-value assessment, where farmland is taxed on the basis of its value in agricultural production, as opposed to its full market value. While the main goal of use-value assessment is to slow the conversion of farmland to non-agricultural uses, other channels of influence are also possible, such as those stemming from reinvestment of foregone tax expenses. Despite its widespread nature, there is little empirical evidence pertaining to the influence of use-value assessment on land-use or investment decisions. Using a postmatching difference-in-differences framework, we exploit the temporal and spatial discontinuities surrounding the adoption of use-value assessment in Kansas in 1989 to measure how use-value assessment affected plot-level land development and irrigation investment decisions. The results of our analysis indicate that, as intended, the use-value assessment policy curtailed development in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Evidence regarding the potential investment-spurring effects of use-value assessment is more mixed, suggesting that farmers may have increased irrigation in some areas because of use-value assessment-induced tax savings. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association},

This paper aims to provide an empirical assessment of irrigation governance in 37 small-scale irrigation schemes in northern Ghana, derived from the perceptions of their users. We first distinguish six dimensions of governance based on the available literature to include participation, accountability, conflict management, transparency and cooperation, equity and fairness, and sustainable use. Next, we measure these irrigation governance dimensions using ratings provided by local water users. We then examine the relationship between these governance measures and some objective factors that possibly drive the assessments of users. The results indicate an overall good governance in the sampled schemes. Relatively, sustainable use had the lowest score and conflict management had the highest score. We further find that in schemes located in areas with relatively high annual precipitations, users report better irrigation governance. Within schemes, both users with plots at the head end and users with plots at the tail end are more critical about irrigation governance than other users. Remarkably, the number of users of a scheme has no significant effect on their overall assessment of its governance, although users in larger schemes are more positive on opportunities to participate in governance bodies and to keep these bodies accountable. To improve their sustainability, small-scale irrigation schemes (dams) may be better maintained for domestic and livestock watering. Promoting water-conserving irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation and ground water techniques is essential. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Seasonal migration is a common livelihood strategy among marginal and landless people of the western part of West Bengal. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and Census data have failed to provide information on seasonal migration and livelihoods at the micro-level. The present study focuses on the nature, characteristics and factors of seasonal migration with its importance as a livelihood strategy among women agricultural labourers (WALs) in Soul Ponamara mouza of Hirbandh block at the micro-level. The study is based on primary data collection using a purposive sampling method and a semi-structured questionnaire, personal interview and focus group discussion. This study reveals that seasonal migration from Soul Ponamara to the adjacent agriculturally prosperous districts viz. Purba Bardhaman and Hooghly (4 to 6 times in a year) is a common livelihood strategy among WALs in the study area, and its proportion is almost equal to when compared to male migrants. The small size of agricultural land holding, existing monoculture system, lack of irrigation facilities, a limited job opportunity in the Soul Ponamara mouza and its surrounding area (Amjhuri, Bijardihi, Chaka Doba, Moshiara, Bamni and Rangametia) provoke women labourers to move out in searching of works. In contrast, high wage and massive demand for skilled and semi-skilled agricultural labourers during sowing and harvesting season in the destination area, that is, paddy and potato fields of Purba Bardhaman and Hooghly districts acted as a magnet to absorb these immigrants into the workforce. This study concludes that seasonal migration opted for employment and income generation is the primary livelihood strategy adopted by the rural WALs of this mouza to cope up with the existing poverty and food insecurity. © 2020 Nandi & Sarkar.

	abstract = {It is well accepted that biological innovations, particularly varietal improvements, have greatly contributed to agricultural yield and output growth in the past. At the same time, public funding for breeding programmes such as at the Agricultural Research Council in South Africa has dwindled. In an effort to confirm the importance of continued funding of varietal improvement programmes, this paper estimates the benefits from wheat varietal innovations and attributes them to the different institutional sources (public, private and others) that have contributed to varietal changes in South Africa. The empirical analyses used data on market shares of wheat varieties planted by farmers and annual quantities of wheat produced across different wheat-production areas in South Africa (summer dryland, dryland winter, and irrigation). A vintage regression model was estimated to calculate the proportional yield gain from wheat varietal improvements. The results indicated that the rate of gain in yield as a result of releases of new wheat varieties (variety research) was 0.8 per cent per year (equivalent to 19.84 kg/ha/year) for dryland summer varieties, and 0.5 per cent for both irrigation (equivalent to 32.20 kg/ha/year) and dryland winter varieties (equivalent to 16.65 kg/ha/year). The attribution of benefits among different institutional sources confirms that not accounting for attribution of benefits by source and time period results is overestimation of benefits to any specific research programme. Attribution of benefits by institutional source showed that Sensako dominated, while the share of the ARC-SGI substantially declined, after deregulation of the wheat sub-sector. The results highlight the impact of the decline in public funding for wheat variety improvement research after deregulation and provide a strong argument for continued public funding for variety improvement in South Africa. © 2018, © 2018 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {Irrigation is a socio-technical infrastructure for food and water security programs of many developing countries, including the Philippines. Consequently, the government has been heavily investing in irrigation development to boost crop yield and to enlarge currently irrigated areas for many years now. However, the Philippine climate has been changing; and the climatic variations and change present potential threats to the resilience of the Philippine irrigation systems. The impacts of climate variability and change on the resiliency of irrigation infrastructures challenge the sustainability of the government’s investments in food security programs. Climate change would alter the Philippine water cycle thus changing the temporal and geographical patterns of rainfall, evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater recharge. Extreme hydro-meteorological events have been occurring more frequently in the country today—strong typhoons with undocumented wind speed and with rainfall of unrecorded amount and intensity are being experienced more often now than before. These extreme events bring about risks to irrigated agriculture because of the uncertainty of either too much or too little water, or both. The aforementioned risks will infringe upon the planning, design, and construction processes of new irrigation systems, and upon the operation and maintenance of existing ones. The study applied systems dynamics approach to review and analyze factors that strengthen or weaken the resiliency of the Philippine irrigation systems to the impacts of climate variability and change. The intrinsic system resilience to stresses and episodic shocks of climate variability and change emerge from the interrelationship and feedback interaction between the elements and irrigation processes in an irrigation system. The current internal dynamics in most irrigation systems exposes its incapacity to serve fully its designed area. As a result, the overoptimistic technical and economic assumptions used in the planning and design phase imperiled the intrinsic resilience of existing irrigation systems to climate variability and change. Moreover, the degradation of physical infrastructures attributable to low maintenance level and inadequate rehabilitation works result in continuing inability of irrigation systems to serve the designed area with adequate water and weaken their intrinsic resilience. The social components of the system--the irrigation agency, and the farmer community in particular, are undertaking varied adaptation actions to increase and strengthen both the system’s “soft” and “hard” resiliency. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

	abstract = {Using prices to improve the efficiency with which water resources are allocated is now widely accepted in principle if somewhat difficult to achieve in practice. Whilst there are some technical difficulties associated with full-cost recovery in irrigation, the lack of political will to tackle reform remains a significant impediment. This article reports the results of an empirical investigation into farmers’ preferences for changes to water prices and tariff structures. We conclude that some of the preferences of farmers are conducive to price reform. We also find evidence that public subsidy of infrastructure in irrigation is not always aligned with the preferences of farmers. © 2017 The Authors.

The restriction imposed a uniform quota on water use with a 5-year allocation and allowed trading of the quota within the restricted area. Our analysis exploits unique micro-level data on irrigated water use, irrigated acreage, and crops. We use a difference-in-differences econometric strategy that also includes farmer-time fixed effects to estimate the response to the restriction, where we exploit water rights between 2 and 5 miles of the policy boundary as a control group. Results indicate that farmers reduced water use by 26% due to the policy with most of the response due to reductions in water use intensity on the same crops rather than through reductions in irrigated acreage or changes in crops. The results imply that the short-run welfare impact of the policy was smaller than a policy that reduces irrigated acreage. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the status of the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation, and discuss how it is affected by climate change and tubewell density in rural China. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a nine-province village survey and secondary climate data. A Tobit model (or censored regression model) was used to estimate the determinants of supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. Findings: Results show that the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation was 89 percent on average in the past three years. The non-linear relationship in the econometric results revealed that the 30-year annual temperature significantly influenced the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. When the temperature rises above the turning point (6.30°C), it shifts from a positive to a negative relationship with the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. The 30-year annual temperature in eight of the nine provinces (i.e. except for Jilin Province) was higher than the turning point. If the temperature increases by 20°C in the future, other factors being constant, the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation will decline by 20 percent. However, if precipitation increases by 10 percent, the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation could improve by 3 percent, while reducing precipitation by 10 percent will lower the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation by 3 percent. Increasing the density of tubewells considerably improves the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. However, although increasing the density of tubewells may yield enough groundwater for irrigation, this one-sided approach raises sustainability concerns. Research limitations/implications: Although increasing the density of tubewells may ensure that enough groundwater is available for irrigation, such a conclusion is one sided, and sustainability concerns should be raised in assessing this method of creating supply reliability. Originality/value: This paper improves the understanding of the impact of climate variables on agriculture irrigation and water supply reliability in the micro scale, and provides a scientific basis for relevant policy making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {How natural resources are measured and bounded within a property right system can influence their development and productivity. This is especially true for surface water given its fluid, fungible, and stochastic nature. Two quantifications have emerged: The prior appropriation doctrine provides absolute quantities to water allocated based on first use while proportional water rights distribute a set percentage of total water to owners. While theoretical differences have been identified, empirical tests are scarce due to the endogenous choice of water rights. I identify and utilize a natural experiment where acequias (Hispanic-rooted irrigation ditches) developed in Territorial New Mexico are later divided by the formation of Colorado, exogenously compelling that subset to be subject to the priority system while those in New Mexico continue to practice proportional division. Drawing on a broad compilation of archival, administrative, satellite, hydrological, and survey data, I find priority rights curtail investment for later irrigators, but that the marginal product of water is generally lower under that right system. This research advances our understanding of how distinct property right systems affect resource development and use. The results can guide stakeholders devising or reforming rights to a resource, particularly ones with stochastic flows. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we show that irrigation districts alleviate that risk by deviating from the strict application of prior appropriation doctrine. As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water-intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007–14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought-sensitive, high-value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes. As a result of differences in planting decisions, members of irrigation districts earn on average $16.20 per acre, or 6.0% more per year than those outside of irrigation districts. © 2018 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to appraise surface water quality for irrigation purposes. This research work concerns seven dams’ water from higher and lower part of Cheliff agricultural area located in northeast to the larger catchment Cheliff-Zahrez, central Algeria. The following dams are investigated, namely Deurdeur, Ghrib, Harreza, Oued Fodda, Oued Mellouk, Sidi M’hamed Ben Taïba and Sidi Yakoub. Irrigation water quality evaluation was carried out by measuring and calculating physicochemical quality parameters monthly during three years: 2014, 2015 and 2016. For assessing the groundwater for irrigation suitability, parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, sodium adsorption ratio, pHc, adjusted sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, Kelly’s ratio, USSL, Wilcox’s diagram and permeability index suggest that the groundwater of the study area is moderately suitable for irrigation purposes. Based on USSL and Wilcox’s diagram, it falls under excellent to unsuitable category indicating low salinity and high sodium water, which can be used for irrigation in almost all types of soil with little danger of exchangeable sodium. The Pearson correlation coefficient rate revealed strong correlation between several parameters. The water of Sidi M’hamed Ben Taïba dam has the best appropriateness for irrigation purpose compared to the other dams. Its water may be used in irrigation without limitation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {In arid areas, irrigation water is an essential input into agricultural production. However, rainfall and, correspondingly, surface water supplies are often highly variable, creating uncertainty over the value of long-term, water-dependent investments in these cropping systems. Moreover, climate change is expected to increase both crop water requirements and the variability of seasonal rainfall, meaning the constraints imposed by variable water supplies are likely to grow in cost as climate change progresses. In this setting, storing water in wet years for use in dry years is valuable. In particular, it would be expected to increase the value of perennial crops, which require large up-front investments that pay off gradually over the life of the tree. We first show, in a simple theoretical model, that given the timing of returns to investments in perennial crops, there is always some level of drought risk above which annual crops will be preferred to perennials. We then demonstrate this effect empirically using a unique institutional setting in which access to a relatively new form of water storage, groundwater banking, effectively created spatial variation in drought risk between irrigation districts in Kern County, California. Using a 22-year dataset of individual cropping decisions, we provide evidence that access to a large groundwater banking project, the Kern Water Bank, increased the rate at which farmers switched from lower value annual crops such as wheat and alfalfa into high-value perennial nut crops, primarily almonds and pistachio. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association},

	abstract = {Purpose: Agriculture is under pressure to produce more food under increasingly variable climate conditions. Consequently, producers need management innovations that lead to improved physical and financial productivity. Currently, farm accounting technologies lack the sophistication to allow producers to analyse productivity of water. Furthermore water-related agricultural technology (“agtech”) systems do not readily link to accounting innovations. This study aims to establish a conceptual and practical framework for linking temporal, biophysical and management decision-making to accounting by develop a soil moisture and climate monitoring tool. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an exploratory mixed-methods approach to understand supply of and demand for water accounting and water-related agtech; and bundling these innovations with farm accounting to generate a stable tool with the ability to improve agricultural practices over time. Three phases of data collection are the focus here: first, a desk-based review of water accounting and water technology – including benchmarking of key design characteristics of these methods and key actor interviews to verify and identify trends, allowing for conceptual model development; second, a producer survey to test demand for the “bundled” conceptual model; third and finally, a participant-based case study in potato-farming that links the data from direct monitoring and remote sensing to farm accounts. Findings: Design characteristics of water accounting and agtech innovations are bundled into an overall irrigation decision-making conceptual model based on in-depth review of available innovations and verification by key actors. Producer surveys suggest enough demand to pursue practical bundling of these innovations undertaken by developing an integrated accounting, soil moisture and climate monitoring tool on-farm. Productivity trends over two seasons of case study data demonstrate the pivotal role of accounting in leading to better technical irrigation decisions and improving water productivity. Originality/value: The model can assist practitioners to gauge strengths and weaknesses of contemporary water accounting fads and fashions and potential for innovation bundling for improved water productivity. The practical tool demonstrates how on-farm irrigation decision-making can be supported by linking farm accounting systems and smart technology © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The government has been trying to increase the pulses production with increase area and enhanced yield through various schemes namely NFSM-Pulse. Bringing more pulse area under irrigation, adoption of recommended production technology is expected to increase the yield that might help in bridging the demand supply gap. As blackgram was found to be surplus, the people of Assam should gradually replace lentil with blackgram as dal.

	abstract = {Despite the signs of distress and fatigue in Indian agriculture, the use of machines in crop operations has increased manifold in recent times. Proponents of mechanization argue that mechanization saves time and cost, and improves agricultural productivity. The Government of India has also encouraged mechanization through subsiding farm machinery and establishing custom hiring centres. Earlier studies have found significant regional variation in the spread of agricultural mechanization. Cost of cultivation data collected by Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) reveal that although the share of machine labour in the cost of cultivation per hectare has increased, there exist significant differences across crops in the use of mechanical input. Empirical studies in different regions have found a significant presence of the rental market for services of agricultural machinery. However, in recent years there have been very few studies on the patterns of mechanization based on household-level data on ownership and investment in agricultural machinery and implements. Agro-ecological characteristics of a region are said to have a significant impact on the level of mechanization. Ownership of machinery is also significantly influenced by the factors such as size of landholding, access to irrigation and access to institutional credit. The pattern of investment and ownership of machinery has important implications on the profitability of farming. This article uses unit-level data from the All-India Debt and Investment Survey (NSS 70th round 2013) to study the pattern of agricultural mechanization in India based on the ownership of agricultural machinery and implements. Using ownership and expenditure data it studies the questions of recent patterns in agricultural mechanization across agro-ecological regions and land classes. © 2020 Association of Asia Scholars.},

	abstract = {We analyze the impact of restricting outdoor irrigation using monthly data from 408 urban water suppliers in California during the final years of the 2012-2017 drought. Our estimates suggest that assigning an additional no-irrigation day per week leads to a decrease in average monthly residential water consumption by approximately 0.8 gallons per capita-day. There is substantial heterogeneity in this impact. First, the marginal effect of a stricter irrigation policy varies depending on the existing level of outdoor watering restrictions-while initial restrictions lead to considerable conservation gains, tightening these measures further does not bring additional gains unless 6 weekly no-irrigation days are implemented. Furthermore, the policy is more effective in areas where residential water use represents a larger share of total urban water consumption and areas which perform better at reaching the 25% state conservation target. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {During the last decades, several regions of the world have experienced an increasingly forceful penetration by commercial service companies into irrigation water management, altering the institutional structures and procedures of common-pool resources management. In many cases, private-sector penetration takes place when water user organizations require a company to implement high-tech water control such as pressurized irrigation systems, as part of ‘modernization policies’. This study focuses on four representative cases of these processes with differing degrees of private-enterprise penetration in the Valencia Region (Spain). The research analyzes the strategies of collective-private confrontation and collaboration that are emerging in irrigator communities, and characterize how they affect the management of these irrigation systems. Results show how private enterprise intrusion has unequally affected the interactions between the different components of these irrigation systems. This has created different hybrids between private and common pool-resources management institutions, as well as different autonomies, dependencies and socio-political subjects. Users’ capacity to guide this coproduction process and maintain local control over their irrigation systems is essential to ensure the stability and preserve the robustness of each irrigation system. The quality of human capital and the recognition of collective water management values makes irrigation entities more robust vis-à-vis external pressures and disturbances, which in some of the cases analyzed have generated major social conflicts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to understand the significant farm and market-level factors that incentivize the adoption and marketing of pulses influencing its supply response to changing demand. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first use a modified Nerlovian supply response model using secondary data to identify the major price and non-price factors influencing the supply of pigeon pea, black and green gram in the major pulses growing states in India. Second, using primary qualitative data the authors map the pulses value chain from farm to retail to identify the how proportional and fixed transaction costs (FCTs) influence market participation of pulses growers and limit the transmission of price and quality information. Findings: The supply response model shows some positive influence of price on area allocation for pigeon pea and black gram and some negative effects of yield and price increase of competing crops on pigeon pea acreage. However, for the most part, the area of Kharif pulses is inelastic to prices in the long run. Irrigation, rainfall and yields in the lag year are shown to have a significant influence on area allocation for pulses. The market study reveals that low yields, low landholding size and geographical disadvantages of high agro-climatic risk and poor connectivity hinder market access of pulses farmers relative to other crops. Market power in favor of buyers and poor price and quality information is a disadvantage to sellers, influencing their ability to participate in markets. Research limitations/implications: A quantitative study would be required to identify the magnitude of farm and market-level transaction costs. Originality/value: This study helps to understand the supply response of pulses and gives suggestions to direct policy to rectify this. © 2021, Mathew Abraham and Prabhu Pingali.},

	abstract = {Recent panel estimates of weather effects on crop yields have been central for discussing future food security under climate change, but these estimates only carry limited behavioral response. Growers can adjust harvest decisions when experiencing weather shocks. Using US county-level data on corn and soybeans, I show that harvested ratios, measured by harvested over planted acres, respond to temperature nonlinearly, and they are substantially decreased when temperature exceeds 35°C. Corn harvested ratios are more positively affected by moderate heat and less negatively affected by extreme heat, reflecting growers’ behavioral response incentivized by the higher revenue of corn. Under a 1.5°C warming, neglecting harvested ratio responses can overestimate production loss by more than 10% for corn but underestimates that by more than 15% for soybeans. Evidence of response heterogeneity suggests that market condition and crop insurance further complicate the induced harvest adjustments, and adaptation exists through within-season crop substitution and irrigation. © 2020 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

	abstract = {Volumetric irrigation water pricing, to replace area-based pricing, was experimentally introduced in two surface irrigation systems in Northern Luzon, Philippines. A survey was conducted in 2012 (baseline) and in 2013 (after the treatment). This paper draws lessons from this pilot project for future studies. We find that the impacts are not against the expected benefit of volumetric pricing: reduced discharge (water saving), more water for lower stream (equitable water distribution), and stricter water management. At the same time, we realized the tremendous difficulty in accurate volume measurement in surface irrigation systems. Given the difficulty, a volumetric system design may be feasible to measure volume at the headgate of a primal-level canal with a firm measurement structure and charge the fee to the group of farmers in the canal. This approach, however, demands for the successful collective management among the large group of farmers. An alternative design may be to charge water fee to a much smaller unit (e.g., water users group) for their easier collective management. However, this requires investment in infrastructure for group-level volume measurement and water control. An appropriate system in the reality seems to lie in the spectrum of these two options, depending on different environmental and socio-economic background. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

In this study, material flow analysis (MFA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA), were combined. The MFA was used to examine the interdependence of the three natural resources, and the LCA was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the WEF system. The WEF nexus analysis shows that tap water supply, oil refining, the cogeneration of steam and electricity, thermoelectric power plants, irrigation, animal husbandry, and aquaculture are the main interwoven nodes and have the most prominent impact on the three natural resources. When the unit products from the WEF system were determined, LCA was implemented for these products to identify 15 types of environmental impacts. The environmental impacts for the WEF system were then calculated based on the use of unit products. The results of LCA showed that the most prominent impacts are the impact of public electricity on climate change; oil products on ozone depletion and ionizing radiation; tap water on metal depletion; and animal husbandry on terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the assessment of the alternative resource management strategies, if both water and energy policies are modified simultaneously, the impact of the overall WEF system on most environmental impact categories could be reduced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

We use the PROMETHEE II outranking method to analyse data from a survey in which farmers and experts were asked to evaluate adaptation options based on potentially conflicting criteria. Adaptation options for soil and land management, such as crop rotation and composting, score high based on two sets of criteria for assessing adaptation options for agriculture. River diversion, preventing leaching and erosion, and drip irrigation are ranked highest as adaptation options for water management. Regarding natural resource management, the highest ranked adaptation options are afforestation, water retention and maximizing crop yield. Rankings by farmers and by experts are weakly correlated for agriculture and water management, and negatively correlated for natural resource management, which shows the importance of extension services and of involving farmers in the decision-making process to ensure the feasibility of adaptation options. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The Melamchi area is in the northeastern part of Kathmandu from where the Melamchi River is considered as a major source of drinking water for the people of Kathmandu city. This paper examines the characteristics of natural springs in terms of their distribution, discharge, water utilization and conservation in the context of climate change. Out of the total surveyed springs of the Melamchi area, 93% are permanent and two-thirds of the total springs are located in mid-elevation (1500–2500 m). One-fourth of the total springs are small in terms of discharge and are used for multiple purposes such as drinking, livestock, irrigation and household cleaning. Around 45% of the springs provide a source of drinking water for up to five households. Our work has shown that the water volume in about 30% of the springs has decreased over the last decade. The springs located in mid-elevation with discharge less than 5 liters per minute are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities. The 2015 Nepal earthquake had a huge and immediate impact on the water volume of the springs in our study with an immediate drying effect in about 18% of the springs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

One way to address agriculture's impact during droughts is to use recycled water for irrigation, but little is known about how consumers will respond to information disclosing that a food product was produced with recycled water. On the positive side, irrigation with recycled water is environmentally friendly. On the negative side, there is an “ick” factor that might repel consumers. We conducted a framed field experiment to evaluate consumers’ responses to California and French wines made from grapes produced with recycled, conventional, and an unspecified type of water for irrigation. We find that consumers prefer not to know; their willingness to pay is greatest when the wine is made from grapes irrigated with an unspecified type of water. There is a discount for conventional irrigation water for both California and French wines, but it is statistically significant only for the California wines. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

I estimate interquantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 °C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

We also show how these negative impacts could be aggravated in the future by the likely increased number of intense droughts threatened by global climate change.

First, I use a fixed effects model with matched samples of farmers to determine the effect of the program on the water use of individuals who retire acreage. I find that every acre authorized for irrigation that is retired in the program represents about 1.28 acre-feet of water that would have been used each year. Further, I do not find evidence that farmers increase their water use in an effort to satisfy program eligibility requirements. Second, I estimate a probit regression to determine which factors most influence the probability that a farmer retires a water right. Using the results of the probit regression, I then simulate enrollment decisions outside of the policy region to assess how features of the program impact its cost effectiveness and how the policy design could be improved. I find that programs that base incentives on past levels of water extraction lead to more water use reductions per dollar paid. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association},

We analyse the properties of this background risk and study how initial water allocations impact farmers' land allocation decisions between an irrigated crop and a non-irrigated crop, both characterised by random expected net returns. We then extend the model by permitting irrigation water to be traded ex-Ante at a known price (forward market). Finally, we illustrate our main theoretical findings using simulations.

This paper interrogates the continuing attraction of this model for irrigation, asking how and why it persists. Is the fact that engineering is so central to irrigation schemes another example of ‘high modernism’ as Scott might argue? Analysis of the history and current policy-making context of a new irrigation scheme in Malawi suggests a picture that is more complex, in which practical engineering considerations combine with narratives of modernisation and political imperatives to create momentum and lock-in. Understanding this, and why lessons from the past inadequately shape future-directed planning requires interrogation of the positionality of those involved, including state, donors and private sector actors and the political, economic and discursive fields in which they operate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The analysis develops supply functions of irrigable land from a water resource model for 282 river basins and applies them within a global economy-wide model. The analysis reveals two key findings. First, explicitly representing irrigated land has a small impact on global food, bioenergy and deforestation outcomes. This is because this modification allows irrigated and rainfed land to expand in different proportions, which counters the effect of rising marginal costs for the expansion of irrigated land. Second, changes in water availability have small impacts on global food prices, bioenergy production, land use change and the overall economy, even with large-scale (c. 150 exajoules) bioenergy production, due in part to endogenous irrigation and storage responses. However, representing water scarcity and changes in water availability can be important regionally, with relatively arid areas and/or areas with rapidly growing populations fully exhausting our estimated maximum irrigation capacity that allows for improved irrigation efficiency, lining of canals to limit water loss, and expanding storage to fully capture average annual water flows. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Plastic materials used in agriculture mostly derive from synthetic petro-chemical polymers. They require at the end of their lifetime a suitable waste management system for the collection and treatment. A research was carried out in order to define a GIS methodology for mapping the agricultural plastic waste on the land. The use in agriculture of plastics in Barletta-Andria-Trani Province – Apulia Region – was investigated by applying orthophotos analysis and remote sensing survey. Besides purposed Plastic Waste Indexes were created to release land use to waste generation. The data were organized in a specific geo-database. The analysis showed that the agricultural plastic waste yearly produced from covering films was 627 kg ha−1, from the anti-hail nets was 159 kg ha−1, from nets for crop protection was 192 kg ha−1, from shading nets was 131 kg ha−1, from irrigation pipes was 104 kg ha−1. Through GIS, the areas with high density of plastic wastes were pointed out and the suitable location of collection centres was defined. The produced maps and the GIS database can be always updatable tools, useful for monitoring and optimizing the collection of agricultural plastic waste from the farms and their transport to the recycling companies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This research developed an analysis tool on nexus resource efficiency and management towards bioeconomy. Its application has been demonstrated in the Thai cassava and sugarcane supply chains combining Material Flow Analysis, nexus assessment, and Eco-efficiency. The results revealed that doubling the feedstock and maximizing biochemical/biomaterial production has the highest value addition and also the highest eco-efficiency among all the options considered. However, it required at least 2-3 times the amount of water and energy for irrigation and processing as compared to the base case. A more detailed analysis of regional resource availability and security needs to be further conducted to support the decision-making process. The scenario that has no increase in feedstock production but allocates the cassava used for export as feed to use for feedstock for biochemical/biomaterial instead can also have excellent economic returns and eco-efficiency with much lower resource consumption. Feedstock cultivation yield and lactic acid production efficiency are critical factors in reducing overall supply chain resource consumption. Decision-makers need to prepare a strategic plan for optimum resource allocation towards maintaining a less resource-intensive society. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent studies suggest extensive use of environmental resources in agrofarming degrades ecosystem significantly. In this backdrop, this study aims at assessing ecoefficiency of paddy farming. Because ecoefficiency links up between economic performances and environmental resources supporting the provision of goods and services for the society, this study further investigates the effectiveness of attending Farmers' Field School (FFS), an agroenvironmental program, in conserving environmental resources through improving farm-level ecoefficiency. Design/methodology/approach: In a dataset of 200 randomly selected paddy farmers from three districts of the southwestern Bangladesh, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to compute both radial and pressure-specific (nutrient balance, energy balance, irrigation and pesticide lethal risk) ecoefficiency scores. Furthermore, propensity score matching (PSM) technique is applied to examine the impact of FFS program on farm-level ecoefficiency. Findings: The DEA results suggest that paddy farmers are highly eco-inefficient. The computed radial eco-efficiency score is 0.40 implying farmers could reduce around 60% of environmental pressure equiproportionally even by maintaining the same level of value addition. In addition, the PSM results suggest farmers' participation in FFS program led to around 22.5% higher radial ecoefficiency and 7–25% higher environmental pressure-specific eco-efficiencies. Furthermore, simulation exercises reveal that FFS participation in interaction with farm size would lead to around 32–40% reduction of all environmental pressures. Practical implications: Promoting FFS programs among paddy farmers could be an effective policy option to improve eco-efficiency through environment-friendly farming paradigm. Originality/value: This study is probably the maiden effort that has examined the impact of attending the FFS program on ecoefficiency improvement in Bangladesh. This study contributes to both the concern literature by adding useful information and the policymakers by providing new insights about the reduction of environmental resource usage with maintaining the same value addition from agrofarming. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Using detailed irrigation behavior data for growers in the High Plains Aquifer region of Kansas covering 1990–2014, we find clear evidence of peer influence in adoption of LEPA, net of environmental factors. Specifically, an additional neighboring LEPA installation within 1 km increases the probability of adoption by about 0.3 percentage points, on average, and this effect diminishes with distance. Our empirical estimates indicate that in the absence of peer effects, LEPA adoption would have been about 10% lower (1,000–1,600 fewer installations) per year. In addition, we find that growers install LEPA in response to higher energy prices. © 2019 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Agricultural training is a potentially effective method to diffuse relevant new technologies to increase productivity and alleviate rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers’ technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the conventional farmer training approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Managing outdoor water use while maintaining urban tree cover is a key challenge for water managers in arid climates. Urban trees generate flows of ecosystem services in arid areas, but also require significant amounts of irrigation. In this paper, a bioeconomic-health model of trees and water use is developed to investigate management of an urban forest canopy when irrigation is costly, water has economic value, and trees provide ecosystem services. The optimal tree irrigation decision is illustrated for Albuquerque, New Mexico, an arid Southwest US city. Using a range of monetary values for water, we find that the tree irrigation decision is sensitive to the value selected. Urban deforestation is optimal when the value of water is sufficiently high, or alternatively starts low, but grows to cross a specific threshold. If, however, the value of water is sufficiently low or if the value of tree cover rises over time, then deforestation is not optimal. The threshold value of water where the switch is made between zero and partial deforestation is well within previously identified ranges on actual water values. This model can be applied generally to study the tradeoffs between urban trees and water use in arid environments. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of short-term loan (STL) vs long-term loan (LTL) on wheat productivity of small farms in Sindh, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The econometric estimation is based on cross-sectional data collected in 2016 from 18 villages in three districts, i.e. Shikarpur, Sukkur and Shaheed Benazirabad, Sindh, Pakistan. The sample data set consist of 180 wheat farmers. The collected data were analyzed through different econometric techniques like Cobb–Douglas production function and Instrumental variables (two-stage least squares) approach. Findings: This study reconfirmed that agricultural credit has a positive and highly significant effect on wheat productivity, while the short-term loan has a stronger effect on wheat productivity than the long-term loan. The reasons behind the phenomenon may be the significantly higher usage of agricultural inputs like seeds of improved variety and fertilizers which can be transformed into the wheat yield in the same year. However, the LTL users have significantly higher investments in land preparation, irrigation and plant protection, which may lead to higher wheat production in the coming years. Research limitations/implications: In the present study, only those wheat farmers were considered who obtained agricultural loans from formal financial institutions like Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited and Khushhali Bank. However, in the rural areas of Sindh, Pakistan, a considerable proportion of small-scale farmers take credit from informal financial channels. Therefore future researchers should consider the informal credits as well.

	abstract = {Fluoride contamination in groundwater is a major geo-environmental issue. In India, groundwater sources contribute more than 85 per cent of the drinking water requirement in rural areas, 76 per cent of irrigation requirements and more than 50 per cent of the urban and industrial water supplies. Many studies have reported fluoride-related health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis in humans due to drinking of fluoride-rich water which has severe socio-economic implications. The permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1.5 mg/l according to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2004) and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS, 2012). Puruliya is the westernmost district of West Bengal and located on the eastern slope of the Chotanagpur plateau. The intensive and prolonged dry spell, semi-arid climate, long-term withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation, alkaline nature of sub-surface circulating water, a long residence time of water in fractured aquifers and low chances of dilution are favourable for fluoride enrichment in the Puruliya District. Eighteen out of 20 blocks of the district have high fluoride level in groundwater. This paper attempts to examine the status of fluoride concentration in groundwater, its distribution including the causative factors for its occurrence. It also tries to draw a comparative view of the change in fluoride pattern for the period 2005-06 and 2015-16 and estimate population under threat. Data collected from Physical Health & Engineering Department (PHED) is superimposed over topographical maps and Google Earth. Mapping of fluoride endemic areas in Puruliya district is attempted to delineate areas and the extent of fluoride contamination in the study area. © 2019 Mandal and Sanyal.},

Transaction costs and collective action theories are used to characterize disturbances and responses. Disturbances are characterized by looking at the uncertainty they generate, their frequency, the distance of the transacting partners they affect, and their impact on asset-specific transactions. Responses are assessed based on the collective action tasks they involve and classified into coordination and cooperation responses. A qualitative comparative analysis confirms two pathways that are sufficient for the emergence of cooperation responses. The first path is congruent with transaction costs theory, and points to disturbances that are frequent and asset specific; the second path supports relational theory, and points to disturbances that emerge progressively from within the system. Other patterns include the tendency of irrigation associations to delegate to external entities when disturbances are external and occur frequently; and the adaptation of existing institutions when the disturbances are internal and progressive. © 2017 Millennium Economics Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change in Eastern Africa increases water scarcity and raises the demand for additional water resources. To augment supply and adapt rainfall variability, most Sub-Saharan countries like Ethiopia emphasize the expansion of irrigation water supply, while paying less attention to the demand side in the management and use of water resources. Public investment on irrigation creates not only a strain on scarce public funds, but also is insufficient to utilize irrigation potential. Pricing (valuation) is a promising tool for efficient use of resources and cost recovery. Nevertheless, pricing of water (especially crop irrigation) has so far received little attention. Further, the effect of climate change on WTP for small-scale irrigation is not yet well investigated. Hence, this paper seeks to answer the applied part relating to local farmers’ WTP for improved irrigation water supply. We control rainfall variability as a proxy for climate change, in which we support its reliability using the subjective assessment of respondents. We show that farmers are more willing to pay for improved irrigation water (up to 8% of their per capita income). Further, socio-economic, marketing, and climate change variables are found significant determinants of WTP. It suggests a large scope for water pricing and sheds light on where the expected benefits of irrigation are the largest. The findings might also fill the void in the literature and would pave for further research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change is a significant obstacle for farmers in the least developed countries like Afghanistan and adaptation support is exceptionally scarce. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers’ adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers’ access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers’ self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan. © 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland},

In addition, focus group discussions and key informants interview were also used. This study employed descriptive statistics, food insecurity index and Tobit model to analyze the data. The finding of the study revealed that, in the study area, the incidence of food insecurity was 53.62%, with the depth and severity of food insecurity being 16.84% and 7.32%, respectively. The study finding also pointed out that the mean kilocalorie intake of food insecure households was 1440.37kcal/AE/day, with the minimum and maximum being 597.65 kcal and 2048.13 kcal, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated Tobit model result revealed that age of the household head, family size and off-farm and non-farm income positively affected extent of households food insecurity; whereas access to irrigation, farm income, distance to market and access to credit negatively affected the extent of households’ food insecurity. Moreover, the study also identified that reducing meal size, reducing frequency of meal served, working as a daily laborer and selling livestock’s were the top four main coping mechanisms opted against food insecurity and/or shortage. Therefore, to reverse the incidence, future interventions should focus on the aforementioned factors to build the capacity of households through enhancing their access to human, financial and physical capital. © 2019, The Author(s).},

It contributes in sedentary lifestyle of the population by providing jobs in oasis regions and by generating currencies exported from their products. But this sector encounters difficulties in its operation, mainly: the production segment marked by a low yield due to several constraints, notably the irrigation. This constraint is analyzed basing on concrete case of the performances of the date palm farms of the region of Tolga (Department of Biskra). A work was carried out through a survey of 170 farms and interviews with institutions that have relations with the subject. The study showed that the irrigation situation in these palm groves remains inefficient and that the main irrigation indicators remain far from the recommended standards; although the improvement recorded through the support programs. The situation results from a series of technical and socioeconomic constraints. The consequences are detrimental to the technical and economic performance of farms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {After recent projections for food and agricultural production for the next three decades, water is at the centre of the discussion. Given the increase in population growth, food demand will increase and the agricultural sector will likely have to expand the use of irrigation water to meet this rising demand. However, water scarcity leads to significant water management issues in the agricultural sector. With agriculture playing an important role in the water crisis as it is by far the largest user of water, the emphasis is finding ways to allocate this scarce resource more efficiently and to produce increasing quantities of food with decreasing quantities of water. The improved effectiveness of water conveyance, the efficiency in its use, and the associated impact on non-water input and output choices have the potential to impact the economic well-being of the farming community and promote the sustainability of agricultural production. The objective of this paper is to contribute toward productivity-enhancing policies by estimating the magnitude of gains from the more effective use of water in agriculture. The effectiveness of these policies depends on the proper measurement of water’s contribution to agricultural efficiency and productivity. This paper develops a measure of water’s contribution to total factor productivity (TFP) change that accounts for spatial water quantity and quality adjustments. This spatial model is a first attempt to estimate the contribution of water use to agricultural productivity and to capture differences in farm-level productivity due to head versus tail disparities in water allocation and water quality. Water policy strategies should aim toward internalizing the spatial externalities and encouraging productivity-enhancing techniques allowing the farmers to produce more output with the same or even less water and to improve the quality of water used in the agricultural sector by deploying sustainable management practice and promoting community engagement. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Maize has become a key issue for food security across the world, including China. This paper analyzes the land-use change for maize in China and its driving forces using a multilevel approach with cluster data from 13,605 farm households across 290 villages in 31 provinces from mainland China. A theoretical model for analysing land-use change for maize in China is derived from the optimisation of profit function, and the driving forces are focused on economic, irrigation, mechanisation, governance, household characteristic, land-type, and climate factors. Data analysis and model selection exhibits significant heterogeneity in terms of land-use change for maize across the villages. Based on the Area Model and the Ratio Model, the empirical results demonstrate the following. First, natural environmental conditions are crucial for land-use change for maize in China. Second, the net revenue per hectare of maize is a crucial, significantly positive driving force of land-use change for maize. Third, the wheat area positively affects the maize area due to crop rotation between maize and wheat in most major maize-producing regions. Fourth, the improvement of the mechanisation level is beneficial to land-use change for maize. Fifth, subsidies positively affect land-use change for maize. Sixth, farm-household size positively affects the maize area, and off-farm household income decreases the maize area but increases the ratio of maize to the total cereal area. Finally, climate factors differentially affect land-use change for maize across regions in China. The results suggest that it is important for policymakers to integrate various considerations with respect to differences among regions and situations when promoting land-use change for maize. © Vilnius University, 2002-2020.},

Respondents were largely food secure, however, empowerment in agriculture and food and nutrition security were moderately associated. This was partly attributed to the importance crop diversification and markets for accessing other nutrient-dense food and the status quo of purchasing food versus own food production. It was concluded that pursuing crop diversification and women market-oriented empowerment by improving farmers skills in agriculture would likely improve food and nutrition security. It was recommended that a more transformative and empowering system that allows farmers to diversify crop production and access more markets be sought.

	abstract = {Worldwide, the demand-side flexibility is subject to extensive researches to hedge against the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable power and/or reduce the peak demand of the power system. The electricity consumptions, including residential, agricultural and industrial, have responsive behavior which can provide demand flexibility to the power system when aggregated and coordinated properly. Against the literature on residential and industrial sectors, the Demand Response (DR) potentials of the agricultural sector are still a challenge for energy policy-makers. This paper aims to fill the gap conducting a research study into DR opportunities for agricultural electricity consumption. This paper first introduces the main barriers to the agricultural DR, e.g. the size of the irrigation system, flexibility of water delivery, onsite labor, and on-farm power electronic control devices. Secondly, practical solutions are proposed to eliminate barriers. Finally, in order to facilitate the integration of demand flexibilities to the power system, a novel structure is suggested for the first time as Agricultural Demand Response Aggregator (ADRA). Therefore, reviewing the main barriers of ADR programs, suggesting practical solutions to break the barriers and finally suggesting a workable structure for the ADRA are the main contributions. To sum up, this tutorial gives energy experts a general overview to implement DR programs on agricultural lands optimizing the power system operation.

This is the first global study using quasi-experimental methods to uncover the degree to which land improvements matter for poverty reduction. We draw three main conclusions. First, land improvements are important for poverty reduction in rural areas and particularly so for Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, land improvements are pro-poor: poorer areas see larger poverty alleviation effects due to improvements in land.

In practice, however, centralized organizations can have its own inefficiencies and decentralized management can do relatively well.

This paper, in contrast, draws upon the unique history of New Mexico, leveraging a natural experiment to assess how the partial transition in the early 20th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. My results confirm that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33%. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To date, various simulation and optimization models have been proposed for optimum design of the reservoirs and the downstream irrigation network systems. In most of these models, the minimum reservoir capacity is defined as the objective function that can supply the defined agricultural demands based on a predetermined assumed reliability level. However, the objective functions of minimizing the reservoir capacity may not find the optimum solution economically. In this study, an optimization model for design of a reservoir and the irrigation network is developed with the objective function of maximizing the net benefit gained from the system. The results are presented for two operation policies of S-type and SQ-type which are common linear decision rules (LDR) for the reservoirs. Chance-constrained (CC) stochastic optimization with linear decision rules (LDRs) are presented in this study. The discussed model which is a deterministic explicit optimization model for a single reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is applied for the Marboreh dam in Iran with the aim of extraction of the optimum reliability level for supplying the agricultural demands. Results indicate that the optimum reliability level is about 50% for the S-type and SQ-type rules in the case studied. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Among the key interventions assumed to influence agricultural productivity of smallholders is the provision of agricultural extension services to farmers. Access to agricultural extension however remains low in most developing countries thus slowing down agricultural productivity growth. This study therefore sought to determine the labor productivity effects of agricultural extension in northern Ghana using data from a cross-section of 300 smallholder farm households. The results of a binary probit model indicated that participation in agricultural extension increased with farming experience, farm size, access to irrigation and group membership but decreased with years of formal education and household size. Regression estimates of a labor productivity model revealed a positive and statistically significant relationship between agricultural extension and labor productivity. Also, labor productivity increased with farming experience, household income, access to irrigation, degree of specialization in production and the level of conventional inputs used per man-day of labor but decreased with participation in off-farm work. The authors recommend an increase in agricultural extension coverage to ensure that more farmers are reached with information on modern technologies to enhance their labor productivity. Furthermore, farmers need access to inputs such as seed and fertilizer to improve the productivity of labor. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to estimate the profitability of rice production for irrigated and rain-fed farmers; determine the factors that influence farmers' decision to participate in irrigation and the impact of irrigation on rice farmers' profitability in northern Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using cross-sectional data collected from 543 rice farmers in northern Ghana, the study employed both non-parametric (cost benefit analysis) and parametric (endogenous switching regression) approaches to analyse the data. Findings: The empirical results reveal a significant difference between the profits of irrigated (GHS 2442.30) and rain-fed farmers (GHS 576.20), as well as the cost-benefit ratios between irrigators (2.53) and rain-fed farmers (1.37). Also, participation in irrigation was found to be influenced by relatively small farm size and off-farm income; while profitability was influenced by membership in a farmer-based organization, access to agricultural extension services and perception of decreasing rainfall intensity. Irrigation also had a positive significant net impact on profitability of rice production. Research limitations/implications: The results provide justification for development partners and the government of Ghana through the “one-village-one-dam” policy, to invest in irrigation in northern Ghana in order to improve household welfare as well as build resilience for sustainable production systems. Originality/value: This study is the first of its kind to provide a robust analysis of the difference in profits of rain-fed and irrigated rice farmers while estimating the determinants of Ghanaian farmers' choice of either of the regimes within a bias-corrected framework. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In Vietnam, all lands belong to the state, which assigns usufruct rights to those lands to individuals and households. In 1993, the state gave 20-year usufruct rights to growers of annual crops, and 50-year usufruct rights to growers of perennial crops. In 2013, as the usufruct rights of growers of annual crops were about to expire, the Vietnamese government passed a law—the Land Law of 2013—that extended the usufruct rights of all landowners by 50 years. We exploit this largely unanticipated shock to study the effect of tenurial security on agricultural investment. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the Land Law of 2013 is associated with a higher likelihood of investment by growers of annual crops in irrigation technology or soil and water conservation, but not other types of investment. Our results are robust to controlling for endogenous switching from annual to perennial crops, and our data support the parallel trends assumption. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analytical framework to identify and understand grassroots water governance practices, which we call ‘rooted water collectives’ (RWC). RWCs can be multi-scalar organizations that engage in common property resources management or multi-scalar social movements that advocate for common property resources governance. The framework, which we open for discussion, scrutinizes (1) the extent to which ‘rooted water collectives’ are ‘grounded’ in the sense they address locally perceived water control problems and resort to water-context embedded meaning, values, identities, belonging and vernacular knowledge; (2) their internal decision-making dynamics; and (3) their effectiveness in achieving impact at multiple scales. It also considers five contextual factors that enable and constrain RWC development. RWC can be deployed as a conceptual lens, but also as an empirical manifestation constituting the object and subject of research. It differs from wide-spread top-down-implemented participatory water management approaches and common property resources management research, in the importance it gives to politics, advocacy and multi-scale social movements. The framework is illustrated with a cursory analysis of four cases: irrigators' federations in Peru; the ‘new water culture’ movement in Spain; collective irrigation in oases in North Africa; and loosely structured networks of irrigation water users in Cambodia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study reviews 40 years of irrigation development in China including the transformation of the institutional and incentive structures in irrigation management. After rural reforms in the 1970s, irrigation investments slowed until the late 1990s. In North China, farmers became major investors in groundwater irrigation, leading to property rights’ transfer of tube wells from collective to private ownership. Despite positive effects in cropping patterns, farmer income and development of groundwater markets, privatisation has accelerated groundwater table deterioration. Since the middle of 1990s, Water User Associations have replaced village collective management of surface irrigation. This approach was adopted by most provinces by early 2001 with mixed results; only institutions with water-saving incentives realised efficient irrigation. The Government is reforming water price policies to provide water-saving incentives to farmers while not hurting their income. While China has focused on water rights and markets, and despite regulations and pilot projects, full implementation of water rights has been slow. Research reveals greater policy scope for expanding irrigation technologies that generate real water saving to rural areas. Given pressure associated with water scarcity and concern for food security, further effective reforms in irrigation and policy incentives are expected. The Government has also initiated some pilot projects to resolve increasing water scarcity problems through adjusting agricultural production activities. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

	abstract = {The governance of common-pool resources, such as irrigation systems, is a highly debated topic in research. Numerous studies suggest that actors can successfully manage these resources through cooperation, especially in hybrid governance structures, if they are able to design and enforce their own rules. Thereby, certain factors, such as the composition of a group of resource users, influence the likelihood of cooperation and the performance of self-managed resource systems. This study employed an economic framed field experiment to compare the effects of externally imposed and self-set rules of water distribution on homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of irrigation users who differ in their economic endowment. The experiment was conducted with 20 farmers in an Uzbek community. Furthermore, questionnaires, group discussions and interviews complemented the analytical method. The results show that groups, homogeneous in their economic endowment are more inclined to comply with self-designed rules than groups that are economically heterogeneous. Thus, homogenous groups achieve a better performance in terms of resource maintenance and water harvest under self-governance. However, water distribution was more equal and the illegal activities decreased in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups with self-implemented rules. It was found that trust was a crucial factor regarding both greater individual rule adherence and more cooperative behavior within homogeneous entities compared to heterogeneous groups of irrigation users. Finally, the results support the argument that economic heterogeneity among resource users lowers the likeliness of cooperation in self-governed common-pool resource systems. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach for transforming and reorienting agricultural systems to support food security under climate change. Few studies, however, quantify at the national scale CSA's economic effects or compare CSA to input-intensive technologies, like fertilizer or irrigation. Such quantification may help with priority setting among competing agricultural investment options. Our study uses an integrated biophysical and economic modeling approach to quantify and contrast the economywide effects of CSA (integrated soil fertility management in our study) and input-intensive technologies in Ethiopia's cereal systems. We simulate impacts for 20-year sequences of variable weather, with and without climate change. Results indicate that adopting CSA on 25% of Ethiopia's maize and wheat land increases annual gross domestic product (GDP) by an average 0.18% (US$49.8 million) and reduces the national poverty rate by 0.15 percentage points (112,100 people). CSA is more effective than doubling fertilizer use on the same area, which increases GDP by US$33.0 million and assists 75,300 people out of poverty. CSA and fertilizer have some substitutability, but CSA and irrigation appear complementary. Although not a panacea for food security concerns, greater adoption of CSA in Ethiopia could deliver economic gains but would need substantial tailoring to farmer-specific contexts. © 2019 Authors.

	abstract = {This study explored rice farmers’ on-farm autonomous adaptation (OFAA) strategies to climate change and evaluated their impact on rice yield and total crop returns. The study used empirical data of 480 farmers collected from the major rice-growing zone of Punjab province, a region highly vulnerable to climate variability in Pakistan. We employed the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique to estimate the impact of OFAA strategies on crop outcomes and used a probit model to investigate the determinants of farmers’ adaptation decisions. Findings show that farmers have adopted various OFAA practices such as irrigation water management, changing cultivation dates, and fertilizer management to lessen the adverse effects of climate change. The probit model results indicated farmers’ land ownership, tube well ownership, off-farm income, credit use, and access to climate information as the major determinants of farmers’ adaptation decisions. The PSM results showed that farmers who adopted at least one OFAA practice attained 340 kg/hectare more rice yield, equivalent to US$74, compared to those who did not adopt any adaptation measure. We further found that farmers who employed multiple adaptation strategies have attained higher profits compared to those implementing a few measures. These findings imply that OFAA strategies are important in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change and variability on crops leading to improved food production and farmers' livelihood. This study further highlights the crucial role of farmers’ education, availability of irrigation facilities, credit, and climate information for an improved farm-level adaptation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Participatory governance is a means of making the state more responsive and accountable to its citizens. However, attempts to involve end users in decision making are often met with considerable resistance not just from political elites, but from the bureaucracy. I investigate how and why bureaucrats resist such reforms by focusing on the implementation of the Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities Act (1997) in Pakistan, an Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) program that attempted to put farmers in charge of water allocation, revenue collection, and dispute resolution. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in 2015 and 2019 with bureaucrats across the administrative hierarchy and water sector practitioners and consultants, I emphasise the role bureaucratic perceptions and incentives played in driving this program into the ground over two decades. My argument is two-pronged. First, I show that bureaucratic resistance to participatory programs needs to be studied in light of wider political events and processes, particularly patterns of political engagement and parallel attempts at devolving power. Second, I find that the precarious conditions under which irrigation bureaucrats work make them unwilling to cede what official power and influence they do have to farmers. In other words, I contend that bureaucratic resistance to farmers’ involvement in decision-making is the result of a more nuanced set of political and bureaucratic experiences than the perceived technical superiority and colonial inheritance of the irrigation bureaucracy. More broadly, my argument has implications for participatory reforms in other sectors and for decentralized government in Pakistan and in other countries in the Global South. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In addition, we conducted field observation and key informant interviews to describe several farming practices. The results highlight the fact that farmers’ decisions to participate in sustainable coffee farming are mainly driven by economic benefits. Sustainable farming is more cost-effective and profitable than conventional farming, despite the insignificant difference in production efficiency. Improvement of education, farming knowledge, and collective actions could mitigate negative effects of small-scale production for sustainable coffee farmers.

A mixed-method approach was used, including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys. The results demonstrated that farmers have implemented various adaptation measures in tackling SI impacts. High market demand for shrimp also contributed to farmers’ decisions in shifting farming practices. The study underscores the important role of the integrated shrimp-rice system as a more comparatively sustainable model to the intensive shrimp culture in the face of SI. Qualitative analysis revealed water conflicts occurring in mixed rice and shrimp farming areas driven by the poor performance of combined irrigation and drainage systems together with the undefined water demarcation zones between rice and shrimp farmers.

However, unplanned and unconstrained groundwater use could also cause serious consequences. To extend the economic life of groundwater, water conservation issues have become the main focus for the policy makers. Taking Ogallala aquifer in U.S. Southern Great Plains as an example, this paper analyzes whether current and potential groundwater conservation policies provide profit-driven farmers with incentives to save water. We adopt a theoretical approach to analyze farmer's optimal response when facing following policy alternatives, including (1) irrigation technology subsidy, (2) increased water cost, (3) unit subsidies for water saving, and (4) subsidies on water-conservative crop. Our findings suggest that the effects of water conservation policies vary by region. Specifically, the switching to higher efficiency technology should occur in a preventative stage for the water saving to occur. Similarly, an increase in water cost promotes water saving only when water resource is relatively abundant. In regions where groundwater already poses a constraint, the unit subsidy for actual water saved and price subsidy for water-conservative crops are more effective in achieving the water conservation goal. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of electricity subsidies on economic and groundwater dynamics. The analysis follows from a dynamic, multisector and general equilibrium model in which both aquifer hydrology dynamics in the Punjab region of India and capital accumulation across India are endogenous. The model predicts Punjabi aquifer depletion which has distinct regional impacts and slight spillovers on the rest of the Indian economy. From the Punjab perspective, electricity subsidies encourage higher levels of groundwater extraction than one would observe in the absence of the subsidy. In turn, the higher levels of groundwater extraction increase agriculture's ability to compete for labor and other farm inputs. Even with the subsidy, however, as the economy transitions to the long run equilibrium, groundwater tables fall and more electricity is needed to supply the same amount of water used in the previous period. These forces slowly diminish agriculture's ability to compete for resources and the sector eventually loses resources to the rest of the economy and in turn, agricultural income falls over time. These dynamics are accentuated when the subsidy is removed, leading to a more rapid decline in Punjabi agricultural income. Our empirical findings suggest eliminating the 'electricity for irrigation' subsidy leads to double gains: An environmental gain and an economic gain. The environmental gain is a slower rate of aquifer depletion over time relative to a subsidy world. Removing the subsidy discourages production of high water-intensive crops, thus slowing the rate of groundwater extraction. Although removing the subsidy increases agricultural production costs, it makes electricity less expensive for competing sectors, namely manufacturing, which in turn leads, over time, to increased electricity, capital and labor demand from manufacturing. This reallocation of resources to more productive sectors in the economy leads to an increase in Punjabi gross state domestic product, as compared to the case where electricity is subsidized. The empirical results suggest removing Punjabi electricity subsidies entails trade-offs between agricultural and manufacturing income and has implications for long term water use. Empirical results also suggest that correctly calculating the stock value of a natural resource requires macroeconomic data and hence, may be impossible to conduct in a partial equilibrium setting. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Expectations are that the agricultural sector will have to expand the use of water for irrigation to meet rising food demand, while at the same time the competition for water resources is growing in many regions. Increasing water productivity in agriculture is widely seen as a critical response to help address this challenge. Yet much of the public debate is vague on the meaning of agricultural water productivity - often emphasizing "more crop per drop" as if water were the only input that mattered -, and approaches for assessing and increasing water productivity are seldom addressed systematically. This paper discusses conceptual issues that should be kept in mind when assessing agricultural water productivity, and presents findings from what may be the first survey of the agricultural productivity and efficiency literature with regard to the explicit inclusion of water aspects in productivity and efficiency measurements. The survey comprises studies applying single-factor productivity (SFP) measures, total factor productivity (TFP) indices and frontier models. Studies using deductive methods are also included. A key finding is that the studies tend to either incorporate field- and basin-level aspects but focus only on a single input (water), or they apply multi-factor approaches but do not tackle the basin-level aspects. It seems that no study has yet presented an approach that accounts for multiple inputs and basin-level issues. Deductive methods may provide the flexibility to overcome some of the limitations of the other methods. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {The present research offers an economic assessment of climate change impacts on the four major crop families characterizing Nigerian agriculture. The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper “soft measures” and more costly “hard” irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Approximately 83% of the farmers use at least one farm-based water-saving technique. However, the traditional, inefficient techniques border and furrow irrigation are still prevalent whereas the use of advanced, more efficient techniques is still rather rare. We develop and estimate an adoption model consisting of two stages: awareness of water scarcity and intensity of adoption. We find that awareness of water scarcity and financial status enhance adoption of more advanced techniques whereas access to better community-based irrigation infrastructure discourages it. We furthermore find both community-based irrigation infrastructure and farm-based irrigation water-saving techniques have mitigating effects on production risk. From the results it follows that adoption can be stimulated via financial support and via extension aimed at enhancing awareness of water scarcity. © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

We randomly assign participants to groups and places on group canals. Places order extraction decisions. Our treatments are sequences of scarcities: 'from lower to higher resources' involves four rounds each of 20, 60, then 100 units of water; 'from higher to lower resources' reverses the ordering. We find that upstream farmers extract more, but a lower share, when facing higher resources. Further they take a larger share of higher resources when they faced lower resources in earlier rounds (relative to when facing higher resources initially). That is inconsistent with leading models of responses to scarcity which focus upon one's own gain. It is consistent with lowering one's weight on others to, for instance, rationalize having left them little. Our results suggest that facing higher scarcity can erode the bases for collective actions.

The baseline scenario involved multiple cropping seasons and a combination of crops on 0.9 ha land-holdings, livestock husbandry, and exploitation of common property resources. With capital costs of Rs.128,180 (US$2293) and annual operating costs of Rs.37,290 (US$667), the net benefit generated (excluding depreciation) was Rs.70,250 (US$1257) annually. The pay-back period was 1.8 years, and the internal rate of return (IRR) was 53.7% over 10 years. Allocation of 20 days annually to fishing increased the net benefit to Rs.75,030 (US$1342) and IRR to 56.5% with minimal added costs and risks. Adopting the system of rice intensification (SRI) for paddy cultivation on 0.35 ha increased the IRR to 61.1%, while reducing agrochemical and inorganic fertilizer use. Including small-scale fish culture in a 0.1 ha pond integrated in the irrigation scheme for SRI cultivation resulted in an IRR of 77.3% and reduced the pay-back period to 1.3 years. Some risks to biodiversity are apparent with each scenario; however, with appropriate safeguards, sustainable agricultural intensification and livelihoods diversification could bolster agrobiodiversity and social-ecological resilience of highland communities, while alleviating pressure on biodiversity. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Moreover, production risk is often associated with adoption of traditional irrigation, and this risk often undermines a shift to more modern irrigation systems. Controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation choices clearly improves our understanding of small-scale farmer irrigation adoption decisions and we argue that weaker knowledge about and lower automatic diffusion of modern irrigation is a main obstacle for improving small-scale farmer productivity. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {While it is known that access to physical infrastructure enhances household welfare, there are very few micro-econometric studies that analyze its role in mitigating chronic and transient poverty. This paper aims to bridge this gap in the existing literature by evaluating the impact of a large-scale irrigation infrastructure project implemented in Sri Lanka. It identifies the treatment effect of irrigation access by exploiting a situation where the government used lotteries to distribute irrigated plots. Furthermore, in order to disentangle the channels through which the irrigation reduces poverty, we extend the seasonal consumption smoothing model of Paxson (1993; "Consumption and Income Seasonality in Thailand. " Journal of Political Economy 191(1):39-72) by introducing endogenous credit constraints. Using unique household level monthly panel data over a year, it is shown that with irrigation accessibility, not only the average income increases but also the patterns of income fluctuation changes and the probability of binding credit constraint declines through which transient poverty is mitigated. These empirical results suggest that irrigation infrastructure has a positive impact on reducing both chronic and transient poverty directly and indirectly by improving income and relaxing credit constraints.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different types of the village relationship influence different types of public goods provision in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - The three components (clan-based relationship, neighborhood relationship and external relationship) were derived by employing factor analysis. The simultaneous discrete choice model was used to estimate the influence of these components on public goods provision, using the survey data from the China Household Income Project conducted in 2007. Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components of village relationship allows for a better understanding of the public good provision. The results indicate that the neighborhood relationship has a significantly positive effect on rural public goods provision, particularly on water conservancy and irrigation, while the external relationship has a significantly positive effect on all types of public goods. Practical implications - Local public goods provision is the core of the new rural construction in China. These findings imply that relationship in villages plays a vital role in the provision of public goods and is necessary in the construction of the new harmonious countryside in China. The results also have implications for rural public goods provision in other developing countries. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively model the impact of different relationships on public goods provision at the rural level. A consideration of the different components in village relationship allows for a more precise understanding of the pubic goods provision in the village. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The paper uses an endogenous switching regression model to measure the impact of participation in micro-irrigation development on households’ welfare. The model takes into account selection bias associated with programme participation and endogeneity problems often encountered in most programme evaluations. A total of 482 households (195 irrigation users and 287 non-users) were used to generate all the necessary variables. To capture the impact of the irrigation on household welfare, two indicators were considered, namely household farm income (Y) and household fixed asset formation (F) (evaluated at market price during the survey period). The results show a positive and significant impact of irrigation use on the two outcome variables: income by 8.8 per cent and asset formation by 186 per cent as compared to non-users. This shows how important the micro-irrigation schemes are in improving the welfare of poor farmers in the research areas. Furthermore, the empirical results show that the probability of using one of the water sources (irrigation scheme) is associated with farm experience (age as proxy), farmer-to-farmer contact (the existence of an irrigation user neighbour), family size, the state of credit constraint, the number of visits by extension agents and the cost of irrigation development. As a robustness check, different models were applied and results were found consistent, both qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2017, NAIK Research Institute of Agricultural Economics.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the types of farming proposed are: extensive, mechanized; intensive export; intensive peri-urban; subsistence; and reserves, game ranching, and tourism. In North Africa, the author proposes: irrigated and rainfed. In order to realize the most positive benefits of these paths in 2050, Africa has to tackle six challenges, outlined by the author: reducing population growth, promoting irrigation, adapting the role of the state, promoting the acceleration of technical change (including fertilizer and biotechnology), and preparing for climate change. Increasing the competitiveness of Africa’s commercial farming will improve income, inequality, and nutrition across the continent. © 2014, © 2014 Emerging Markets Forum.},

While policy makers have looked to efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of field-level irrigation and strengthening ownership and property rights in local resource management, hydrologists have asserted that more direct control of consumptive use patterns of water is needed. In this paper, we illustrate the divergence between current groundwater usage patterns and an optimal path, in which the groundwater levels are stabilized with better demand-side management. The paper assesses the tradeoffs embedded in alternative policy instruments that are aimed at modifying the groundwater pumping behavior of agricultural water users. The challenges of regulating smallholder agricultural water users are shown to be relevant in determining which instrument might have the best chance of slowing the depletion of groundwater resources in the hard-rock aquifers of India, and promoting the long-run sustainability of this critical natural resource. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Firstly, we aim to measure the technical, scale and economic efficiencies for a sample of 170 cereal farmers in Chebika region (Central Tunisia) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. Secondly, computed efficiency scores are regressed on explanatory variables using a Tobit model, in order to identify its determinants. Results of the DEA model show that average technical, allocative and economic efficiencies under constant returns to scale (CRS) are 70.7%, 85.1% and 59.7%, respectively. By operating at full economic efficiency levels, the sampled farms would be able to reduce their costs of wheat production with around 39.3%. Pure technical efficiency, scale and allocative efficiency levels account respectively for 32.3 %, 34.1% and 33.6 % of the total cost reductions. Results of the Tobit regression indicate the positive effect, on economic efficiency, of variety choices, source of irrigation, membership in water users association, irrigation management and farm size. This suggests that there is potential to improve production efficiency through developing and implementing targeted programs for inefficient farmers, intensification of specific and targeted extension services, and encouragement of farmers' membership to association.},

The SAM segments the agricultural accounts by season and by irrigation scheme, including Nile- and groundwater-dependent as well as rain-fed agricultural activities. The simulations show that Egypt should manage potential reductions in the supply of Nile water with more efficient irrigation practices which increase the productivity of Nile water, groundwater and irrigated land. The results suggest a more ambitious plan to boost irrigation efficiency for summer rice would be desirable in order to outweigh any potential shrinkage in output and exports. Furthermore, even doubling all non-conventional water resources is not sufficient to compensate the potential adverse impacts of Nile water losses.

	abstract = {When surface water and groundwater resources are hydraulically connected, groundwater pumping may reduce surface water flows. In recognition of hydraulic connectivity between surface and groundwater resources, many states in the western United States have begun to develop systems of conjunctive administration in which property rights for surface water and groundwater are jointly managed. Implementing conjunctive administration requires an understanding of when and where surface and groundwater resources are connected. This article analyzes how decisions about water use and changes in irrigation technology influence connectivity across space and time, generating a challenge for policy instrument design. I develop and estimate an econometric model that reflects the simultaneity in surface and groundwater levels that arises due to the two-way flow of water in a hydraulically connected system. The model also traces the effect of changes in irrigation technology on consumptive water use and return flows, and the consequences for changes in water availability. Estimation results using a panel dataset for the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho from 1960 to 2011 indicate that connectivity between surface and groundwater resources has decreased over time due to declining groundwater levels. Declining groundwater levels are attributable not only to groundwater pumping, but also to a widespread shift from flood to sprinkler irrigation. This transition in irrigation technology has conserved surface water but depleted groundwater by reducing aquifer recharge. As connectivity declines, reducing groundwater pumping to augment surface water flows, a common approach to conjunctive administration, yields diminishing marginal benefits. © The Authors 2015.

Our results confirm that the returns to irrigation cannot cover the costs in Malawi. While labor-intensive irrigation expansion leads to unfavorable structural change in the short-run, the profitability hinges on low irrigated yields that fall far from expectations due to insufficient input use and crop management techniques. On the other hand, we find that the nonmonetary benefits of irrigation regarding higher food security, lower poverty, and reduced vulnerability to climate change make investments in irrigation worthwhile to improve the livelihoods of smallholders. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

	abstract = {Central Asia faces serious environmental challenges, many as a legacy of Soviet times. Many of these environmental issues involve the use and abuse of scarce water resources. The huge investments in irrigation infrastructure by Soviet planners resulted in a vast diversion of water flows from the two main rivers of the region—the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya—into arid areas to feed the rapid expansion of region-wide cotton production, and to supply the rapidly growing urban centers in Central Asia. Since water was treated as a free good, it was used wastefully and unsustainably. In addition, Central Asia has to deal with many environmental hot spots caused by industrial and mining activities initiated in Soviet times. Add to this the lack of effective treatment of industrial and residential waste water and solid wastes in the growing cities of the region, and it is clear that Central Asia faces a tremendous environmental challenge, which needs to be addressed both at a national and a regional level to ensure that by 2050 the vision of a livable and sustainable future for the region is assured. These environmental challenges, which are generally well known and understood, will further be aggravated by the likely global and regional impacts of climate change, which until recently have not been as well understood and sufficiently considered, let alone addressed.

	abstract = {Over the last four decades, the Indian government has been investing heavily in watershed development (WSD) programmes that are intended to improve the livelihoods of rural agrarian communities and maintain or improve natural resource condition. Given the massive investment in WSD in India, and the recent shift from micro-scale programmes (<500 ha) to meso-scale (~5000 ha) clusters, robust methodological frameworks are needed to measure and analyse impacts of interventions across landscapes as well as between and within communities. In this paper, the sustainable livelihoods framework is implemented using Bayesian networks (BNs) to develop models of drought resilience and household livelihoods. Analysis of the natural capital component model provides little evidence that watershed development has influenced household resilience to drought and indicators of natural capital, beyond an increased area of irrigation due to greater access to groundwater. BNs have proved a valuable tool for implementing the sustainable livelihoods framework in a retrospective evaluation of implemented WSD programmes. Many of the challenges of evaluating watershed interventions using BNs are the same as for other analytical approaches. These are reliance on retrospective studies, identification and measurement of relevant indicators and isolating intervention impacts from contemporaneous events. The establishment of core biophysical and socio-economic indicators measured through longitudinal household surveys and monitoring programmes will be critical to the success of BNs as an evaluation tool for meso-scale WSD. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The results suggest that cost effectiveness and loan repayment concerns serve as barriers to reaching the poor. They also suggest the inability of the microfinance program to mitigate credit market imperfections in the presence of output market imperfections, and this implication can be generalized for the microfinance industry worldwide.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the interactions and feedbacks between the drivers of forest cover and other land uses by building a novel longitudinal dataset and adopting alternative modeling strategies. Our longitudinal dataset integrates land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) information, derived by interpreting satellite imagery, with social-economic statistics across eight counties in Heilongjiang over a period of 37 years. Employing both instrument variable and system of equations methods, our models capture the inherent endogeneity embedded in the land-use changes and the effects of such factors as demographic change, economic development, and management transition on the forest condition. To validate the robustness of our models, a series of identification, endogeneity, and other tests are conducted. Our results demonstrate the dominant role of agricultural expansion in forestland loss as well as the importance of considering the substitution between forestland and wetland in analyzing the drivers of LULCC in general and deforestation in particular. The significant coefficient of the Natural Forest Protection Program implies that it has played a positive role in protecting local forests. The positive coefficient of built-up area in the farmland equation suggests a strong link between farming and residential/commercial construction; likewise, the negative coefficient of irrigation indicates that wetland loss is adversely affected by the change in local cropping pattern. It is hoped that these and other findings will improve our knowledge of the forest dynamics and their socioecological drivers, leading to more effective policy making and implementation and, ultimately, better resource conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This research presents a hydro-economic model of the Middle-Guadiana basin, Spain, to assess potential effects of climate change on irrigated agriculture and options for adaptation. It combines a farm-based economic optimisation model with the hydrologic model WEAP, and represents the socio-economic, agronomic and hydrologic systems in a spatially-explicit manner covering all dimensions and scales relevant to climate change. Simulated scenarios include a severe A2 climate change scenario up to 2070, two policy-based adaptation scenarios, and autonomous adaptation. Results showthat climate change may impact severely irrigation systems reducing water availability and crop yields, and increasing irrigation water requirements. The risk faced by farmers is determined by technology and water use efficiency but also by spatial location and decisions made in neighbouring irrigation areas. The analysis of adaptation strategies underscores the role of current EU water policy in facilitating adaptation. Overall, the applied framework proved to be a useful tool for supporting water and climate change policymaking. It contributes to improve understanding about potential impacts of climate change, multi-scale vulnerability and the scope for adaptation. © 2015 The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach - This paper applied the Chinese Agricultural Policy Analysis model, in combination with the findings from agronomic literature with highly detailed agricultural census data, to conduct equilibrium analysis under alternative impact (seasonal drought and climate warming) scenarios and adaptation scenarios (promoting water-saving irrigation, introducing new varieties, and the integrated) associated with climate change. Findings - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting yield reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production (by ~8 percent at a national scale). The application of water saving techniques can be an effective solution to seasonal drought. Introducing new varieties will increase the combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production. Research limitations/implications - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting sown area reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production by approximately 8 percent, despite farmers' adaptation activities of switching from water use-intensive crops to drought-tolerant crops to mitigate this negative effect. The application of water saving techniques is an effective solution to seasonal drought; it can lead to a nationwide increase in the sown area by 3.48 percent and in the grain production by 4.15 percent. Introducing new varieties will increase grain outputs and change the spatial distribution of crop production across the country. The combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase the national grain production by 19.6 percent, and thus constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production. Originality/value - Results from this study provide practical implications formulate strategies in response to climate change. Central government should reinforce the policies such as new varieties promotion and improve the subsidy method to guide the introduction of new varieties. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Rhodes Grass crop is continuously cultivated in coastal area of Salalah and Batinah region of Sultanate of Oman and created a negative impact on agriculture production. The government authority stopped Rhodes grass cultivation in coastal area and encouraged farmers to develop new area at Najed. New irrigation water policy regulations imposed to reduce risk of underground water deficit and insure sustainable fodder production. Due to uncertainty of underground water availability, investors have little data to help in making investment decisions. Under these circumstances this research aims to study performance and sustainability of Rhodes grass cultivation at new developed area. The study applied a stochastic budgeting approach to evaluate proposed incentive strategies under different level of underground water. The stochastic budgeting simulation is done by using @Risk software that allows the representation of risk and uncertainty as probability distributions. Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) performed to rank different incentive alternatives for decision makers with different degrees of risk aversion and select the risk-efficient incentive strategies. The study calculated risk premium needs to be paid to a decision maker to justify switch from present location (Salalah) to new proposed area which is equal RO 97 thousand for (Hanfeed) and RO 557 thousand for (Dawkah) location. The breakeven risk aversion coefficients were calculated under different Government supporting incentives. Under lower RAC Salalah, Hanfeet2 and Dawkah2 were the most preferred scenarios respectively, whereas under upper RAC Dawkah2 followed by Hanfeet2 and Salalah were the most preferred scenarios. The results illustrate possible conflicts between risk efficiency and sustainability. Change in water policy with raw material subsidy could improve risk efficiency and encourage investors to sustain fodder crop re-allocation activates at new area at Najed. © 2015, Ishag; licensee Springer.},

To increase farmers’ access to a wide range of rice varietal choices in a cost effective way, some farmers, organized in groups or cooperatives, have started producing and marketing rice seed through development projects in recent years. But very limited information has been published about the performance of the farmers in rice seed marketing. In this study, we analyze the impact of households’ socio-economic variables on market participation and volume of rice seed sold, using a Heckman selection model. Data for the study were collected from three Tarai districts (Siraha, Kailali and Chitwan) in Nepal with a sample size of 180, that is, 60 households from each district. Result shows that 65% of households sell 64% of rice seed produced. Households with agricultural training, share contribution to their organization and higher livestock numbers are more likely to participate in the market. Similarly, households with older household heads, higher operational land, and access to an irrigation facility sell a higher amount of rice seed in the market. Seed price has a positive influence both on market participation and seed volume sold. © 2013, Khanal and Maharjan; licensee Springer.},

Using household level survey data, we find that the use of fertiliser and paddy yield per hectare are not significantly different among borrowers from the cooperative society, borrowers from rice traders and non-borrowers. However, borrowers from rice traders receive lower incomes and profits compared with nonborrowers largely due to the higher interest charged. Considering that such farmers who borrow from rice traders are generally poorer in financial, physical, and human capital and would have even made lower income and profit without rice trader credit, we suggest policies to facilitate further development of credit markets for both efficiency and equity of rice production in Mwea. © The author 2015.

	abstract = {One of the most challenging steps in implementing analysis of virtual water content (VWC) of agricultural crops is how to properly assess the volume of consumptive water use (CWU) for crop production. In practice, CWU is usually considered equivalent to the crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Following the crop coefficient method, the ETc from crops grown under standard or non-standard conditions can be estimated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) by one or a few coefficients. However, when current crop growing conditions deviate from standard conditions, accurately determining the coefficients under non-standard conditions will be a complicated process and requires lots of field experimental data. Based on regional surface water-energy balance, this research integrates the Budyko framework into the traditional crop coefficient approach to simplify the coefficients determination. This new method enables us to assess the volume of agricultural VWC only based on some hydrometeorological data and agricultural statistic data in regional scale. To demonstrate the new method, we apply it to the Shijiazhuang Plain, which is an agricultural irrigation area in the North China Plain. The VWC of winter wheat and summer maize is calculated and we further subdivide VWC into blue and green water components. Compared with previous studies in this study area, VWC calculated by the Budyko-based crop coefficient approach uses less data and agrees well with some of the previous research. It shows that this new method may serve as a more convenient tool for assessing VWC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

However, this topic has drawn limited attention from the scientific community, and the equity concept remains ambiguous and often undefined. This paper deals with the equity among users of an irrigation system in a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. A non-linear, stochastic, static mathematical programming model has been used to maximise farmers'utility. It takes into consideration several conditions and is subject to a specific set of constraints. Two scenarios have been selected, both of them of the on-demand water distribution: an area-based water allocation system associated with a binomial water tariff (SC1); and a farm-based water allocation system (SC2). Based on the field visits and the understanding of the case study, SC2 is believed to increase equity among farmers. Results calculated farmers' income in both scenarios and showed that the economic cost of a socially equitable policy in the study area could be around 5% decrease in farmers' income. Such a policy could have effects on the total volume of irrigation water between 2% and 4% less in SC2 than in SC1, while the change in the irrigated surface is insignificant. The implementation of such scenarios would improve the governance of water policies in Lebanon generating a sustainable development for the agricultural sector.},

In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production. Since 79% of such crop production is not consumed in Arizona, it corresponds to exporting up to 67% of the water available in the state to the rest of the country and abroad. It has certain and glooming consequences on the availability of water for a state expected to see its population grow and its climate get drier. Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5% reduction in crop exports.

We contrast competitive and optimal allocations and account for endogenous and time-varying irrigation capital on water use and groundwater stock. In our analysis, we account for the labor-savings from improved irrigation technologies. We find that in the absence of policy intervention, the competitive solution yields an early period with underinvestment in efficiency-improving irrigation technology relative to the socially efficient solution, followed by a period of overinvestment. This suggests a potential role for irrigation capital subsidies to improve welfare over certain ranges of the state variables. In contrast to previous work, we find evidence that significant returns may be achieved from policy intervention.

	abstract = {Measurement errors in both human and natural components of agricultural and environmental systems can be as much a source of estimation bias as omitted variables, selfselection, simultaneity, and reverse causality. Nonetheless, partly because of difficulties in obtaining data, there is less literature on measurement error problems than on other endogeneity problems. This article examines estimation bias in the price elasticity of groundwater consumption for irrigated agriculture on the intensive margin. The price at issue is for the energy used in pumping and pressurizing water for delivery. Lacking the precise unit irrigation cost, previous studies imputed irrigation costs. We first consider groundwater irrigation costs and identify factors that can cause measurement errors in the process of imputation under incomplete information about the determinants of irrigation costs. We follow this by systematically analyzing the potential bias caused by measurement errors, using econometric theory along with Monte Carlo simulations where appropriate. We then quantify actual measurement errors, making use of a unique dataset in which energy and groundwater consumption data are matched for individual observations. Finally, we compare regression results using exact irrigation costs as opposed to imputed ones. We find evidence of substantial measurement errors resulting in attenuation and amplification bias in the price elasticity of irrigation water consumption on the intensive margin.

Rural areas are characterized by differences in the distance to the nearest water point and in water quality for domestic water, by watering frequency and water availability for irrigation water, and by the price for both. A household's perception of further improvements in water supply will, therefore, depend heavily on the situation it currently faces. The authors used a choice experiment to model how the individual status quo (SQ) affects preferences. Accounting for individual SQ information improves model significance relative to simply using the generic SQ parameter in the model, and the willingness to pay increases. Not using this information leads to a downward bias - and, in some cases, statistical insignificance - in estimates of households' valuation of health improvements linked to improved domestic water availability, as well as of increased watering frequency linked to the improved availability of irrigation water. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.},

Socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the deliberately created water resource shortage are described. Ways of reducing hydro-economic tension and related problems are analyzed. Priority measures addressing Crimea’s water supply and results of their implementation are considered, as well as regional development programs. The study has shown that the territorial redistribution of local water resources (river runoff and groundwater) can provide Crimea with drinking and public water. However, the shortage of irrigation water remains a problem, because the region does not have water resources to the extent necessary for irrigated agriculture. Large reserves for increasing water resources are related to reducing their losses (both in housing and communal services and in land reclamation) and rational water use (especially by decreasing or halting the use of clean drinking water for technical needs). We believe that a major way to decrease the water resource shortage and to meet agricultural and industrial needs is desalination of seawater. International practice has proved the efficiency of such a method. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

Methodology/approach-Ethnographic interviewing of 39 western Kansas farmers, state water management personnel, and archival research. Findings-Farmers occupy an ambiguous position as petty capitalists who focus attention on their own farms with seasonal planning horizons, and they hold a view of "good stewardship" that melds economic and noneconomic considerations, and that provides a rationale for unsustainable irrigation practices. The state resolves the contradiction between the finite groundwater resource and ideological commitments to economic growth by devolving responsibility for water management to groundwater users. Research limitations/implications-While the small sample size is likely to be representative of the larger pool of irrigators, further research with other farmers representative of the region will be necessary to verify findings. Social implications-Depletion of the Ogallala aquifer contributes to farm consolidation and community decline, and the ecological costs will leave future farmers and remaining communities without the benefits of groundwater. Western Kansas will likely have to revert to a system of dryland farming. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Information from Australia's agricultural census in 2011, as well as a specialized irrigation farm survey sample of 1499 observations, compared certified-organic and conventional irrigation water-use. Census and survey results found some evidence for some industries that organic irrigation farms are less water-use efficient (i.e. water use divided by tonne of output), but little significant difference in water-used per irrigated hectare was found overall (although for some industry sectors-notably horticulture-organic farms use less water on a per-hectare basis). After controlling for self-selection, regression model results also indicated that organic irrigation farms use less absolute water than conventional farms; use a smaller percentage of water received; and are more water-use productive (i.e. water use divided by net farm income). A lack of significance for the importance of irrigation infrastructure adoption, plus the importance of water-use charges in reducing water demand, suggests a need for governments to reorientate irrigation policy towards more multi-layered and inclusive practices that promote better soil conditions and water management, rather than focussing on providing subsidies for technology adoption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Based on village-level primary household survey in three districts of West Bengal, the present study tries to understand the groundwater market structure using the standard market theory. Comparing the internal rate of return of private investors on groundwater irrigation with past studies, it is found that although the degree of monopoly has gone down in the state over time, a certain element of monopoly still exists in the groundwater market. The estimates of price-tomarginal cost ratios and the Lerner index amply demonstrate the existence of high degree of monopoly in groundwater market. The study also shows that since banks give loans based on collateral, it is the large farmland owners who benefit from these bank loans for installation of electric submersibles for groundwater irrigation. Factors such as availability of rain and canal water, advance payment for water, distance of the land from the irrigation source, and maintenance and labour cost of water extraction mechanism also affect the price of water. As the groundwater extraction increases, it leads to lowering of the groundwater table leading to increasing cost for the water seller who in effect transfers the increasing cost to price leading to a rise in groundwater prices. This is a cause of concern not only for the small and marginal farmers but also for the sustainability of groundwater. © 2018 SAGE Publications India Pvt. Ltd.},

Furthermore, by integrating Ostrom's design principles and a dynamic game approach, the study examines the robustness of participative institutions and their operational rules when dealing with climate change generating uncertainty about availability of water resources at local level. Water governance can find a pivotal actor in local institutions (e.g. users' associations) not only if their organization is based on social cohesion, reciprocity, trust, information sharing and accountability concepts, but also and preliminarily, if higher-level external conditions like public recognition and control, inclusion in collective decisionmaking processes, and operative subsidiarity are met.},

Within Micronesia, robust economic development followed only in Palau where individual property rights were well defined. We show that well-defined property rights in Korea and Taiwan secured land taxation and enabled farmers to obtain bank loans for irrigation systems. Considering Japanese colonies, we use the presence or absence of a land survey as an instrument to identify the causal impact of new institutions.

	abstract = {Internationally shared basins supply 60 % of global freshwater supply, are home to about 1/3 of the world’s population, and are focal points for interstate conflict and, as importantly, cooperation. To manage these waters, states have developed a large set of formal treaties, but until now these treaties have been difficult to access and systematically assess. This paper presents and makes publicly available the assembly and organization of the largest known collection of transboundary water agreements in existence. We apply for the first time a “lineage” concept to differentiate between independent agreements and groups of legally related texts, spatially reference the texts to a global basin database, and identify agreement purposes, goals and a variety of content areas. The 688 agreements identified were signed between 1820 and 2007 and constitute 250 independent treaties which apply to 113 basins. While the scope and content varies widely, these treaties nominally govern almost 70 % of the world’s transboundary basin area. In terms of content, treaties have shifted from an earlier focus on regulation and development of water resources to the management of resources and the setting of frameworks for that management. While “traditional” issues such as hydropower, water allocation and irrigation are still important, the environment is now the most commonly mentioned issue in treaty texts. Treaties are also increasingly likely to include data and information sharing provisions, have conflict resolution mechanisms, and include mechanisms for participation beyond traditional nation-state actors. Generalizing, treaties have become more comprehensive over time, both in the issues they address and the tools they use to manage those issues cooperatively. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Incorporating water into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model operating at global scale can be extremely demanding due to the absence of standardized data, the sheer dimensions caused by intersecting river basins with countries, and difficulties to model demand for and supply of water. This has led many authors to introduce water in their CGE modeling framework in different ways and at different spatial and sectoral aggregation levels. Of course, simplifying market for water and sacrificing the geographical realism risk introducing errors caused by inappropriate aggregation. In this paper, we use an elaborate global CGE model to investigate the three most commonly practiced simplifications: (1) tackling global questions in a national level model; (2) collapsing irrigated and rainfed crop production into a single sector; and (3) removing river basin boundaries within a country. In each case, we compare their performance in predicting the impacts of future irrigation scarcity on international trade, crop output, land use change and welfare, relative to the full scale model. As might be expected, the single region model does a good job of matching outcomes for that region, although changes in bilateral trade can entail significant errors. When it comes to the elimination of sub-national river basins and irrigation location, we find that, if the research question has to do with changes in national-scale trade, production and welfare changes, it may be sufficient to ignore the sub-national hydrological boundaries in global economic analysis of water scarcity. However, when decision makers have an interest in the distribution of inputs and outputs within a region, preserving the river basin and sectoral detail in the model brings considerable added value to the analysis. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Focusing on the timing of water allocations, we explore inherent differences in the demand for water by two key irrigation sectors: annual and perennial producers. The analysis explores the reliability of alternative water property right bundles and how reduced allocations across time influence alternative responses by producers. Our findings are then extended to explore how management strategies could adapt to two possible future drier state types: (i) where an average reduction in water supply is experienced; and (ii) where drought becomes more frequent. The combination of these findings is subsequently used to discuss the role water reform policy plays in dealing with current and future climate scenarios. © 2017 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

This paper presents an urban residential water demand modeling framework that can predict end-use water demand at multiple scales, especially at small scales with a robust explanatory capacity. This is achieved by integrating the complex water demand dynamics of urban residential water use and their underlying variables into a single model. The model described in this study can predict shower, toilet, tap, dishwasher, clothes washer, irrigation, evaporative cooler, bath, and other uses which account for the entire household water use. The model aims to predict water demand at multiple spatial (household/cluster/suburb) and temporal scales (hourly, daily, weekly and seasonal) by considering behavioral differences triggered by factors such as seasonality and presence of people at home. The model incorporates an improved representation of spatial variability by considering behavioral differences between customer groups, and improves the capability to deal with areas with different demographic and housing characteristics. This research confirms the capacity of stochastic modeling methods to represent unexplained behavior of water consumers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The optimal water allocation equates the marginal social value of water across different uses. A simplified illustration allocates water from the Goulburn River in northern Victoria, Australia, between environmental water to increase numbers of Golden Perch (GP) fish stocks and irrigation demand for water for dairy farmers. The value of water for GP is developed using a combination of fish numbers as an ecological response function of water and Choice Model estimates of willingness to pay by Victorian households for improved fish stocks. Irrigation demand for water by dairy farmers is developed using a Linear Programming study. The complex ecological response functions require a numerical search model to evaluate the socially efficient allocation of water between the different uses. The shadow price of water as optimally allocated between the environmental and agricultural uses is developed as seasonal water availability varies. Further development of the framework could include identifying dependencies within the ecological responses and incorporating multiple ecological and agricultural responses in an expanded model. The policy implications include information on the socially efficient allocation of limited water between irrigation and the environment and the value of water when shared optimally between uses. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {As rice constitutes the major share in cereal consumption in South and East Asian countries that ranges from as low as 40 per cent in India to 97 per cent in Myanmar, to ensure food security, governments in these countries are encouraging farmers to adopt hybrid rice. This is mainly because hybrid rice provides a yield gain of 15-20 per cent over conventionally bred varieties in general. Yet, despite strenuous government efforts, farmers' adoption rates have remained low in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam compared with China. Although studies often claim that higher seed costs and inferior grain quality are the major factors limiting hybrid rice adoption, very few studies examine the importance of socio-economic factors and infrastructure in the adoption of hybrid rice. Using Bangladesh as a case, a comparative analysis has been made on the adoption of hybrid and modern varieties relative to traditional rice varieties and land allocation to these varieties. Econometric results indicate that general land characteristics, loan facilities and general infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation facilities and the availability of government-approved seed dealers, significantly influence the adoption of hybrid and modern rice varieties and land allocation to these varieties compared with traditional varieties. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

	abstract = {South Africa, a main food exporter in SADC, is characterised by a dual agricultural economy consisting of a well-developed commercial sector and smallholder, often subsistence, farming. Using the Ricardian cross-sectional framework, we examine the impact of climate change on a nationwide sample of crop, horticulture, livestock and mixed commercial farming systems. We find that a simultaneous decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature will reduce productivity; and that an increase in temperature alone negatively affects farm output more than a decrease in precipitation. One of the most robust findings is the difference in the extent to which different commercial production systems will be impacted. That is, the results indicate that the strongest impact will be amongst specialised commercial crop farming system. In contrast, mixed farming systems appear to be the least vulnerable. This finding is consistent with studies on small-holder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, it appears that despite the likely benefits derived from economies of scale, commercial farms are, somewhat, equally vulnerable to climate change. Further, a province-wise assessment revealed that areas that already face disadvantageous climatic conditions will become even less productive. Overall, the findings suggest that practicing mixed farming methods will strengthen the resilience of commercial farms to climate change and that access to extensions—insurance and irrigation—is likely to reduce the risks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture.

The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries.

The benefit from water service is compared to a water service fee estimated from the cost of water distribution. To achieve the objective, the study employed production function estimation with rice as the main crop. Data were collected through a field survey on randomly selected farmers at Telang Delta, the rice production centre for tidal lowlands of South Sumatra, Indonesia. The result indicates that the value of water service in rice production is higher than any estimates of a water service fee. Proven to be a significant determinant of rice production, it has been suggested that water service should obtain financial support from farmers who benefited from available water service. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit–2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers’ participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study tries to analyze whether irrigation technologies have reduced the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty in Fogera district of the Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia. It also assesses the possible impact brought about by irrigation technologies on households' per capita consumption expenditure. Foster- Greer-Thorbeck (FGT) index and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) were used for analyzing the data collected from 180 farm households through formal survey techniques. The result indicated that annual per capita consumption expenditure of irrigation technology users is better than that of non-users. Among the different irrigation technology user groups, per capita consumption expenditure of diversion irrigation users is higher followed by that of motor pump users and treadle pump users in that order. Results from FGT index showed that users of different irrigation technologies are in a better position in terms of incidence, depth, and severity of poverty as compared to the non-users group. The PSM result also indicated that irrigation has increased per capita consumption expenditure of user households by 21 percent. It is, therefore, necessary to develop small-scale irrigation technologies and to encourage farm households to use the technologies in order to reduce poverty.},

However, data is seldom available at the required scale. This study overcomes this hurdle by gathering data via an expert elicitation protocol. We report experts’ judgements about two topics: i) the impacts from climate change on crop yields in three communities located in the Bolivian Altiplano; and ii) the effectiveness of specific irrigation techniques in mitigating the impacts from climate change in the communities under study. Our gathered data allow us to document heterogeneity of expected impacts across communities –with one community expected to experience an increase in yields under wet climate change scenarios. Experts judge irrigation as an effective mitigation tool under most of the dry climate change scenarios presented to them. We believe that our data collection strategy represents a promising decision support tool for a wide range of public policy issues. Particularly, when monetary and time constraints converge with the lack of scientific information. In addition, the information gathered with this methodology can be incorporated into participatory methodologies gathering information from local social-ecological systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there is little evidence from Malawi or elsewhere to confirm whether irrigation improves nutritional status at household level. Using data from the Third Malawi Integrated Household Survey of 2010/11, this article presents a basic assessment of whether increased use of irrigated farming by smallholders in Malawi might result in better nutritional outcomes for children in Malawian farm households and more diverse diets in these households. The association between the use of irrigation by farm households and the growth performance of their children aged six months to five years was positive but weak and not significant (P>0.05). The positive association between irrigated farming and the diversity in the foods consumed by farm households was somewhat stronger and significant (P<0.05). In particular, irrigation is shown to be an important component in reducing seasonality in household dietary diversity. © 2015 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

Discussion and research on the sustainability of the system has evolved on two contrasted alternative options for production technologies to traditional system. On the one hand reduced and no tillage systems aim to more extensive technical operations reducing costs and maintaining production, or even to increase it in the long run as soil fertility improves. On the other hand, input intensification using irrigation, as a complement in the last stage of crop cycle or always when needed, aimed to increase system production levels. To evaluate competitiveness and sustainability of arable crop system we evaluated traditional rotation technology and alternative no tillage and irrigation systems and analyze their farm economic results as well as their energy efficiency and environmental impacts. The analysis of the impact of no tillage and irrigation on arable land production system showed that both alternatives contributed to cost savings and profit earnings, energy savings and reduced GHG emissions, increasing physical and economic factor efficiency. Research and technological development of both options are worthwhile to promote competitiveness and sustainability of arable crop production systems of the Alentejo region in Portugal.},

The present study has been conducted during 2010-11 to investigate the effect of agricultural credit on wheat and cotton crops productivity in Sahiwal district. The data were collected from 100 farmers, among which half were loanee while the other half were non-loanee farmers. A Cobb Douglas production function was employed to assess the effect of various agronomic and production variables on productivity of wheat and cotton crops. The analysis estimated the coefficients of seed cost (scost), irrigation cost (ircost) and agricultural credit (dummy variable for credit) as 0.378, 0.098 and 0.026, respectively for wheat. All the variables were found to be highly significant for wheat crop. While in case of cotton, all variables except irrigation cost were significant at 1 percent while the variable of seed bed preparation was significant at 7 percent level of significance. Since agricultural credit has a significant role in enhancing the productivity of these crops, therefore, the study suggests of devising easy lending procedure, financing agricultural machinery on subsidized rates and creating the awareness regarding agricultural loans. These measures will enhance loan disbursement to farmers considered to be imperative for increasing productivity of wheat and cotton crops. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

	abstract = {Climate change affects crop production in two ways: changes in GDP and population and changes in climate variables, especially temperature and precipitation. This study aims to investigate preliminary effects of climate change impacts on Thailand’s rice production, consumption, and export capacity by integrated EPIC model and the world and Thai rice market models. Therefore, the Biophysical process model (EPIC model) and Economic processes model are employed as the research methodology of this study. Main findings of the comparison showed both rice production and export in the base year (2007) are likely to expand until 2027, and there will be a sufficient amount of rice surplus for export, which is nearly the same level as that of domestic consumption in A2 scenario. In 2017, the amount of rice production will be only slightly higher than the domestic demand, leaving a small rice surplus of up to 2 million tons for export, compared to 14 million tons in 2016. However, in B2 scenario, the rice production capacity will be much lower than the domestic demand, meeting only half of it in 2017. From 2017 to 2019, the rice production capacity will undergo a constant fall and no longer meet the market demand as a result; it is estimated that there will be a shortage of approximately 0.038 to 0.218 ton. It is therefore important to note that if B2 scenario became reality in 2017, the rice production capacity of Thailand would nearly fail to meet the minimum level of domestic demand. However, we assure that Thailand still have land where can be converted to rice production with multiple cropping through irrigation investment, while comprehensive technical adaptation and mitigation to enhance farmer benefits are required. © 2015 Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Income depended strongly on low wages for day laborers, free irrigation water, and stable prices of the main crop, coconut. Diversification of production and improved market access can help to improve farmers’ income situation. Moderate water pricing can raise the awareness of water scarcity and lead to implementation of water saving production methods. © 2014. All Rights Reserved.},

The severity of droughts, however, has reduced. An assessment of their impact reveals a decline in drought-induced losses in rice yield, in absolute as well as relative terms. The weakening effect of droughts is attributed to improvements in farmers' adaptive capacity due to expansion of irrigation facilities and increased availability of improved varieties for the rainfed production systems, along with other coping strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The study considered the case of Teesta river basin and estimates the water demand of upstream, downstream region as well as entire Teesta river basin shared by India and Bangladesh. The water productivity method exercised in the study demonstrates that 2648 and 1971 cumec water is required to fulfill the irrigation demand of command and irrigable areas, respectively, of entire Teesta basin throughout the year against 198, 1472, 793 cumec water discharge in dry, monsoon and lean season. Although there is a substantial water demand for the hydropower projects in the upstream, it is appeared that water required only by the upstream irrigation project is beyond the water supply capacity of the Trans-Himalayan river Teesta during dry and lean season. This may underpin the shortage of water in the lower riparian country, which fuels the zero-sum game in the river basin, where one player is affected by the intervention of the another player. The result from this analysis with zero-sum game perspective may be useful for reviewing transboundary water policies, basin management and development, sustainable water resource management and water sharing mechanism among countries in the transboundary river basin. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the mainstay of most African economies and economic performance in these countries is intricately linked to the performance of the agricultural sector. Indeed, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the majority of the population resides in rural areas and the majority of farmers (up to 80%) are smallholders. However, productivity of these smallholder farmers is low compared to other developing regions, and this has perpetuated poverty in rural Africa. Agriculture has the greatest potential to reduce poverty in rural Africa. This special issue looks at efforts to transform agriculture in rural SSA to not only raise incomes of farmers, but to also foster broader structural transformation of African economies. The focus is on what needs to be done from a policy and practical point of view to kick-start, and in some cases, entrench structural transformation of the agricultural sector, taking cognizance of the need to transform across the value chain. Commitment by African governments, through initiatives such as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, is a starting point. Over and above this, there is need to better understand why smallholder farmers are reluctant to invest in modern agricultural technologies, including use of modern seeds and fertilisers. Further, there are several constraints to be overcome for structural transformation of African agriculture to be a reality. These include: investing in development and diffusion of new and appropriate agricultural technologies; investing in infrastructure, including irrigation; addressing post-harvest challenges that small holder farmers face, etc. To better entrench the impacts, structural transformation in agriculture should happen concurrently with structural transformation of the rest of the economy, thus allowing for better allocation of scarce resources throughout the economy. © The Author 2017.

The dictator and public goods games are conducted among rice farmers in irrigated and non-irrigated areas in the Philippines. We find the neighborhood effects but the magnitude and statistical significance of endogenous social effects vary with the irrigation availability, type of social behavior, and type of neighborhood. Altruistic and cooperative behaviors are significantly influenced by the behaviors of neighbors only in the irrigated area, where social ties are strengthened through collective irrigation management. Through this effect, irrigated farmers' social behaviors become similar to those of one another. Neighborhood effects for cooperative behavior are stronger among farm plot neighbors than among residential neighbors, which may reflect their interactions in irrigation management. Although non-dynamic, these findings are consistent with the theory of social norm evolution through common pool resource management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

The main findings are that average technical, allocative, and overall economic efficiency are 0.35, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. In a second stage analysis, we find that farmers' perception of water scarcity, water price and irrigation infrastructure increase irrigation water allocative efficiency, while land fragmentation decreases it.

	abstract = {Over the past three decades, scholars have studied the effects of more than three dozen factors on collective action in the commons but little is known about the effects of rural to urban migration. We examine this question with the case of China, which has the world's most extensive levels of rural to urban migration. Using OLS, Logit and Probit models and data from a survey of 1,780 households from 18 provinces, we find that migration has a statistically significant adverse effect on collective irrigation controlling for a large number of theoretically relevant variables. The effects of migration on collective action in the commons are possibly mediated by a number of factors frequently identified in the literature, including leadership, social capital, sense of community, economic heterogeneity, and dependence on resources. We speculate that massive out migration partly explains the significant drop in the use of collective canal irrigation and exacerbated the significant increase in groundwater irrigation since the start of reforms in 1980s. These findings have important policy implications for commons governance in China given that massive rural to urban migration will continue in the next decade. Because of the increasing rural to urban migration worldwide especially in developing countries, the findings could also partly explain the deteriorating state of rural village infrastructure, natural common pool resources and ecological systems in many developing countries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) and Water requirements of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in Ksar-Chellala region, Algeria, for one dry year by using CROPWAT software. Determination of Evapotranspiration (ET) is important in application such as irrigation design, irrigation scheduling, water resource management, hydrology and cropping systems modeling. Estimation of crop water requirements of barley (CWRb) respected the methodology adopted by the service of development and management service of FAO, based on the use of software CROPWAT 8.0. The total water requirements for barley depend on a variety of target yields and crops management. The period of climatic data used is 23 years (1990-2012), the average rain in this period is 254 mm. The total rain of the dry year is 190 mm. The results of this study show, during the vegetative cycle of barley which is 6 months, the calculation of ET0 is 453 mm, the potential water which was used by the crop barley is estimated at 281.4 mm, the efficiency of rainfall is 69 mm and a total water requirements of barley (CWRb) equals to 211 mm, this amount distributed on three months coincided with important stages of development in barley. The supplementary irrigation in these conditions with optimal contents equals water requirements estimated by CROPWAT software that increases significantly grain yield of barely. Consequently, the gross irrigation water requirements (GIWR) of 1250000 ha which project to grow barley in the Algerian steppes regions are estimated at 3.77 billion and this for a dry year and a irrigation efficiency of 70%.},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between groundwater irrigation and off-farm employment with a set of household level data collected in North China. The results provide evidence that off-farm employment reduces both time spent on irrigation in terms of total hours of irrigation and the amount of groundwater pumped. However, these effects have not resulted in losses of crop production. In fact, water productivity measured as output value produced per m3 of groundwater pumped is higher among households with off-farm employment. These seemingly contradictory findings are explained by the increased use of water-saving technologies such as furrow irrigation, underground pipes and/or lined canals. These technologies reduce seepage losses during the conveyance of groundwater as well as during irrigation of the fields. As a result, less groundwater needs to be pumped to achieve the same level of groundwater irrigation application rate in the field. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2018.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an empirical model for inflation in Uganda, highlighting the role of supply side factors in the domestic agricultural sector. Design/methodology/approach: The adopted empirical analysis is based on a single equation model that exploits cointegration techniques and general-to-specific modeling. The analysis controls for historical, seasonal as well as policy factors such as the effects of the global financial crisis, change in monetary policy regime to inflation targeting and monthly seasonal effects. Findings: Results indicate that disequilibrium in the money, external and agricultural sectors feed into the Ugandan inflation process in the long run. However, the external and monetary sectors have larger long-run effects on inflation than the agricultural sector. Other factors that influence inflation in the short run include: inflation inertia, real output, money supply, exchange rate movements, foreign prices, monetary policy instruments and seasonal factors. In addition, the paper shows that the inflation-targeting policy has been successful in containing inflationary pressures. Practical implications: These findings suggest that in the long-run monetary policy will continue to play an important role in managing Ugandan inflation through money demand management. The inflationary effects of agricultural supply shocks could be mitigated with appropriate domestic actions. In particular, fiscal policy that targets increased productivity and efficiency in agriculture through increased focus on production, irrigation, storage and transportation could reduce the effects of agricultural supply variability on inflation. In addition, policies intended to improve economic growth by expanding total output, control money supply growth and maintaining stability in the foreign exchange markets will help to reduce inflation. Social implications: Studies of inflation and its determinants have dominated macroeconomic debates in the past decades because of the importance of price stability in economic growth and household welfare. The major conclusions from those studies are that: high inflation is detrimental to investment and growth; erodes the purchasing power; reduces household welfare; and exacerbates income inequality. Moreover there is a growing strand of literature establishing a causal link between inflation and conflict. Particularly for agricultural households, the effects of inflation are usually felt through the increase in food prices with implications for consumption and food security. These findings indicate the important macro and social implications of inflation. By focusing on the importance of agricultural supply shocks, the paper contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of inflation and how the macro and social effects can be addressed. Originality/value: The major contribution of this paper is to try and model an equilibrium relationship in the domestic agricultural sector rather than using proxies such as an output gap measure or rainfall. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study finds that South-East Asian farming is sensitive to climate change. Traditional Ricardian studies at the country and regional levels reveal that net revenue is affected by seasonal climate. A structural Ricardian model of growing season choice reveals climate change will reduce net revenues in the near term by 4-8% and in the long term by 10-18%. The implications of this impact on key sustainable development goals such as poverty reduction is likely to be profound. The study finds that farmers who rely on cultivating in three seasons will be especially hard hit by climate change relative to those that rely only on a single season. The results indicate that farmers will switch from 3 seasons to 1 season per year and reduce some of the losses that they would otherwise sustain. An analysis of crop adaptation finds that farmers will also adjust irrigation, crop choice, and the timing of planting in response to climate change. The livestock adaptation study finds that farmers will move towards livestock as climate warms. Farmers will also shift their choice of species away from large animals and move towards small animals. An analysis of perceptions finds that farmers throughout the region are aware that temperature is rising and they generally perceive that precipitation is falling. Half of the farmers interviewed have begun to take measures such as those reported in this study to adapt to climate change. The overall results suggest that acting on their self-interest, the agriculture sector will undertake a great deal of adaptation on its own. However, measures taken by the government such as providing up-to-date weather reports, extension, irrigation and assistance with new varieties can also be effective. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Exploitation of alternative water sources is expected to grow in the decades to come in water-stressed countries with fast population growth, especially in regions where a further decline of natural freshwater availability is expected due to climate change. Increasing utilization of non-freshwater usually leads to salinity build-up in fields and water sources as well as accumulation of various pollutants-both having a considerable impact on the suitability of non-freshwater for irrigation due to constraints associated with crop salinity tolerance and food safety regulations. We developed a linked Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)-farm-level model of a water economy with representation for multiple water types characterized by different qualities. We employ the model to assess the impact of water shortage on the Israeli economy, where steadily growing water scarcity leads to an increasing utilization of alternative water sources. We simulate water shortage scenarios based on the Long Term National Master Plan for The Water Economy developed by the Israeli Water Authority (IWA). The linked CGE-farm-level model provides a mechanism for estimating the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) rates between different irrigation water types used in agriculture. This mechanism accounts for the effects of salinity on yields and takes into consideration food safety regulations for irrigating crops with treated wastewater. We demonstrate that, in contrast to previous studies, CES rates between different water types are not identical. The CES rates obtained in our study have relatively low values, which can be attributed to the constraints associated with crop salinity tolerance and food safety regulations. Our results reveal that water shortage can lead to a significant decline of Israel's GDP, where a considerable part of the decline is attributed to the decrease in agricultural outputs. The magnitude of the impact depends on the underlying assumptions regarding future desalination capacity. To further study the effect of desalination, we run simulations under various desalination levels and examine its impact on the GDP. We also examine the extent to which the impact of water shortage is sensitive to CES rates between different irrigation water types. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The results point to a high sensitivity of the poor's consumption to agricultural productivity as well as to stronger impacts on the urban poor than on the rural poor. The current situation is already characterized by severe food insecurity, such that a decline in agricultural productivity is likely to further plunge the urban poor into a deep food crisis. By contrast, positive agricultural productivity trends may help alleviate poverty and food insecurity. Agricultural productivity may indeed affect the poor's food consumption mainly through large changes in agricultural prices and real incomes. Cet article utilise un modèle d’Équilibre Général Calculable pour analyser l'impact des différentes tendances de la productivité agricole sur la sécurité alimentaire des ménages pauvres au Burkina Faso. D'une part, les tendances négatives peuvent résulter de plusieurs facteurs, y compris la dégradation des terres, le changement climatique, et les pratiques agricoles nuisibles. D'autre part, la tendance positive peut résulter de l'investissement public accru dans l'agriculture, notamment dans la recherche et développement, la vulgarisation, l'irrigation, les routes rurales, l′électrification rurale et l′éducation rurale. Les résultats montrent une sensibilité élevée de la consommation des pauvres à la productivité agricole, ainsi que des impacts plus forts sur les populations urbaines pauvres. La situation actuelle est déjà caractérisée par une insécurité alimentaire grave de sorte qu'une baisse de la productivité agricole est susceptible de plonger davantage les pauvres en milieu urbain dans une crise alimentaire profonde. En revanche, la tendance positive sur la productivité agricole peut contribuer à atténuer la pauvreté et l'insécurité alimentaire. La productivité agricole peut en effet affecter la consommation alimentaire des pauvres principalement par le biais de grandes variations des prix agricoles et des revenus réels. © 2017 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society},

	abstract = {Soil salinity accumulation in California's Central Valley and other irrigated areas around the world affects agricultural productivity, regional economies, urban areas, and the environment. The direct costs of salinity to agriculture in the California's Central Valley have been estimated to be equal to US$ 500 million per year. Reduced crop yields from salinity in the root zone account for the largest direct cost of salinity but these losses can be partially offset by regional and field-level management including blending with higher quality water, improving field drainage, or leaching. Effective salinity management must consider the behavioral adjustments by irrigation districts and growers, and importantly, must be based on data available at the regional scale required for policy analysis. In this paper, we estimate crop-specific yield-salinity functions using geo-referenced crop data and shallow groundwater salinity. We model farmers as risk-averse crop portfolio managers and estimate farmer-behavior based yield-salinity functions for six crop groups in Kern County, California. The resulting farmer-behavior based yield-salinity functions account for field-level management of salinity and use the regionally available shallow groundwater salinity to proxy for the true salinity at root zone. We calibrate a regional economic model of Kern County agriculture to evaluate the cost of salinity using the estimated functions, and compare these estimates to the standard field-experiment based yield-salinity functions. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of four components of social capital on farmers' participative behaviour in collective actions for constructing and operating small-scale groundwater irrigation systems on the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China. Design/methodology/approach-The four components (social networks, social trust, social reciprocity and social participation) were derived by employing exploratory factor analysis. Logistic model was used to estimate the influence of these components on farmers' participative behaviour. Information was obtained from a field survey covering six counties in 2011 of Shaanxi Province, China. Findings-The findings indicate that considering different components of social capital allows for a better understanding of farmers' participative behaviour. The authors find that higher levels of social trust and social participation lead to a higher propensity for collective action, while social reciprocity reduces the probability of participation. Other socio-economic factors and farming characteristics such as education levels, cultivated area, cropping patterns and grain subsidies also have a significant impact. Practical implications-The findings suggest creating favourable conditions for communication and information exchanges between households, which enhance their trust of each other, and encourage farmers to participate in collective affairs. Moreover, supportive rules are necessary for the future development of collective action. The results of this study also have implications for national irrigation plans for small-scale irrigation facilities in other developing countries. Originality/value-A consideration of the different components of social capital allows for a more precise understanding of farmers' participative behaviour. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The excessive use of pesticides has multiple adverse effects on the environment and human health. For a long time this problem was focused on the technical, agronomic, medicinal and pest management’s aspects, while the problem is a behavioral problem and the socio-economic aspect plays an important role. In order to study the Farmers’ risk perceptions of pesticides used in agriculture greenhouses in central-eastern Tunisia (Monastir Governorate), an ordered probit model was tested for 110 farms for greenhouse agriculture. The results showed the significance and positivity of the relationship between independent variables such as extension, use of protective equipment, experience, membership of the public irrigation perimeter, agricultural income, and the variable depending on Farmers’ risk perceptions of pesticides used. On the other hand, absence of the relationship between the level of education and the perception that it seems contradictory, but it can be justified by the age of the farmers who is high. The overall significance of the ordered probit model with a perceived acceptable level of perception can be improved by taking into account the heterogeneity of the farmers in this region in terms of age, education level, membership in a public or private irrigation perimeter and the possibility of access to extension. Developing awareness-raising methods are based on demonstrative and simple techniques accompanied by optimal monitoring and control can reduce the rate of excessive use of pesticides and guarantee greenhouse agriculture sustainable in the central eastern region of Tunisia. © 2018, Bononia University Press.

This paper analyzes in detail the first strategy for the Philippines, together with a brief comparison with the third strategy. The alternative irrigation investment scenarios also assess different regional allocation rules, expansion targets, and investment costs. Results show that on all the economic and food security outcomes, at the lower irrigation cost estimate of US$3,500/ha, irrigation development has a higher positive impact compared with investment in varietal and seed development and farm level technology. But at higher irrigation cost levels, the varietal and seed and farm level technologies can have higher rates of return, and it would be preferable to shift some of the investment to these other development strategies. If the costs of new irrigation can be kept relatively low, faster irrigation development would make a major contribution to agricultural development and food security in the Philippines. © 2018 by De La Salle University.},

	abstract = {Successful scale-up of any development project requires a deep understanding of the real-world economics of the intervention, and compelling evidence that such an investment would be worthwhile. This cost-benefit estimate is typically assessed in two ways: (a) by comparing the coefficient of impact along some margin measured in an impact evaluation (βˆ) to the unit implementation cost of the project, and/or (b) by conducting adoption studies, where autonomous adoption is assumed to indicate that the adopter has deemed the investment worthwhile (i.e., financially sustainable). However, these two techniques can be particularly difficult for development engineering projects that are large at the unit scale (or are group-based) and for projects that may have impacts on many margins or outcomes at once. Here we present the framework for, and analysis from, a field monitoring campaign in the interim evaluation period for community-scale solar-powered irrigation systems (Solar Market Gardens, or SMGs) in northeast Benin, West Africa. We used this interim monitoring to directly construct a CBA, and to document the pathways of impact actually at play for a project hypothesized ex-ante to have potential economic, food security, and gender impacts. We monitored all garden activity a the individual and group level for most of the dry season, including total production, sales, home consumption, input use, marketing, and labor (a key factor often overlooked when considering the cost of agricultural development projects). By combining production and sales data with cost information, we show that the most productive agricultural groups using the system only in the dry season would be profitable in a full cost-recovery model with no economies of scale, but that lower performing groups would not; we also show that many plausible scale-up models and financing mechanisms would be profitable. We then show how this type of monitoring can complement impact evaluation by elucidating different pathways of impact that could be used to understand heterogeneity in outcomes among beneficiaries. We document variance both within and between groups across numerous potential pathways of impact for the SMG; the heterogeneity in intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) across these indicators highlights the importance of understanding the causal chain(s), especially for cross-sectoral development engineering projects like the SMG. We conclude by discussing how this monitoring effort fits into the larger evaluation of the SMG, and how such data have been used to both adaptively refine the project, improving the likelihood for successful scale-up. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Water-lifting technologies for irrigation have significant potential to increase agricultural yields and stimulate economic growth in rural areas of the developing world. Human-powered water pumps have been used with great success in this rapidly developing market. KickStart's MoneyMaker Hip Pump is a human-powered water pump with additional design features that make it lightweight and portable for use in remote fields in several countries throughout Africa. This work first applied numerical optimization techniques to the design of the MoneyMaker Hip Pump and offers further improvements to its design. Deterministic multi-objective optimization methods were employed to maximize the flow rate of the pump, maximize the pumping height of water, and minimize cost. Following optimization, the robustness of the optimized pump design was analyzed under several modified scenarios, including fouling of the hoses and a decrease in operator power due to fatigue or aging. The set of cost-optimized pump designs was then compared to a second set of optimal designs that was found using material volume as a simplified proxy for the cost objective function. Findings indicate that several technical improvements can be made to the current MoneyMaker Hip Pump design to reduce cost by up to 37% without affecting water flow rate, or increase water flow rate by up to 88% without increasing cost. The numerical model was validated through physical experimentation of the MoneyMaker Hip Pump, and design alterations to reduce cost were experimentally shown to maintain pump performance. © 2018},

This paper presents an explanation of technical progress that resolves the apparent paradox using India’s Input–Output table for 2011–12. The idea of technological improvements has been taken from two current programs of development, namely Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) that would lead to increased efficiency of irrigation and water resource usage and increased efficiency of road connectivity across the country in a multi-sector framework. This paper calculates elasticity of final demands with respect to intermediate inputs, as also price effects arising out of changes in Input–Output coefficients. Results indicate that in order to enhance efficiency of intermediate inputs used in the agricultural sectors, it is necessary to adopt similar efficiency augmenting programs in other sectors of the economy as well. This will lead to a balanced increase in productivity of all sectors and affect agriculture more favorably. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the different dimensions of women’s empowerment influence their livelihood diversification strategies is indispensable to any attempt to empower them. Rural women diversify their livelihood strategies beyond agriculture despite its centrality to the rural economy. This study used the proportion of non- agricultural incomes to total household income as a measure of the degree of women’s diversification away from agriculture in Msinga rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. The Tobit regression model was used for investigating the dimensions of empowerment that influence women’s decision to diversify away from agricultural- based livelihoods. It was found that women with higher levels of human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills were more likely to diversify away from agricultural-based livelihood activities. On the other hand, women with higher levels of social capital and legal resource empowerment were less likely to participate in non-farm activities. Socio-economic factors including being married and involvement in dry-land agriculture increased the likelihood of women to rely on non-agricultural incomes while higher husband’s incomes and involvement in irrigation agriculture reduced the chances of women to diversify away from agriculture. It was concluded that certain dimensions of rural women’s empowerment influence the extent to which they diversify livelihoods away from agriculture. Hence, this study suggests that policymakers need to consider using empowerment interventions such as human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills to increase women’s diversification and reduce their household dependence on agriculture. © 2016 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {We analysed the economic viability of afforestation on marginal irrigated croplands in irrigated drylands of Uzbekistan. The revenues derived from a combination of diversified agricultural production, carbon sequestration, nitrogen fixation, and avoided irrigation water use were analysed considering uncertainty associated with on-farm activities such as crop production and short-rotation forestry. At the per hectare scale variability in land-use revenues would necessitate substantial increases in carbon prices for afforestation to be as profitable as crop cultivation on marginal lands, assuming an abundant irrigation water supply. In contrast, at the farm scale the analysis results revealed that afforestation can be attractive financially even without carbon payments due to farm production constraints, variable land-use returns, and the benefits of land-use diversification. Increased carbon prices would promote carbon sequestration by motivating farmers to plant high biomass producing tree species, but would have an ecosystem service trade-off by reducing the appeal of nitrogen-fixing species that are essential for nitrogen self-sufficiency of afforestation efforts. Given the modest irrigation needs of afforestation efforts compared to the cultivation of annual crops, tree plantations could become a primary income source for farms during periods of drought. Irrigation water saved from replacing crops with trees on marginal farmland would enhance the cultivation of commercial crops on productive lands, thus increasing farm income. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {In an earlier paper (Kirby et al. 2014a), we showed that climate change and a new policy which reallocates water to the environment will impact both the flow of water and the income derived from irrigation in the Murray-Darling Basin. Here, we extend the analysis to consider irrigator and environmental water management strategies to adapt to these new circumstances. Using an integrated hydrology-economics model, we examine a range of strategies and their impact on flows and the gross income of irrigation. We show that the adaptation strategies provide a range of flow and economic outcomes in the Basin. Several strategies offer significant scope to enhance flows without large adverse impacts on the gross income of irrigation overall. Some environmental water management strategies enhance flows in the Murray part of the basin even under the drying influence of a projected median climate change. Irrigator strategies that include carryover of water in storage from one year to the next provide for lesser year to year variability in gross income and may be regarded as more advantageous in providing security against droughts. Flows and the gross income of low value irrigation industries strategies are sensitive to climate change, irrespective of adaptation strategy. Should a projected dry extreme climate change be realized, no strategy can prevent a large reduction in flows and also in gross income, particularly of low value irrigation industries. Nevertheless, environmental water management strategies mitigate the impact on flows, and in some cases may also help mitigate the impacts on gross income. High value irrigation industries are less affected (in terms of gross income, though net income will reduce because of rising water prices) by projected climate change, consistent with observation in the recent long term drought. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to project irrigation and domestic water demands on a regional to global scale, in terms of both quantity and economic value. Projections are distributed at the water basin scale. Irrigation water demand is projected under climate change. It is simply computed as the difference between crop potential evapotranspiration for the different stages of the growing season and available precipitation. Irrigation water economic value is based on a yield comparison approach between rainfed and irrigated crops using average yields. For the domestic sector, we project the combined effects of demographic growth, economic development and water cost evolution on future demands. The method consists in building three-part inverse demand functions in which volume limits of the blocks evolve with the level of GDP per capita. The value of water along the demand curve is determined from price-elasticity, price and demand data from the literature, using the point-expansion method, and from water cost data. This generic methodology can be easily applied to large-scale regions, in particular developing regions where reliable data are scarce. As an illustration, it is applied to Algeria, at the 2050 horizon, for demands associated to reservoirs. Our results show that domestic demand is projected to become a major water consumption sector. The methodology is meant to be integrated into large-scale hydroeconomic models, to determine inter-sectorial and inter-temporal water allocation based on economic valuation. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

But it cannot be denied that the adoption of modern technology has taken place at the cost of unjustifiable use of resources. Groundwater depletion is found to be one of the major problems in Punjab. In present study an attempt has been made to examine the economic analysis of groundwater depletion. The sample of 120 farmers was taken from the two villages of Sunam block, viz. Tolawaltubewell irrigated area and Rattangarhhaving both canal and tubewell irrigation facility. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), has indicated the mean technical efficiency of farms 90.3 per cent and 95 per cent in paddy production and 89.4 per cent and 94.9 per cent in wheat production, in tubewell irrigated and canal+ tubewell irrigated farms, respectively. The multiple (step- up) regression analysis has revealed that farm income has positive correlation with the land ownership and ownership of submersible motors. The study suggests that the government should ensure minimum support prices for less water consuming crops. This will not only shift the existing cropping pattern but also provide the solution of over exploiting groundwater. Further, the government should take care for maintenance of canals on priority basis. © 2015, CESER Publications.},

	abstract = {Encouraging the use of more efficient irrigation technology is often viewed as an effective, politically feasible method to reduce the consumptive use of water for agricultural production. Despite its pervasive recommendation, it is not clear that increasing irrigation efficiency will lead to water conservation in practice. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a widespread conversion from traditional center pivot irrigation systems to higher efficiency dropped-nozzle center pivot systems that has occurred in western Kansas. State and national cost-share programs subsidized the conversion. On an average, the intended reduction in groundwater use did not occur; the shift to more efficient irrigation technology has increased groundwater extraction, in part due to shifting crop patterns. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Theoretically, the relationship between shocks and agricultural innovation adoption could be ambiguous. While shocks could lower the competence and capacity of households to adopt new agricultural innovations, households can also take-up agricultural innovations as a coping mechanism against the different shocks they face. Using a nationally representative household data from Ethiopia of the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) of the World Bank, this paper analyzes the effect of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks on adoption of different agricultural innovations, assuming interdependence among the innovations. We find shocks to have heterogeneous effects on the adoption of agricultural innovations. Specifically, production and health shocks have negative effects on the adoption of high-cost innovations such as improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, and irrigation. However, production shocks are positively associated with low-cost innovations such as organic fertilizer. To enhance farmers’ adoption of agricultural innovations, especially high-cost innovations, there is a greater need towards the design of policies and interventions that would reduce household's exposure to production and health shocks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of agricultural insurance adoption in Bulgaria, using a purpose-built survey of 224 farmers interviewed in 2011. The insurance decision is analyzed conjointly with other risk management decisions on the farm such as having contracts with retailers or processors, diversifying farm activities and using irrigation. Design/methodology/approach – The agricultural insurance sector in Bulgaria is presented in the broader context of the transition to a market-oriented economy and integration of Bulgarian agriculture into the EU Common Agricultural Policy. The recent developments on the determinants of farm insurance adoption in the agricultural economics and finance literature are discussed. A multivariate probit model is used in order to determine the factors explaining the adoption or non-adoption of various risk management tools by the surveyed farmers, including farm insurance. Findings – The authors find that farmers with diversified activities, using irrigation or having contracts with retailers or processors, are more likely to adopt insurance, after controlling for farms and farmers’ structural characteristics. Additionally, the authors find that the main characteristics distinguishing farmers who purchase agricultural insurance from non-users are farm size and farm location. The existence of strong regional effect suggests the importance of adapting the insurance products to the different regional contexts in Bulgaria. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the (limited) literature on agricultural insurance adoption in transition countries, currently shifting from a system where compensation against natural hazards tended to come from a State damage mitigation fund, inherited from the centrally planned governments to private and voluntary agricultural insurance. This research provides a unique data source on the Bulgarian case study. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Pakistan, home of the world's most extensive irrigation system, has followed a global trend in irrigation to devolve management from government to farmers and farmer organizations. We implement the most extensive survey of irrigation management ever conducted in Pakistan to examine variation in farmer participation in managing local irrigation systems under the new governance regime. Building on and adding to previous work in Pakistan and elsewhere, we examine the effects of privately accessed groundwater, groundwater quality, surface water, and other factors along 5 different community management responsibilities, including roles that existed prior to decentralization (maintenance of the watercourse and dispute resolution) and new roles that were created after (voting to elect representative at the higher level, collection of water charges, and holding internal meetings). Each responsibility represents a collection action problem for the community. We find that while group leader education is important in successful execution of the roles, voting has in general been taken up enthusiastically while water charge collection remains, not surprisingly, low. We find a previously unreported inverse-U shaped relationship between groundwater availability and farmer participation, and that availability of high groundwater quality (less-saline) groundwater significantly reduces participation, as does high variation in canal water supply within a growing season. We also find, contrary to expectation, that communities in the tail reaches of the system, known to receive worse canal water service, more actively participate in managing their local irrigation systems. The findings have important implications for the continued push for decentralized surface irrigation management in South Asia and elsewhere as groundwater irrigation continues to expand and equitable access to surface water remains a policy concern. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

In Asian continent, where irrigation was greatly expanded in recent decades, rainfed agriculture is still extensive, accounting for 66 percent of the total cropped area. Over the last 50 years, there has been a slight decrease in annual precipitation over China, which is supported by a significant (5 percent confidence level) decrease in the number of rainy days (3.9 percent per decade) (Zhai and Ren, 1999). There are several studies that have examined the actual variability that has happened in the rainfall in India for the past several years and the trends were varied according to the period of study and the region.

	abstract = {Water management can generate valuable ecosystem services but can be costly to implement. We examine this issue using irrigation water storage infrastructure which has the potential to provide desirable services to residential properties affected by the condition of the storage structure. We examine a particular prairie setting where concerns regarding fluctuations in water levels of an irrigation storage lake led to an agreement between the irrigation agency and the owners of properties around the lake to stabilize water levels. Using quasi-experimental hedonic property approaches with two different control groups we estimate the subsequent impact of this agreement on shoreline property values using a time series of sales data. The methods utilized in this article represent an effective approach to produce plausible estimates of some of the economic values captured by the infrastructure generating ecosystem services. We find that property values increased as a result of the agreement and that the additional property tax revenues arising from these values can be used to some extent to offset the annual service fees paid to the irrigation agency to provide the stabilized lake levels. This article illustrates the potential for irrigation infrastructure management to provide increases in ecosystem service values beyond irrigation, and also that these values can be captured to pay for the costs of providing these increased values. © 2015 The Author 2015.

Agriculture's vulnerability to climate change will depend on both the biophysical impacts of climate change on crop yields and on the agricultural system's ability to adapt to changing production conditions. Shifts in the extent and distribution of irrigated and dryland production are a potentially important adaptation response. Farmer flexibility to adapt may be limited, however, by changes in the availability of irrigation water under future climate conditions. This study uses a suite of models to explore the biophysical and economic impacts of climate change on U.S. fieldcrop production under several potential future climate projections, and to explore the potential limits and opportunities for adaptation arising from shifting regional water balances. The study findings suggest that, while irrigation shortages attributable to climate change have varying effects on cropland use, the aggregate impacts on national production are small relative to the direct biophysical impacts of climate change on yield. © 2015 The Author.},

However, farmers who would tend to maximize profits under normal circumstances face a trade-off between the choices of risky but more profitable high water intensive (HWI) crops on one hand and the low risk but less profitable low water intensive (LWI) and drought resistant (DR) crops on the other. In drought-hit regions of South India, institutional programs, such as crop water budgeting and farmer schools, have been promoted to provide support and information to the farmers in helping them make judicious crop choices. A multivariate probit (MVP) analysis reveals that crop water budget exercise and farmer field school participation, in fact, are positively associated with HWI crop choices, whereas participation in soil moisture conservation efforts is positively associated with growing LWI and DR crops. Our findings indicate that the objective of groundwater augmentation through institutional interventions that are solely based on educating and training farmers have been ineffective and have even been providing perverse incentives, and that there is a need for adding water extraction compliance components to such support programs in order for them to be efficacious. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We show that these sectoral reforms were politically contested as it changed roles, responsibilities, and authority at different scales of governance. This is evidenced by the fact that locally the relationships between water users, differently scaled state agencies, and broader networks greatly determined how water users associations negotiated the irrigation management transfer program as well as the development of new water policies. Our analysis highlights how the alliances that differently positioned actors create to navigate water policy implementation shape the scalar and the political dimensions of sectoral reforms. It shows that actors need multi-scalar networks of support to develop political leverage, overcome opposition, and materialize projects in the water governance domain. © 2017},

	abstract = {By 2050, the global demand for land and water for agricultural use is projected to increase. Climate change is likely to affect agricultural production through increased temperatures as well as through altered precipitation patterns, which are likely to increase water deficiency in many regions. Measures seeking to increase water efficiency and resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change will therefore be critical. The benefits of more efficient irrigation systems are especially apparent in regions already suffering from water shortages, such as the Mediterranean Basin, or those that are likely to suffer in the future, such as the Southern Cone of South America. However, unless incentives for saving water are in place, farmers may decide to expand their area of irrigated land, or to switch to water-intensive, higher-value commodities. Extending irrigation generally constitutes mixed blessings. In regions experiencing water deficits, extending irrigation may lead to greater water stress on irrigated agriculture. Meanwhile, when applied globally and governed carefully, efficient irrigation techniques and extending irrigation can yield overall increases in agricultural production that can reduce agricultural commodity prices. Stimulating water-efficient irrigation systems may thus prove crucial in improving farmers' resilience over time, though such measures should be supported by other economic instruments such as water pricing or water trading, where necessary. © 2015 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE).},

	abstract = {It is reported that 99% of human food on this planet Earth usually comes from terrestrial environment, and the remaining 1% is extracted from other aquatic sources (see FAO, 2002). Thus, it is indicative that land is essentially the most fundamental resource-base for food production and people have long been utilizing their land by adopting their own indigenous knowledge to boost food production from agrarian sources. An excessive population growth has a consequential effect on agricultural resource-base, where a huge amount of farming land has drastically been reduced in the past few decades; and that process is still continuing. Meanwhile, it is reported that only 12% of the total land allowed the production of food and cereals which does not seem to be sufficient to cover the subsistence of a huge number of people around the world (see Buringh, 1989). Contextually, I formulate a clear statement saying that due to an excessive demographic pressure, the farmers around the world go for a mechanized cultivation by making a transformation of their indigenous traditional food production system to a more intensive mechanized cultivation. The resulting effect is the degradation of the soil which keeps land fully dependent on organic manure and mechanized irrigation, putting the environment in a vulnerable situation. To understand this, the paper has cited a few examples from different regions of the world, and simultaneously, has described facts from one specific ethnographic case study from a South Asian community. Based on the above ideas, I conclude it with a modest caution saying that we must find some preventive mechanisms to keep our population at a replacement level. This will eventually allow us to revert back to our indigenous food production system, which seems to be essential to make our planet earth more natural and habitable for the future generation.},

	abstract = {Economic performance of two land configuration systems, namely conservation bench terrace (CBT) and conventional (sloping borders), were evaluated through an experimental study conducted during 1997-2005 in a sub-humid climate of India. Energy use efficiencies of the two systems were also evaluated. The two systems were cultivated with maize + cowpea in rainy season followed by wheat + mustard in dry winter season. For CBT, an additional intervention of rice cultivation was done during rainy season in its recipient area. Mathematical relationships were established between seasonal and effective rainfalls as well as between effective rainfall and crop equivalent yields. These relationships were then utilized for evaluating economic efficiency of various combinations of the two inter-crop based land configuration systems. Excess runoff from the combinations was considered as rainwater harvested into a common tank for recycling as supplemental irrigation during intervening dry spells in the rainy season and the remaining during dry winter season. In this way, the best combination for inter-crop based systems adoptable to a region experiencing rainfall uncertainty i.e. regular intervening dry spells was identified. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze response of the combinations to changes in economic parameters. Based on the analysis of experimental data, net present value of CBT system was observed to be 56% higher than the conventional system due to higher average crop equivalent yields. Net energy return, energy ratio and energy profitability of CBT system were higher by more than 100% as compared to conventional system, thus indicating better energy use efficiency. Benefit-cost analysis of the system combinations under different rainfall probabilities suggested that a combination with higher proportion of CBT will be more remunerative. However, the 75:25 (CBT:conventional) combination was observed to be the best for minimizing risks associated with erratic rainfall at all probability levels. Sensitivity analysis of various combinations indicated that CBT predominant combinations will be least affected by changes in considered economic parameters. From the study, it was concluded that adoption of 75:25 (CBT:conventional) combination can be recommended for sustaining crop productivity by generating sufficient runoff for harvesting and its subsequent recycling as supplemental irrigation during both seasons on mildly sloping lands in sub-humid climates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of land reforms on household agricultural investments, livelihood strategies, and income levels in Brazil. Given the persistence of rural poverty in Northeast Brazil and the existence of both land and credit market failures, land reforms remain important policy tools for alleviating poverty and increasing growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the recent National Program of Land Credit, a controversial market-assisted land reform program that provides access to land through private land markets. Household-level panel data covering similar beneficiary and control groups allows for identification using both propensity score weighting and difference-in-difference methodologies. The evidence indicates that the Land Credit successfully transitions households into agriculture, with land holdings and investments increasing as a result of the program. As with many earlier land reform programs in Latin America, the new wave of market-assisted land reforms does not increase access to private credit. While land reforms have the potential to drive redistribution, poverty reduction, and growth, these findings suggest that ensuring greater access to credit, irrigation, and higher return economic activities remains important. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Utilizing a difference-in-difference econometric framework, our results bring new and direct empirical evidence to the debate on the use of economic incentives in groundwater policy. We find that the price intervention has been effective, leading to a 33% reduction in groundwater use, predominantly through reduced irrigation intensity. We also find, to a more limited extent, movement away from water-thirsty crops and reduced overall irrigated acreage. Given that financial incentives can produce substantial conservation within a groundwater commons in duress, price-based policies warrant further consideration as irrigators address diminishing and variable water supplies. © 2017 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

This paper uses panel data from India spanning from 1956 to 1999 to investigate the ability of farmers to adapt. To identify adaptation, the author exploits persistent, multidecadal monsoon regimes during which droughts or floods are more common. These regimes generate medium-run variation in average rainfall, and there is spatial variation in the timing of the regimes. Using a fixed-effects strategy, she tests whether farmers have adapted to the medium-run rainfall variation induced by the monsoon regimes. The author finds evidence that farmers adjust their irrigation investments and their crop portfolios in response to the medium-run rainfall variation. However, adaptation only recovers a small fraction of the profits farmers have lost due to adverse climate variation. © Copyright 2017 Cambridge University Press.},

The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such exportoriented value chains. © 2016, University of Pretoria.

Only a handful of studies have been conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa and none in Malawi. In this paper, the climate impacts on rain-fed and irrigated rice yield have been assessed by combining the downscaled outputs from an ensemble of general circulation models (GCM) (HADCM3, INCM3 and IPCM4) with data from the LARS-WG weather generator to drive the CERES-Rice crop model. This was calibrated and validated using 10 years (2001–2010) field data from three rice schemes to simulate the baseline (1961–1990) yield (t ha−1) and then model future yield changes for selected (B1 and A2) emissions’ scenarios for the 2050s. Although relatively small increases in average yield were projected (+8% and +5% for rain-fed and irrigated rice, respectively), there was large uncertainty (−10% to +20% yield change) when considering different GCMs and emission scenario. Farmer responses to cope with the projected impacts include both autonomous and planned adaptation strategies, such as modifying planting dates to maximize crop growth calendars and available soil moisture, increased use of on-farm water conservation measures and land levelling to improve water efficiency in rice schemes dependent on surface irrigation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Increasing aridity, more frequent and intense drought, and greater degrees of water scarcity create unique challenges for agriculture. In response to these challenges, which often manifest themselves as lower and more variable surface water supplies, as well as depleted and degraded ground water supplies, growers tend to seek opportunities to adapt. One option for growers to reduce their exposure to water scarcity and heightened uncertainty is to diversify. Indeed, access to a portfolio of supplies is one way in which water and irrigation districts, as well as individual growers, are responding to the changing landscape of water resource availability. This article evaluates the benefits to irrigated agriculture from having access to multiple sources of water. With farm-level information on 1,900 agricultural parcels across California, we use the hedonic property value method to investigate the extent that growers benefit from having access to multiple sources of water (i.e., a water portfolio). Our results suggest that while lower quality waters, less reliable water, and less water all negatively impact agricultural land values, holding a water portfolio has a positive impact on land values through its role in mitigating the negative aspects of these factors and reducing the sensitivity of agriculture to climate-related factors. From a policy perspective, such results identify a valuable adaptation tool that irrigation districts may consider to help offset the negative impacts of climate change, drought, and population increases on water supply availability and reliability. © The Author 2014.

Findings - Preliminary results suggest that wasteland usage has a positive association with income, and that household political capital, in the form of Communist Party membership or being a village cadre, correlates with wasteland usage because it improves access to irrigation water.

Much less clear though is what fundamentally determines communities’ social capital, or the way individuals in a society interact. This study analyzes how irrigation practices, a key feature of agricultural organization in India, affect different indicators of social capital. To this end, an informative household survey is combined with detailed historical agricultural statistics on irrigation and grain cultivation. The depth of the datasets allows for fine-grained analysis of effects of different kinds of irrigation on groups with varying degrees of involvement in the agricultural production process. I show a significant negative influence of specific types of irrigation on the prevalence of conflict and an increased likelihood for attendance of public meetings, yet it is not possible to establish a broad and consistent relationship between agricultural indicators and social capital, which contradicts previous research. Furthermore, specific groups with varying incentive structures based on their land-holding status and agricultural engagement appear to be affected by different kinds of irrigation. The results underline the need for a multidimensional analysis of both social capital and agricultural organization, as well as their interaction.

We show that individuals with an internal locus of control have higher propensity of adopting agricultural technologies. We observe these empirical regularities in both datasets, and for both revealed measures of farmers’ technology adoption decisions as well as farmers’ hypothetical demand for agricultural technology. The results hold even in a more conservative fixed effects estimation approach, assuming locus of control as time-variant and dynamic behavioral trait. These findings provide behavioral and psychological explanations for the low rates of adoption of profitable agricultural technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results highlight that improving farmers’ non-cognitive skills (locus of control) may facilitate technology adoption and agricultural transformation. More generally, the results suggest that anti-poverty policies that only focus on relaxing short-term external constraints, including physical access to markets and technologies, may not sufficiently alleviate agricultural underinvestment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

I estimate the demand for security in water rights through their capitalization in agricultural property markets in the Yakima River Basin, a major watershed in Washington State. All water rights are satisfied in an average year, so the relative value of secure property rights is a function of water supply volatility and the costs of droughts are predominantly born by those with weak rights. In aggregate, security in water rights does not capitalize into property values at the irrigation district level; however, there is heterogeneity in the premiumfor secure water rights. The lack of a premiumfor district-level water security is robust to a variety of econometric methods to account for correlated district unobservables, and the null result produces an economically significant upper bound on the value to water security for the district. The ability for farmers to adapt to water supply volatility, as well as expectations about water markets and government infrastructure investment, are leading explanations for the lack of an aggregate premium. These explanations are supported by the pattern of heterogeneity in the water security premium. © The Authors 2016.

	abstract = {The present study aims to measure the technical efficiency and establish core factors affecting rice production in Cambodia. A four-year dataset generated from the central government document “Profile on Economics and Social” of 25 entire provinces between 2012 and 2015 and the stochastic production frontier model (SFA) was applied. The results indicated that the level of output (quantity) of Cambodian rice production varied according to the different level of capital investment in agricultural machineries, total rice actual harvested area, and technical fertilizer application within provinces. Furthermore, evidence revealed that the overall mean efficiency of rice production is 78.4%, which implies that there is still room to further improve technical efficiency given the same level of inputs and technology. More importantly, the findings revealed that irrigation, production techniques and amount of agricultural supporting staff are the most important influencing factors of rice production’s technical efficiency in Cambodia. In conclusion, the present study strongly recommends the development of irrigation systems and good water management practices to be considered and bring about more effective actions by the central government as well as related agencies for improving rice production in Cambodia in addition to capital investment and improving technical skills of supporting staff and rural farmers. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Rainwater harvesting is now increasingly used to manage urban flood and alleviate water scarcity crisis. In this study, a computational tool based on water balance equation is developed to assess stormwater capture and water saving efficiency and economic viability of rainwater harvesting systems (RHS) in eight cities across four climatic zones of China. It requires daily rainfall, contributing area, runoff losses, first flush volume, storage capacity, daily water demand and economic parameters as inputs. Three non-potable water demand scenarios (i.e., toilet flushing, lawn irrigation, and combination of them) are considered. The water demand for lawn irrigation is estimated using the Cropwat 8.0 and Climwat 2.0. Results indicate that higher water saving efficiency and water supply time reliability can be achieved for RHS with larger storage capacities, for lower water demand scenarios and located in more humid regions, while higher stormwater capture efficiency is associated with larger storage capacity, higher water demand scenarios and less rainfall. For instance, a 40 m3 RHS in Shanghai (humid climate) for lawn irrigation can capture 17% of stormwater, while its water saving efficiency and time reliability can reach 96% and 98%, respectively. The water saving efficiency and time reliability of a 20 m3 RHS in Xining (semi-arid climate) for toilet flushing are 19% and 16%, respectively, but it can capture 63% of stormwater. With the current values of economic parameters, economic viability of RHS can be achieved in humid and semi-humid regions for reasonably designed RHS; however, it is not financially viable to install RHS in arid regions as the benefit-cost ratio is much smaller than 1.0. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The availability of water is a global issue which is predicted to become more pronounced in the future. As a large and relatively dry continent, Australia is presented with a series of challenges within the agriculture sector. As a result, the adoption of appropriate, efficient and effective irrigation systems is an important element for future sustainability. In various Australian growing regions, different modes and types of irrigation are utilised. However, in many cases, the preferred system has been selected based on tradition and local norms rather than on the basis of effective water management. Consequently, there is a socio-psychological element in the adoption of new or alternative systems. This study reports on a project that identifies how the introduction of technology within a variety of irrigation system types has improved water efficiency, reduced wastage and improved product adoption. In particular, the study discusses how technology has improved the use of flood and micro irrigation systems as well as more recent developments in satellite assisted irrigation. The findings of the study suggest that the enhancement of existing irrigation systems through the addition of information communications technology can overcome some traditional barriers by adding specific features that are attractive to growers. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Drought and future water scarcity in the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) will continue to restructure the irrigation industry in the coming decades. There has been little work conducted in Australia that has modelled farm exit or exit intention. ABARES farm survey data were used to model irrigators’ farm exit intentions across the southern MDB from 2006 to 2013. In particular, we examined the hypotheses that drought and water scarcity positively impacted on farm exit intentions and that it is the poorest performing farms that intend to exit in times of drought. Results revealed that water scarcity impacts varied considerably. There was only weak evidence to suggest that irrigators’ exit intentions were higher in times of drought, but there was stronger evidence to support the influence of a lagged water scarcity impact on farm exit intentions during periods of nondrought (e.g. intending to exit at times when the property market was less depressed). There was also strong evidence that poorer performing farms (measured by rates of return and higher debt over a certain level) were more likely to have exit intentions in drought periods, but not necessarily so in nondrought periods. Older age is the most consistent predictor of farm exit intentions across all industries, though it was most significant in drought periods. © 2017 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

	abstract = {In principle, the approach toward irrigation management in India has gradually shifted from a government-dominated, supply-side paradigm toward a user-preferred, demand-side paradigm. Yet, decisions regarding water allocation and irrigation charges do not adequately incorporate farmers' preferences and their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improved irrigation. Since public investment on irrigation projects is sizeable and the opportunity cost of irrigation water is increasing, there exists a need to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in order to utilize it in an efficient manner. This paper presents results of a contingent valuation (CV) study conducted in a semi-arid region, namely, the Malaprabha Irrigation Project in Karnataka, India, which elicited farmers' preferences and their WTP value for improved irrigation. The results suggest that farmers predict a significant increase in agricultural benefits due to additional irrigation and they are willing to pay significantly higher than what they are currently paying to secure these benefits. It implies that improved irrigation increases not only the farmers' benefits but could potentially increase the government's revenue, resulting in a win-win outcome. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Our key contributions are (i) an intuitive description of the conditions under which groundwater extraction can be non-monotonic, (ii) a numerical demonstration that extraction is non-monotonic in an important region overlying the Ogallala Aquifer, and (iii) the predicted gains from management are substantially larger after accounting for climate and technical change. Intuitively, optimal extraction is increasing in early periods when the marginal benefits of extraction are increasing sufficiently fast due to climate and technical change compared to the increase in the marginal cost of extraction. In contrast, most previous studies include the stock of groundwater as the only state variable and recommend a monotonically decreasing extraction path. We conduct numerical simulations for a region in Kansas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer and find that optimal groundwater extraction peaks 23 years in the future and the gains from management are large (29.5%). Consistent with previous literature, the predicted gains from management are relatively small (6.1%) when ignoring climate and technical change. The realized gains from management are not substantially impacted by incorrect assumptions of climate and technical change when formulating the optimal plan. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Available cost estimates for adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies.The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led adaptation investments, real GDP towards the middle of the century will be 6.5% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta, support for changes in crop management practices and investments to raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the GDP loss in 2050 to around 2.6%.Further work along these lines for developing countries in climate change hotspot regions deserves a high priority on the research agenda in economic modelling. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Agricultural Decision Support Systems (DSS) proved useful in this regard. The majority of available Agricultural DSSs are either crop or task specific. Less emphasis has been placed on the development of comprehensive DSS, which are nonspecific regarding crops or farming processes. The crop or task specific DSSs are mainly developed with rule based or knowledge transfer based approaches. The DSSs based on these methodologies lack the ability for scaling up and generalization. The Knowledge engineering modeling approach is more suitable for the development of large and generalized DSS. Unfortunately the model based knowledge engineering approach is not much exploited for the development of Agricultural DSS. CommonKADS is one of the popular modeling frameworks used for the development of Knowledge Based System (KBS). The paper presents the organization, agent, task, communication, knowledge and design models based on the CommonKADS approach for the development of scalable Agricultural DSS. A specific web based DSS application is used for demonstrating the multi agent CommonKADS modeling approach. The system offers decision support for irrigation scheduling and weather based disease forecasting for the popular crops of India.

Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data. Findings: Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both average climate conditions and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets. Originality/value: The analysis results suggest farmers are using groundwater markets to help them adapt to climate change. Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

A crop-mix optimisation model was developed that maximises Egypt's net revenue while lightening the impacts of climatic change throughout the study period - from 2013 to 2030. The optimal cropping pattern was obtained through iteration of the model on an annual basis using the projected values of the following variables: yield, arable land, costs, prices and consumptive water use. The model is restricted by sets of constraints concerning water and land availability. These variables were projected under different climate-change scenarios using various modelling techniques. The model improves the cropping pattern in Egypt by favouring crops that achieve high profitability while using a small amount of water for irrigation and crops that have a comparative advantage in the above-mentioned variables, while decreasing all crops that are nonprofitable, that use a large amount of water for irrigation, and that are heat intolerant. As a result, the total net revenue is expected to double at the end of the term. The system of models integrated in this study establishes a platform for decision makers to examine different strategies and policies. © African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 2018.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this study was to evaluate the different feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural networks' (ANNs) potential to estimate and interpolate the reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) in Fars province of Iran. ET0 was calculated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method over 24 synoptic stations. Then, altitude, latitude, longitude and the month's number as inputs and the monthly ET0 as output (target) were used to train the ANNs. In addition, the three-layered ANNs optimized with different training algorithms including gradient descent back-propagation (gd), gradient descent with adaptive learning rate back-propagation (gda), gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back-propagation (gdx) and scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation (scg). The results indicated that scg algorithm with architecture (4 2 1) had more satisfactory results with the RMSE and R correlation coefficient equal to 18.538 mm and 0.967 in validation phase, respectively. Based on the mentioned architecture of scg algorithm, and input data form different parts of Fars province and surrounding areas, monthly ET0 maps were produced and annual one achieved by summation of monthly maps. The maps particularly annual one showed that highest values of ET0 could be found in the southern and especially southeastern regions, while the lowest values of ET0 could be seen in the northern parts. Contribution of geographic and topographic variables improved the accuracy and spatial details of the resulting maps. It is interesting to note that the fundamental capability of this model is the usage of just a few parameters for ET0 mapping. Since ET0 is a key parameter in water demand planning, therefore, the derived maps could be useful and applicable for many purposes mainly irrigation scheduling in Fars province, Iran. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Fisheries resources support livelihoods of fishing communities but are threatened by over-exploitation, habitat degradation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. Unlike the other threats, climate change has received limited consideration and reducing its risks requires appropriate adaptation strategies. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to generate knowledge on fishers’ perceptions of climate change, changes in climate variables and their impacts on livelihoods, adaptation strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions to promote adaptation strategies that would enable fishers to build resilience to sustain their livelihoods. We found that fishers were aware of changes in climate conditions manifested by unpredictable seasons, floods and droughts. Fishing remained the main livelihood activity. However, the dominance of fishes had changed from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) to the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell). Floods and droughts were associated with damage to gears, boats, landing sites and changes in fish catches and sizes, income from fishing and fish consumption. The fishers adapted by increasing time on fishing grounds and changing target species and fishing gear among other things. Some innovative fishers diversified to high-value crops and livestock. This increased their income beyond what was solely earned from fishing which provided an incentive for some of them to quit fishing. Livelihood diversification was enhanced by use of communications technology, membership of social groups, increasing fishing days and fishing experience. Adaptation was, however, constrained by limited credit, awareness and access to land, which require interventions such as improving access to credit, irrigation facilities, appropriate planting materials and awareness raising. We identified adaptation strategies, which if promoted and their constraints addressed, could increase resilience of fishers to the influence of climate change and sustain their livelihoods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Unfortunately, evidence has shown that the region has high vulnerability profile in terms of weather conditions which can affect cocoa output. Therefore, the study examined the climate conditions and cocoa yield in ECOWAS countries from 1969 to 2009 drawing data from eight cocoa producing countries in the region. The study used the crop yield response framework and employed the Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) approach. It was revealed that precipitation positively and significantly influenced cocoa output in the ECOWAS region, while extreme temperature hampered the production of cocoa. Labour and fertiliser input had positive influence on the production of cocoa in the region. Adaptation strategies should focus on investment in cocoa irrigation infrastructure to combat the varying effect of climate change in the region. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We used a computable general equilibrium model to estimate the economic impacts of climate change, assuming that it will lead to an increase in variability and a decline in the average of agricultural yields as well as an increase in the average and in the instability of the world food prices. Climate change is found to reduce national welfare, with urban poor households being the most affected. However, there is a wide variation across scenarios in terms of the magnitude of the impacts, highlighting the need for multi-sectoral approaches that consider climate uncertainty. Our analysis of adaptation options indicates that investment in agricultural research and extension and irrigation development, particularly when combined, are potentially effective means of mitigating the damage caused by climate change in Burkina Faso.},

	abstract = {Although agriculture in Nigeria is the major source of income for about 70% of the active population, the impact of agrarian infrastructure on boosting productivity and supporting livelihoods has increased. Climate change and the increasing trend of climate-related events in Nigeria challenge both the stability of agrarian infrastructure and livelihood systems. Based on case studies of two local communities in Plateau state in Nigeria, this paper utilizes a range of perceptions to examine the impacts of climate-related events on agrarian infrastructures and how agrarian livelihood systems are, in turn, affected. Data are obtained from a questionnaire survey (n = 175 farmers) and semi-structured interviews (n = 14 key informants). The study identifies local indicators of climate change, high risks climate events and the components of agrarian infrastructures that are at risk from climate events. Findings reveal that, changes in rainfall and temperature patterns increase the probability of floods and droughts. They also reveal that, although locational differences account for the high impact of floods on road transport systems and droughts on irrigation infrastructures, both have a chain of negative effects on agricultural activities, economic activities and livelihood systems. A binomial logistic regression model is used to predict the perceived impact levels of floods and droughts, while an in-depth analysis is utilized to corroborate the quantitative results. The paper further stresses the need to strengthen the institutional capacity for risk reduction through the provision of resilient infrastructures, as the poor conditions of agrarian infrastructure were identified as dominant factors on the high impact levels. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This contribution focuses on the interaction between structural change in agriculture and the availability of key natural resources - land and water. The relationship is not unidimensional; therefore, we propose three dimensions of resource-induced structural change. The first dimension describes the links between the two critical input factors into agricultural production, namely land and water. To systematize this perspective, we use the concept of linking patterns that depict direct and indirect intersectoral linkages from a property rights perspective. Second, we examinee the dimension of how structural change in agriculture can be triggered by scarcity of natural resources. The third dimension describes structural change that may lead to overuse and scarcity. In this regard, we introduce resource scarcity not only as physical but most important as institutional scarcity. To illustrate these dimensions, we have chosen a case in Central Asia, where the availability and the control of access and withdrawal rights to land and water is of utmost importance for the agricultural sector. Tajikistan faces physical and institutional scarcity in arable land. The institutional scarcity is due to the non-transparent and costly processes that need to be followed to gain land rights. Likewise there is sufficient supply in water, in Tajikistan, but the de-facto access rights to water are limited for some groups. For instance, the post-socialist irrigation infrastructure is now inappropriate to serve all small-scale users on a canal. In the future, land use change due to a predicted increase of major investors, will have additional impact on the de-facto water rights. We conclude that a solid study not only on the physical but also on the institutional relations of agriculture to natural resources is important to come to reliable predictions of structural change in agriculture. We also show that structural change in agriculture may have wider implications for rural society that go beyond the agricultural sector. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.},

	abstract = {This paper documents the utility of the online tool "rainwater harvesting and demand simulation" forwarded by URL http://gettanked.org/, and categorizes performance variability with respect to Köppen-Geiger climatic classifications of the Australian continent. This is a novel tool because it dynamically calculates the irrigation and evaporative cooling demands in addition to any particular per diem allocation of potable water. The analysis may be either from a finite storage tank of specified capacity, or drawn from water mains, but the present paper is focused on the design of secure off-grid rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS). The nominal consumption target of 155 L per diem per capita must be reduced by varying degrees depending on the locality. Higher demand can be met if sufficient catchment and capacity are provided, or if regular tanker deliveries are readily available. Alternatively, demand restrictions are tabulated as guidance to avoid running dry within the constraints of a nominal 10,000 L capacity storage with 100 m2 catchment - defining the sustainable load per diem (SLPD) during a "worst case" epoch - this is the break-point for off-grid security. SLPD varies from 86 to 124 L/d among most temperate maritime climate stations, and between 35 and 42 L/d at most desert climate stations. The supporting on-line operating manual includes tabulations of demand for evaporative cooling and irrigation together with the sustainable yield of a rainwater harvest system at 128 locations throughout Australia. Dynamics of non-potable demands should be resolved before using the GetTanked design tool for any particular dwelling or workplace. Indoor and potable water demand must be disaggregated from irrigation, pool evaporation, and evaporative cooling in order to fully exploit the GetTanked tool. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Monte Carlo simulation and probability theory, we estimated the combined impacts of biophysical and economic factors on the economic productivity of irrigation water use by individual activities. The estimated residual values vary across regions and in response to water availability as we would expect and warrant consideration of these factors in making any future water policy and investment decisions in different regions. As anticipated perennial (fruits and nuts, grapes) and high capital annual activities (cotton) represent the highest value water uses. Water trading from low to high value activities results in economic losses that are much lower than the proportional decline in water availability during periods of drought. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Implementation of water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin has stalled. The principles remain in legislation, but government priorities are increasingly focused on irrigation-based agriculture rather than the comprehensive range of stakeholders with a legitimate interest in decisions about the future of the MDB. The negotiations required to gain parliamentary approval of the MDB Basin Plan in 2012 resulted in extensive concessions. Some have seriously damaged its integrity as a reform package. Within this now fragmented policy framework, the utility of important individual components has been eroded. These include acceptance of the need for a comprehensive analytical framework able to take full account of costs and benefits, the precautionary principle, the beneficiary pays principle, consistent policies for assigning public benefit from public investment, the importance of a comprehensive whole-of-catchment framework for managing social and biophysical processes and the understanding that serious water reform requires change in the cultural values related to the water-human relationship. As a result of these compromises, the capacity of the Basin Plan framework to manage future climate change challenges and development pressures is in doubt. Can this trend be reversed? The paper argues for a revitalization of the public policy process to bring in a wider range of stakeholders and expose decision making to more rigorous assessment. To help achieve this goal, control over a substantial proportion of the environmental water entitlements acquired by the national government should be devolved to elected regional bodies (who would have to work within auditing guidelines). This would stimulate community involvement by providing a substantial activity that would make engagement worthwhile. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Reclaimed water programs treat wastewater to remove hazardous compounds, pathogens, and organic matter and provide reclaimed water for non-potable applications. Reusing water may significantly reduce demands on freshwater resources and provide sustainable water management strategies. Though production of reclaimed water is highly regulated, public acceptability has historically hindered the implementation of successful reclaimed water systems. The public generally opposes the use of reclaimed water due to the “yuck factor”, which is the instinctive disgust associated with the idea of recycling sewage and the fear that exposure to reclaimed water is unsafe. This paper reports the results of an extensive survey that was conducted to evaluate the potential acceptability of reclaimed water use. A total of 2800 respondents across the U.S. participated in the survey. Results demonstrate that a small percentage of the population is concerned about water shortages, the majority of the population practices some level of water conservation, and a substantial percentage of the population supports the use of reclaimed water. Climate, demographic variables, and financial incentives were tested for influence on attitudes and behaviors regarding water, including awareness, conservation, and support for water reuse. Sex, age, last monthly water bill, and location (as EPA region) showed no significant effect on the acceptance of water reuse, while ethnicity, education level, metro/non metro, and income showed significant effects. Drought conditions do not have a statistically significant effect on the number of reclaimed water supporters, but increase the number of respondents who are water concerned, the number of respondents who are the most active water conservers, and the number of respondents who limit their use of water for lawn and garden watering. Financial incentives influence the willingness of respondents to participate in water reuse programs, and a decrease in the monthly water bills increased the likelihood that respondents would participate in a reclaimed water program. Support for the use of reclaimed water for various applications ranked positively, on average, except for the application of water reuse for food crop irrigation and use of reclaimed water at respondents’ own residences. Results and conclusions of the survey can provide insight for implementing successful reclaimed water programs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

We empirically show that irrigation affects political regimes even in the present. To avoid endogeneity, we use geographical and climatic variation to identify irrigation dependent societies. We find that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are about six points less democratic on the 21-point polity2 scale than countries where agriculture has been rainfed.We find qualitatively similar results across regions within countries.We argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more powerful and better able to oppose democratization. Consistent with this conjecture, we show that irrigation dependence predicts land inequality both at the country level, and in premodern societies surveyed by ethnographers. © The Authors 2016.

	abstract = {We use original water user group (WUG) data from a reservoir irrigation system in China to examine the effect of water pricing policies on farmers' water saving behaviors. The introduction of volumetric water pricing at the group level, to replace area-based pricing, induces institutional change to prevent each member's overuse of water when the volumetric price levels are moderate. Depending on the initial conditions, the multiple pathways of change lead to new institutional arrangements, with all of them contributing to water savings. However, when the price is set high enough, many farmers exit a WUG for private irrigation. This tendency is associated with an increased probability that the remaining members do not undertake institutional change and that they do not end up saving water. This may be due to the increased management difficulties among the remaining members whose fields are separated by former members who have now opted out for private irrigation across the WUG. As a result, we do not find evidence that the reservoir water is saved at high volumetric price levels. © The Author 2015.},

	abstract = {The limited availability of natural water resources and dependency on mineral fertilizer challenge agricultural value chains in arid and nutrient-poor areas. Reusing wastewater in agriculture may help and could reduce costs and lead to increased added-value. The objective of this analysis is to assess the economic impact of linking the value chains of wastewater treatment, crop production and the generation of bioenergy by reusing treated municipal wastewater and sludge. The assessment was based on the cost/benefits and the added-value from the reused wastewater by the Braunschweig Wastewater Association (Germany). Benefits were assessed by comparing the costs of wastewater irrigation and sludge application with conventional disposal options, as well as comparing the costs of irrigation and fertilization with treated wastewater to groundwater irrigation and mineral fertilization. The added-value was calculated by ascertaining the remunerations received by the stakeholders in the various value chains. The results indicate that the reuse of wastewater and sludge results in: (a) the development of linked regional value chains; (b) lower costs of wastewater treatment and sludge disposal; (c) higher profitability and added-value in crop production; and (d) a high share (77%) of regional added-value. However, the results also show that the reuse of wastewater and sludge within linked value-chains can restrict actors and lead to crowding out effects on the added-value. Agricultural reuse schemes should provide additional opportunities that enable farmers to increase their scope of possibilities and compensate for missed economic potential. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This makes it difficult to incorporate water in economic models, properly examine its role in economic activities, and study its interaction with other inputs in the production processes.

As the first step towards this direction we divided the crop sectors of the GTAP-Power Data Base (which extends the GTAP Data Base Version 9 by disaggregating the electricity sector) into irrigated and rainfed categories and explicitly included water for irrigation into the cost structure of irrigated crops by river basin at the Agro Ecological Zone (AEZ) level. © 2016 Journal of Global Economic Analysis.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that the development of common property increases national welfare, and consistent with this thinking Australia's Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) Plan uses a common property approach to recover environmental water rights in the national interest. Two water recovery instruments are used: purchasing water rights (buyback) from farmers, and saving water by subsidising irrigator adoption of technically efficient technology. A moratorium on buyback has focused environmental recovery on subsidised technically efficient technology adoption. Economists argue that national welfare is maximised via buyback and highlight the limitations of efficiency savings to recover sufficient environmental water. A risk is that water recovery targets may be reduced in future, limiting welfare gains from water reform. This article evaluates possible welfare trade-offs surrounding environmental water recovery outcomes where arbitrary limits on buyback are imposed. Results suggest that, on average, strategies which attempt to obtain >1500 gigalitres (GL) of water from on-farm efficiency investments will only provide sufficient resources to meet environmental objectives in very wet states of nature. We conclude that reliance on technically efficient irrigation infrastructure is less economically efficient relative to water buyback. Importantly, the transformation of MDB irrigation will significantly constrain irrigators' future capacity to adapt to climate change. © 2017 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.},

The time period studied is between 2005-06 and 2012-13 where 18 districts of the state are used as a unit. Three types of NREGS work like, (i) provision of irrigation facilities, (ii) micro irrigation work and (iii) rural connectivity are considered separately because these works are undertaken in a majority during this tenure. These works have been measured as the total number of tasks completed in different districts in the different years. They are considered separately because each type of asset creation work could influence agricultural wage but not uniformly. Both the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors functioning in the labour market are deemed as being able to impact agricultural wage rates. Agricultural wages of a particular district in a particular period is also very affected by the agricultural wage rates prevalent in the same district in the previous period. The dynamic panel approach used in this paper shows that all three types of NREGS work are responsible for the hike of real agricultural wage rates in West Bengal but the impact has not been very strong. It may then, be concluded that, the expansion of the NREGS has little impact when determining the real agricultural wage rate in West Bengal. © 2017, Indian Society of Labour Economics.},

Farmers’ production decisions regarding maize and their response to policy incentives are critical for national food security and regional trade. The aim of the study was to estimate the supply response of the South African maize sector to price and non-price incentives. A Nerlovian partial adjustment model was applied to historical time series data of area under maize cultivation, measured in hectares spanning from 1980-2012 to determine the supply response. Results indicate a short-run price elasticity of 0.24 and a long-run price elasticity of 0.36, signifying that maize farmers are less sensitive to price changes than non-price incentives. The results confirm that non-price incentives such as rainfall and technology seem to have more effect on maize supply than price incentives in South Africa. Given the findings, the study recommends policies and programmes that focus more on non- price incentives, such as technology and infrastructure development, investment in irrigation and research services, as a means of stabilising maize production in South Africa. © 2016 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

Our longitudinal dataset integrate land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) information derived by interpreting satellite imagery with social-economic statistics across eight counties in Heilongjiang over a period of 37 years. Employing both instrument variable and system of equations methods, our models capture the inherent endogeneity embedded in the land-use changes and the effects of such factors as demographic change, economic development, and management transition on the forest condition. To validate the robustness of our models, a series of identification, endogeneity, and instrumentation tests are conducted. Our results demonstrate the dominant role of agricultural expansion in forestland loss as well as the importance of considering the substitution between forestland and wetland in analyzing the driving forces of LULCC in general and deforestation in particular. The significant coefficient of the Natural Forest Protection Program implies that it has played a positive role in protecting local forests. The positive coefficient of built-up area in the farmland equation suggests a strong link between farming and residential and commercial construction; likewise, the negative coefficient of irrigation indicates that wetland loss is adversely affected by the change in local cropping pattern. It is hoped that these and other findings will improve our knowledge of the forest dynamics and their socioecological drivers, leading to more effective policy making and implementation and, ultimately, better resource conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Farm households in developing countries generally allocate a major portion of their resources to staple food production, mainly for self-consumption. Hence, many of them are more or less delinked from the market. It is well recognized, however, that market participation is crucial for farm households to ensure a flow of cash income, leading to poverty alleviation and improved livelihoods. Thus, it is meaningful to understand what factors affect farm households' decision to sell food crops, which is important for strengthening their linkages with markets. The empirical literature on impacts of market linkages has seldom focused on the determinants of market participation. Using rice farm households in Bangladesh and applying a double-hurdle model, this article demonstrates that the provision of general education and the development of agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation facilities can strengthen the market linkages of farm households by enhancing their marketable surplus through increased production. By contrast, rainfall beyond the optimum level, drought spells, and flood incidences can weaken market linkages by reducing their marketable surplus through decreased production. Specific policies such as investment in general education are drawn up based on the findings. © The Author 2014.},

Two climate change scenarios were used (SRES scenarios B1 and A2) - which were taken from the general circulation models (GCMs), CGCM3.1/T63. The optimisation approach is performed using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm combined with a stochastic gradient descent technique.

	abstract = {Aquifers created or sustained by seepage losses from Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) Projects extend over vast areas of western states. Yet agricultural water conservation measures such as canal lining top the list of State and Federal policies for mitigating the effect of water shortages brought about by climate change. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) of new Reclamation water conservation infrastructure such as canal lining or piping is too often Project-specific, and detached from basin hydrology. The value of canal seepage as a positive externality is thus ignored in CBA. A basin-wide approach to hydro-economic modeling that accounts for the externalized costs and benefits of both canal seepage and new canal lining conservation insures that incidental aquifer recharge is recognized in CBA of Federally financed irrigation water conservation measures. Integrated hydrologic and partial equilibrium models are employed in the Lower Boise River basin to calculate the foregone benefit to non-project groundwater and drain water irrigation of a hypothetical Boise Project canal lining response to projected climate change water shortages. Basin-wide hydrologic response data is used to compute shifts in non-project groundwater supply functions and drain water supply constraints, and a base-case water supply scenario is compared to six climate change scenarios in which projected water shortages are offset by lining of project canals. The foregone net benefit to non-project groundwater and drain water irrigation resulting from elimination of the canal seepage externality (US$4.4-22.6million depending on the scenario) outweighs the increase in net benefit to Boise Project irrigation by canal lining (US$1.4-19.3million). On average, foregone groundwater and drain water irrigation benefit exceeds restored canal irrigation benefit by about 38%. Canal lining conservation is unable to restore total basin-wide irrigation net benefit to the base-case level in any of the climate change scenarios; rather it shifts the foregone benefit of climate change shortages from project canal irrigation to non-project groundwater and drain water irrigation. The canal lining CPA is not a complete accounting of either costs or benefits of canal lining conservation. On the cost side, only the foregone benefits of eliminating the positive canal seepage externality are calculated; construction and maintenance costs of canal lining are omitted. On the benefit side, Arrowrock canal irrigators are assumed to be the sole beneficiary of reduced seepage losses. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the potential effects of climate change on Brazilian agriculture by considering irrigation as an adaptive strategy. Investigations were performed to determine how climatic variability influences irrigation and whether this adaptive measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision of whether to use adaptive measures. We compared the expected land values under the actual and counterfactual cases of farm households that either adapt or do not adapt to climate change. Simulation results show that irrigation can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of climate change. The income of farmers tends to increase on lands where irrigation technologies are practiced. These conclusions confirm the need to invest in adaptation strategies to prepare Brazil for coping with the adverse effects of global climate change. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

The present paper outlines a laboratory experiment aimed to study the groundwater extraction decisions of stakeholders under alternative subsidy structures. We propose a model and a methodology for testing the implications of the model and the modifications of energy subsidies for irrigation. We analyze the performance of two traditional policy interventions—elimination and reduction of subsidy—and then analyze a novel policy: decoupling the subsidy from the electricity rate by replacing it with a lump sum transfer. Our results suggest that the rate of water extraction and the level of water in the aquifer may significantly be improved by altering the subsidy structure. An important finding for policy makers is that the decoupling leads to outcomes similar to those of eliminating the subsidy, however, with fewer political economy conflicts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Game Theory (GT), both in its non-cooperative (NCGT) and cooperative (CGT) forms, has been pivotal in its contribution to the analysis of important aspects related to water resources. The 1942 seminal work of Ransmeier on The Tennessee Valley Authority is still considered essential; it continues to inspire many applications related to water allocation decisions. Since Ransmeier, GT models were developed and have been applied to various aspects of water management, such as decisions on cost and benefit allocation in multi-objective multi-use water projects, conflicts and joint management of irrigation projects, management of groundwater aquifers, hydropower facilities, urban water supplies, wastewater treatment plants, and transboundary water disputes. World water resources face new challenges that suggest a renewed role for GT in water management. Scarcity, growing populations, and massive development have led to increased competition over water resources and subsequent elevated pollution levels. Climate change is expected to unevenly affect the hydrological cycle, leading to increased variability in water supplies across time and space and uncertainty in water allocation decisions. Future investments in water resource projects will be astronomical, needing much more stable rules for cost allocations among participating entities and over time. Levels of water disputes may vary from local to regional, state, and international levels. All of these suggest that while GT models and applications to water resources have advanced over the years, much more is expected. This monograph will review the main contributions of GT in water resources over the past 70 years. It will compare the set of issues faced by water resources and those which the sector is most likely to face in the coming future. Based on this comparison, a future research agenda and priorities will be proposed. Following the literature's time line with a focus on various methodologies, sectoral applications (such as irrigation, hydropower, environmental water uses, navigation, etc.), and regional issues, we will also identify physical and behavioral features in the water sector that might be conducive to GT (such as scarcity, externality, uncertainty, and competition-conflict) and some features of intervention (such as the important role for policy, regulation, and incentives), which all affect the likelihood of GT solutions in terms of acceptability and stability. © 2015 A.

This article utilised data from a survey of 223 small farming households in the Eastern Cape province, one of the poorest agrarian provinces in South Africa, to explore the exposure of smallholder farmers to climate change, their adaptive capacity and their vulnerability to climate shock across major agro-ecological zones. Data on the production of main staple foods, household assets and access to institutional facilities were analysed by means of principal component analysis. General circulation model scenarios were used with a crop model (EPIC) to explore the impact of future plausible climate patterns on farmers’ income. Farmers in the Karoo zone are currently the most vulnerable to climate variability. A scenario analysis also showed that maize production in the Eastern Cape will be positively affected by climate change under both low-input and irrigated management systems, whereas potato yield will decrease. It is projected that smallholder farmers who significantly rely on maize can expect an increase of up to 45 per cent revenue by 2050 under the UKMO-HADGEM1 climate scenario if the average estimated future yields materialise. Both institutional and infrastructural support in the form of access to credit and irrigation facilities are recommended for adequate adaptation to future climate change impact, in particular climate volatility, which was not taken into account in our yield projections. © 2016 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

We find that economic and physical water scarcity, climate, and extreme weather, such as frost, extreme heat, and drought, significantly impact producers' irrigation decisions. Producers use sprinkler technologies or additional water applications to mitigate risk of crop damage from extreme weather. Water application rates are least responsive to surface water cost or groundwater well depth for producers of orchard/vineyard. Water supply institutions influence producers' irrigation decisions. Producers who receive water from federal agencies use higher water application rates and are less likely to adopt water-saving irrigation technologies for some crops. Institutional arrangements, including access to distinct water sources (surface or ground) and whether surface water cost is fee based, also affect the responsiveness of water application rates to changes in surface water cost. The analysis provides valuable information about how producers in irrigated agricultural production systems would respond and adapt to water pricing policies and climate change. © 2015 The Author.},

An input-oriented data envelopment model, a linear programming procedure, was used to measure the relative efficiency scores of irrigation unions. Research results showed that technical efficiency (TE) scores varied between 0.39 and 1.00 and the mean TE score was 0.85. Based on the results of decomposition, the pure TE and scale efficiency were 0.81 and 0.95, respectively and the main source of inefficiency in the research area was pure TE. 47% of the examined unions had constant returns to scale, while that of decreasing returns to scale was 53%. The study also revealed that the irrigation area sustainability ratio and the ratio of energy cost in total expenses of technically efficient unions were lower than that of inefficient ones. The study suggested that restoration and modernization efforts should be initiated in order to enhance the efficiency level in the long term.

Given this, the major objective of this study is to develop a set of employment multipliers (direct, indirect, induced) for selected infrastructure sub-sectors in the two selected states of India, i.e. West Bengal and Gujarat. The methodology used was the input–output multiplier analysis. We have used the hybrid methods for developing the regional IO tables, combining a survey along with non-survey techniques, and we also used the NSSO (66th round, unit-level data) to get worker distribution by sectors and as formal and informal. Major findings show that employment multipliers in Gujarat are highest for rural roads construction (for formal, informal and total workers). The induced effects for both formal and informal employment are highest for buildings construction, reflecting that induced multiplicative effects are high for buildings in the Gujarat economy. In West Bengal, employment multipliers for irrigation canal construction (for formal, informal and total workers) are higher. But, induced effects for formal employment are highest in buildings and national highways/urban roads construction and for informal employment are highest in national highways/urban roads construction. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Groundwater resources are critically important for irrigated agriculture in Tunisia. However, excessive irrigation extractions where groundwater is slowly renewed are causing a widespread depletion of the aquifer systems, with the impacts of climate change expected to further exacerbate this problem. These circumstances call for the development of methodologies and analyses that can support the design of sustainable groundwater management policies. This paper presents a hydro-economic mathematical programming model that is used to evaluate the effects of different policy measures for reducing aquifer depletion in the Cap-Bon region of Tunisia. Three policies have been evaluated: a quota defining the maximum quantity of groundwater extractions, environmental taxation, and supply expansion with subsidized desalinated seawater. Overall, results highlight the economic and social tradeoffs among these different policy choices and the challenges facing the implementation of sustainable groundwater management in Tunisia. More specifically, results show the advantages of using subsidized desalinated seawater compared to the other two policy alternatives in terms of the value of agricultural production, farmers’ profits, and employment, despite of its sizeable budgetary burden. © 2018, Bononia University Press.

I draw from critical development and science and technology studies and highlight that this imagery has been actively performed. Insiders elaborated a compelling narrative calling upon a will to improve through technology and the moral legitimacy of social entrepreneurship in development; they worked hard to establish a supportive coalition in an ever wider network. This story hinges on several assumptions, which upon closer scrutiny appear to be problematic: the unicity of smallholder farming, the attribution of inherent technical characteristics to a specific object-the "drip kit"-regardless of the context in which it is used, and the framing of social entrepreneurship and market-based approaches as alternative models even though these rather constitute a re-working of existing arrangements within the international development community. Nonetheless, the pro-poor and environmentally friendly smallholder drip irrigation narrative still continues to be successful in harnessing the support of the international development community, despite the little capacity drip irrigation has had to transform smallholder farming, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Unpacking the origins, actors, and building blocks of the discursive success of smallholder drip irrigation provides fresh perspectives on the practices of development in the sector and is the first step toward more meaningful engagement with smallholder farmers in the developing world. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article highlights the link between low-quality water and food crops irrigation. A cross-sectional research was conducted to assess factors motivating farmers to use low-quality water from the waste stabilisation ponds for food crops irrigation in urban and peri-urban areas in Morogoro Urban and Mvomero, in Morogoro Region, Tanzania, from October 2013 to March 2015. Data were collected through farmers’ survey (n = 80), in-depth interviews with key informants (n = 7) and focus group discussions (n = 4). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in results presentation. The findings indicated alternative way of earning income during dry seasons, lack of alternative sources of irrigation water, alternative source of employment, the need to produce food, land availability near the low-quality water, plant nutrients in the water and limited awareness of the health problems associated with low-quality water irrigation as incentives for farmers to irrigate food crops using low-quality water. The results further showed that farming using low-quality water has been their livelihood strategy; farmers meet their family needs such as school fees, health and food by using the income generated from the sale of vegetables and paddy. Regardless of all these benefits, the existing use of low-quality water in farming activities is informal. Besides, there are no regulations guiding its use with no declaration to whether the resource is suitable for food crops irrigation. However, banning the practice on the ground of health risks might be devastating to farmers. This practice should therefore be regulated in such a way that low-quality water disposed from the ponds is considered as a potential source of water for food crops irrigation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Vietnamese rice production has achieved remarkable success over the last couple of decades. This is due to land and market reforms, known as ‘Doi Moi’. There were noticeable changes in policies, such as land and production systems, which were transformed from a collective to an individual contract system in the 1980s. Vietnam made progress in rice production through the legalisation of the privatisation of farm properties and a huge investment in irrigation systems. The country not only ensured its domestic demand, but also started exporting rice and gradually became the second largest exporter in the world. An estimate of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution function (CES) for Vietnam’s rice production is essential for the government to design effective policy on agricultural production. This study makes the first attempt to estimate the nested CES model for Vietnamese rice production in 2012. The paper finds that the elasticity of substitution of Vietnam's nested CES model lies between 0.44 and 0.46. The results indicate the weak substitutability between land and the capital-labour composite in the nested CES model. This also suggests that it is impossible to take labour as the substitutable factor for land and capital. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {While many studies have employed stated preferences methods to estimate the value of non-market ecosystem goods and services, contingent valuation (CV) still generates a significant amount of criticism. Besides ethical concerns, two of the key criticisms relate to insensitivity to scope and order effects. We examine the expectation that the presence of order effects in stepwise disclosure procedures affects the degree of scope sensitivity. We use data from a CV exercise asking farmers in Southern Spain to value two different levels of guarantee of water supply for irrigation in a context of water scarcity. We find that despite order effects being present, they do not affect the existence or the degree of sensitivity to scope. We conclude that, in the light of the mixed evidence found in the literature and the results of our study, it does not seem justified to ascribe order effects and their connection with sensitivity to scope to study design alone (e.g. step-wise versus advanced disclosure, top-down versus bottom-up). The nature of the environmental good under valuation also matters. Our study of irrigation water as a common-pool resource suggests that, when clear private benefits also exist, these appear to override any 'good cause dumping effect' that might arise from the public good component. © 2015 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity at an alarming rate has been a limiting factor for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid environments of the world. It has resulted in a number of problems such as poverty and food insecurity among farm households. Therefore, building and improving resilience, as a way to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity, is important for farm households. But one of the significant steps for planning to improve farm households’ resilience under water scarcity is investigation of the current level of resilience of these households and understanding their variances. Therefore, this study offers a classification of farm households’ diversity based on resilience. Primary data were collected from 260 randomly selected farm households in 21 villages around Parishan wetland, Iran. Farm Household Resilience Scale was used to measure resilience. Cluster analysis suggested three groups: highly, medium-, and low-resilient farm households. The results of comparing three groups revealed that highly resilient farm households characterize with higher risk management, more agricultural water security, more positive psychological traits, and better knowledge management. Also, they had better water quality, attended more agricultural extension activities, and used modern irrigation systems. Farm households’ resilience map using GIS software illustrated that there is a relationship between resilience and farm location from the wetland. The findings of this study could be used by planner and policy-makers to improve farm households’ resilience in arid and semi-arid environments. Improvement in knowledge management system is recommended as one of the most effective policy instruments in building resilience. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This research uses a unique dataset that combines actual household consumption data and county assessor's data of house market value and characteristics with a survey of household conservation adoption of indoor and outdoor water conservation methods. Increased education, age, and income all were found to positively affect indoor and outdoor conservation adoption. Surprisingly neither higher summer consumption during severe drought, nor the perception of prolonged drought increased outdoor conservation adoption, but owning previously conserving Bermuda lawn did increase adoption. However, indoor adoption was higher for homeowners and those who expected prolonged drought. Results suggest that incentives should be targeted at low and average income homeowners and that education regarding the benefits of outdoor conservation should be targeted at all homeowners regarding the higher marginal benefit of seasonal reductions in outdoor watering. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Using a nationally representative panel dataset, this paper empirically estimates the profitability of fertilizer use for maize production in Nigeria. We find that fertilizer use in Nigeria is not as low as conventional wisdom suggests. Low marginal physical product and high transportation costs significantly reduce the profitability of fertilizer use. Apart from reduced transportation costs, other constraints such as soil quality, timely access to the product, and availability of complementary inputs such as improved seeds, irrigation and credit, as well as good management practices are also necessary for sustained agricultural productivity improvements. © 2016},

	abstract = {In this paper we provide an overview of recent trends in the availability and quality of land and water resources in rural China, and examine the common presumption that rural resources are rapidly degrading in China. Data based on consistent definitions and measurement methods that have recently become available are used to that end. In addition, we analyse the impact of new policy initiatives to introduce market-based instruments and new institutions to address land degradation and water scarcity problems.We find that the decline in cultivated area has accelerated in the beginning of the new century. Ecological recovery programs, not urbanization and industrialization, are the major factors causing this decline. Ecological recovery programs are also a major force behind the increase in forest land area and the reduction of water erosion. Modest successes can be observed in the protection of wetlands and (until the mid-1980s) for the average quality of cultivated land. On the other hand, degradation of natural grassland and wind erosion have become much more severe in recent decades.In northern China, particularly in the 3-H (Hai and Luan, Huai and Huang) river basins, the availability of water has tightened. Groundwater tables have fallen considerably in the Hai river basin, because farmers increasingly rely on groundwater for irrigation. Evidence on other parts of northern China is mixed. Pollution of surface water is getting worse since the beginning of the 1990s in two major lakes in southern China and until recently in the rivers in northern China. Water quality problems in the larger rivers in southern China are less severe and getting less. These problems are to a large extent caused by agriculture-based non-point source pollution, especially in the major lakes and reservoirs.The sloping land conversion program, water pricing, and the establishment of water user associations and payments for environmental service projects are used as cases to examine the introduction of market-based instruments and new institutions. We argue that less government interference in the implementation of these instruments and institutions is likely to enhance ecological as well the economic benefits. Moreover, supportive measures to improve the functioning of land and labor markets are usually needed to ensure the sustainability of the impact of interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The collective output (water) is distributed according to some allocation rule and used by each farmer in combination with land to produce a final good. The analysis shows that the initial degree of inequality affects the allocation rule that maximises the amount of water collectively provided. Specifically, two forces act in opposite directions. The first 'effort-augmenting' force pushes the distribution of water towards the agent with the higher return to water in the attempt to maximise the aggregate level of effort. This is the prominent force when efforts are highly substitute. If efforts display some degree of complementarity, the effort mix, alongside with aggregate effort, becomes important. A second 'effort-mix' force then emerges, that favours more egalitarian or even progressive water allocation rules. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..},

We find that public irrigations do not increase in response to a warmer climate, but private irrigations do. On the other hand, we find that public irrigation schemes are provided primarily as a response to water scarcity. Moreover, we find that private irrigations are taken gradually while public irrigations are provided as a lump sum, resulting in either too much or too little provision. Therefore, public adaptations to climate change will likely involve two inefficiencies. No provision of irrigation in a hotter climate may result from a lack of knowledge. Overprovision of irrigation in dry zones may result from a lump-sum provision of a public good. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Accounting should mobilise growing awareness of environmental degradation into harm mitigation strategies by representing humanity's relational existence with nature. Catchment-oriented accounting directs attention to the harm inflicted by unsustainable practices by integrating measurements of the multiple causes of degradation into meaningful accounts. We propose a semi-qualitative risk matrix to enhance stakeholder participation in the construction of these accounts: our matrix allows lay-stakeholders to use their lived experiences to socialise expert measurements, and thus embark on a journey of learning socially about sustainable living. An irrigation case-study is used to evaluate the extent to which irrigators displayed the following social learning capacities through their contribution to the construction of risk accounts on the impact of irrigation on their catchment: awareness of each other's competing-and-interdependent goals and perspectives, shared problem identification, appreciation of the complex issues at hand, motivation to work collaboratively, trust and the creation of formal-informal relationships. Four of seven irrigators displayed many of these capacities as they contested unsustainable values embedded in conventional irrigation discourse, and articulated less harmful priorities. The remaining irrigators took advantage of the analytical-deliberative spaces (provided by our matrix and accounts) to better appreciate the environmental impact of irrigation. © 2013 .},

	abstract = {This paper recommends a revision of watershed development policy in India in relation to the planning of development interventions involving agricultural intensification and rainwater harvesting following biophysical and societal impact studies carried out on two watershed development projects in Karnataka. A need for changes in policy has arisen in response to progressive catchments closure at the basin level and declining volumes of water flowing into village level reservoirs (known locally as tanks). Flow reductions have occurred largely as a result of increased agricultural intensification over the past 10-15 years. Field levelling, field bund construction, soil water conservation measures, farm ponds, the increase in areas under horticulture and forestry and the increased abstraction and use of groundwater for irrigation are all contributing factors to reduced flows. Planning methodologies and approaches, which may have been appropriate 20 years ago for planning water harvesting within watershed development projects, are no longer appropriate today. New planning approaches are required which (1) take account of these changed flow conditions and (2) are also able to take account of externalities, which occur when actions of some affect the livelihoods of others who have no control or influence over such activities and which (3) contribute to the maintenance of agreed minimum downstream flows for environmental and other purposes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a programming model for farm-level land-use changes and output supply response to estimate the effects of agricultural land tax in South Africa. The modeling approach is based on baseline statistics from a descriptive analysis. Findings - The results indicate that changes in land use and output supply response are marginal. The highest effects are observed on irrigated areas of sunflower seed (0.23 percent) and wheat (0.17 percent). This results to declines in supply of 0.07 percent for sunflower seeds; 0.06 percent for wheat; 0.04 percent for soya beans; 0.03 percent for each of white maize and sorghum; and 0.02 percent for yellow maize production. Therefore, levying a land tax may discourage investment on irrigation facilities and consequently irrigated farming. Originality/value - The programming modeling approach captures the significant differences in the farm characteristics and the overarching profit-maximizing behaviour of farmers, which an econometric approach may not easily capture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the biosaline agriculture concept is bringing life to unproductive lands by cultivating salt-tolerant crops, trees and fodder grass that are nourished by saline water. Over the past several decades, the biosaline agriculture concept has been gaining in understanding. Although technical progress has been made in the use of saline ground and surface water for agricultural production of salt-tolerant plants, the transfer from science to larger scale practice still is not enough in several countries. Biosaline technology transfer to agriculture has had some success where it has been demonstrated under farm and local conditions. Nuclear techniques play a critical role in determining the long-term effects and sustainability of the biosaline agriculture concept. Introduction of plants require that irrigation be managed to suit the plants' needs to avoid accumulation of salts in the upper soil. Several nuclear techniques are used in this approach. In 1997, the IAEA launched the interregional project INT/5/144 "Sustainable Utilization of Saline Groundwater and Wastelands for Plant Production" in nine countries: Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan and United Arab Emirates. The main achievement of the project was to demonstrate that it was possible to grow economically useful salt-tolerant plants using saline groundwater in wastelands. In all participating countries about 63 plant species have grown in several demonstration sites using very low inputs. In most cases it has simply been plantation of the species and irrigating with saline groundwater without any other input, including fertiliser since most of the woody species chosen are nitrogen fixing. The initial feasibility and low cost of the technology has been established. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Contrary to Asian countries, the agricultural sector in Africa has not benefited from the green revolution success. After a long time of disinterest in the agriculture sector in Africa, several voices arise now in favour of greater efforts towards this sector. Several studies tend to show the crucial role of agriculture in African countries' growth and highlight the huge need of increasing the productivity in this sector. If an increase in agriculture productivity requires both an expansion of irrigated areas and the adoption of high-yield varieties, those innovations and their high development could be the source of negative health (and environmental) effects. Using a mega-analysis, this paper highlights first the links between health, disease and development and then agricultural productivity. The literature review shows that the negative effect of bad health was not systematically checked, and that the intensity of this effect depends on disease and also on the work productivity and the existence or not of a coping process. The second part of the paper focuses on the development of high-intensive agriculture as a risk factor for farmers' and rural inhabitants' health. This survey shows that whether irrigation and fertiliser and pest intensive use could be considered highly health (and environmental) risk factors, and appropriate control measures (such as systematic maintenance of irrigation canals, alternate wetting and drying of irrigated fields or integrated pest management) considerably reduce this risk, while at the same time, increase the agriculture productivity. © The author 2010.

We use a population data set of irrigation wells in the Nebraska portion of the Republican River Basin to analyze whether adopting spatially differentiated groundwater pumping regulations leads to significant reductions in farmer abatement costs and costs from damage to streams. We find that regulators can generate most of the potential savings in total social costs without accounting for spatial heterogeneity.

In the vast, poverty-stricken Indo-Gangetic basin, however, high surrogate water price is driving out small-holder irrigation. With rising diesel prices, most small-holders who use borewells for irrigation find effective water use cost soaring, obliging them to economize on water use even by quitting irrigated farming. Electrified borewell owners, far fewer, face low marginal cost but have to contend with stringent electricity rationing. Public irrigation systems grossly under-price irrigation, but these are getting marginalized despite massive government and donor investments. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This helps account for substantial spillover effects of the tenancy reform on non-tenant farms noted in an earlier study.

	abstract = {The release of the Guide to the Proposed Murray–Darling Basin Plan created considerable angst, with vocal dissent expressed at meetings in rural centres. Irrigation lobbyists raised especially strenuous objections to the Guide claiming the cuts to water availability would be too severe and the flow on effects to the wider community depicted as calamitous. Arguably, the response by those promoting reform has been relatively muted and given the historical strength and political awareness of irrigation and farmer groups, their criticisms were not at all surprising. Arguably, reformists appear to have been taken by surprise and stymied in the communication of counter arguments, apparently relying exclusively on the potency of the scientific evidence. In this paper, we seek to explore this issue by focussing on the role of irrigation lobbyists and reformists during this latest phase of water policy development. We specifically employ the typology of rhetorical argumentation developed by Hirschman (1991) and endeavour to trace the line of argumentation against this framework. We conclude that the debate witnessed to date has followed relatively predictable patterns and call for greater scrutiny of the motives behind the rhetoric. © 2011 The Economic Society of Australia},

The focus is on the design, evaluation and comparison of irrigation management alternatives in a participatory setting, encouraging direct involvement of actors throughout the whole process. A framework for participatory MCA was developed that integrates preparatory interviews (actors selection, understanding the decision context), workshops (alternatives and criteria identification, results discussion) and a second round of interviews (criteria weighting and alternatives evaluation). This framework combines elements from the analytical hierarchy process with social multi-criteria evaluation. The use of different participatory techniques is essential for enabling continuous participation and ensuring that different points of view are taken into account in the evaluation process. The results obtained allowed the identification and comparison of the most preferred alternatives and the analysis of the positions of the different actor groups. Social learning was an important outcome: participants acknowledged that they have gained an improved understanding of the problem and of each other's viewpoints. The direct engagement of actors in MCA presents two challenges: actors' challenge, related to the participation in the process itself, and analytical challenge, mostly related to the interpretation of the results. © 2011 Earthscan, Taylor & Francis Group.},

The results reveal a resource use inefficiency of 19[%] on average under VRS assumption and of 31[%] under CRS assumption. Hence, there is considerable scope for progress. In order to explain the variability of the technical efficiency scores, the estimation of the Tobit model, shows that the growers&#39; age, the land tenure, the water source and the irrigation system are some determinants which have to be taken into account when providing guidance for policy measures aimed at improving the farms&#39; technical performance.},

Design/methodology/approach - Data from a survey held in 2008 and 2010 among 259 households in Minle County, Gansu province, covering the years 2007 and 2009, are used to estimate the factors affecting land levelling investments, irrigation canal investments and perceived land tenure security. The authors use the 2SCML technique and the IVLS method to estimate a selection model and a non-limited regression model, respectively, and use IVP methods to examine the robustness of the results. Findings - The authors' results indicate that perceived land tenure security significantly affects self-governed investments but does not affect individual investments in land quality improvements. In particular, the authors find that households that consider land certificates as important for protecting land rights invest significantly more in irrigation canals construction and maintenance. The authors' results further provide evidence that individual investments in land quality improvement contribute to higher perceived land tenure security. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the available literature on the relationship between land tenure security and land investments by examining the role of perceived (instead of formal) land tenure security and by making a distinction between individual household investments and self-governed land investments.

But valuation and BCA have also attracted criticisms. 'Internal' criticisms point to the absence of alternative scenarios in valuation, overlooking of ecological trade-offs and dis-services, and inattention to context. Others criticize aggregation across diverse stakeholders and the problem of non-monetizable benefits, and dismiss BCA as fatally flawed. They suggest approaches such as deliberative decision-making and multi-criteria analysis. We propose a middle path that uses the strengths of economic analysis for decision support while avoiding the pitfalls. We disaggregate economic impacts by stakeholder groups, link ecosystem changes to benefits as well as dis-benefits, and examine how socio-technological context shapes the magnitude of economic impact. We illustrate this approach by studying the impact of creating the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple wildlife sanctuary in the Western Ghats forests of southern India. Our analysis shows that while some stakeholders are net beneficiaries, others are net losers. Changes in forest rights, irrigation technologies, and ecosystem dynamics influence the magnitude of benefits and sometimes convert gainers into losers. Such disaggregated analysis can provide useful information for deliberative decision-making and important academic insights on how economic value is generated. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Changing water demands induced through climate change and a growing biofuel energy sector throughout the western States are expected to increase pressures on the present allocation mechanisms for an increasingly scarce resource, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the West. In this paper, we first present the policy motivation for examining continued producer adoption of water conserving irrigation production systems as a foundation for providing a sustainable future for western irrigated agriculture. Second, we summarize the historical transitions that help to define the adjustment path to increased sustainability for the sector. While western irrigated agriculture is on a path toward greater sustainability, evidence suggests that the sustainability goal has not been fully attained. Third, we develop a new conceptual framework for groundwater management that endogenizes both per acre applied water and an acreage-based technology adoption relationship within a normative, dynamic-optimization model for groundwater irrigated agriculture. The framework models producer adoption decisions under uncertainty while accounting for the influence of irrigation technology as a quasi-fixed input, i.e., the influence of asset fixity on producer adoption decisions. In this model, total crop production is based on consumptive use of irrigation water while the cost side is based on total applied water. © 2010 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

The present study examines some aspect of its application focussing on Mediterranean irrigation area where frequent water shortages may generate significant income reductions in the current climate conditions, and may be further exacerbated by climate change. This enhanced loss of income in the future would occur due to a change in climate variability. This change would appreciably reduce the probability of weather conditions that are favourable for irrigation, but would not significantly increase either the probability of unfavourable weather conditions or the magnitude of their impact. As the IST and other insurance tools that protect against adversity and catastrophic events are only activated under extreme conditions, farmers may not consider them to be suitable in dealing with the new climate regime. This would leave a portion of the financial resources allocated by the RDP unused, resulting in less support for climate change adaptation.},

The model incorporates, in one endogenous system, the economic, physical and biological relationships in the water-soil-plant-environment system and its objective is to maximise the regional social welfare. The model determines the optimal crop mix and the optimal allocation of the limited water and land resources among all potential users. Then, different allocation approaches from the concept of transferable utility games are applied to determine a reasonable and fair allocation of the additional net benefits which will be acceptable to all the players.

	abstract = {Through the case of integrated agriculture-aquaculture in rural Malawi, this paper argues that hybrid research can reveal new interactions in social-ecological systems not evident when studies by social or natural methods independently. While recent research acknowledges the social and natural dimensions of aquaculture systems, studies often create an artificial divide by attempting to address each aspect in isolation. Social science research has overlooked the biophysical aspects of aquaculture, while scientific research has uncritically accepted orthodox explanations of environmental outcomes without addressing the social contexts of such systems. The social component of this research reveals that fish farmers in Malawi are rejecting practices which do not work in the local context (fertilization with pond mud) and adopting strategies that do work (irrigation with pond water). The physical component of this research compliments the social by elucidating that irrigation with pond water resulted in higher soil nutrient and moisture content. The paper concludes that small-scale aquaculture can make significant contributions to rural household food and income security in Africa and that hybrid research methods can improve our abilities to investigate the complex, connected nature of social-ecological systems. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Therefore, national efforts to study the reduction of water withdrawal and consumption in existing and future plants have been intensified.Water consumption in these plants is strongly associated with the dry bulb temperature and humidity of air. There is significant variability in these parameters. In this work, we characterized the uncertainty and variability in these parameters in terms of probability distributions. These distributions change with seasons.We obtained optimal operating conditions for each season in the face of uncertainties using water minimization as the objective. It has been found that the water consumption is reduced from 3.2 to 15.4% depending on the season. In order to solve this large scale real world optimization problem, we had to resort to an efficient stochastic nonlinear programming (SNLP) algorithm called Better Optimization of Nonlinear Uncertain Systems (BONUS).

The Yaqui River begins near the U.S.-Mexico border and continues for 400 km before reaching the Oviachic dam, but has not reached the nearby Gulf of California for decades due to diversions for irrigation. These diversions have degraded the riparian ecosystem, coastal wetlands, and estuaries. Environmental services provided by restored flows in the Yaqui River would include healthy riverside vegetation, wetlands and estuaries, fish and wildlife habitats, non-use values, and recreation. A contingent valuation survey in 40 neighborhoods in the most populated Delta city, Ciudad Obregon, was administered to estimate non-market values of instream uses. Respondents were given a current and hypothetical Delta scenario (the latter assumed restored water flows in the River) and asked a willingness-to-pay (WTP) question regarding purchasing water for environmental flows through higher water bills. Results from 148 in-person interviews indicated that households would pay an average of 73 pesos monthly. WTP was found related to key variables suggested by economic theory and contingent valuation studies elsewhere: income, educational level, number of children in the household, and initial bid amount. These results will allow decision makers to compare the benefits generated by different water uses, including environmental services, and to manage scarce water resources under a long-term sustainable approach. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It estimates rice crop WP for 21 Bangladesh districts for 37. years; explores WP variations among districts; and investigates causality involving WP, intensification and technological variables; and groundwater irrigation and depth. It breaks new grounds by probing these significant but unexplored issues.Technological diffusion was the key factor explaining inter-district WP differences. The impact of agricultural intensification on rabi (dry season) and kharif (wet season) crop WPs was positive and negative respectively. Dummy variables typifying policy transition negatively impacted on WPs for both kharif and overall crops. While rabi and kharif rice WPs grew with time, overall crop WP recorded the strongest growth. Rabi and overall WPs were lower in salinity- and drought-prone districts covering 33% of Bangladesh's net cropped area (NCA).In 90% of Bangladesh's NCA districts, technological diffusion caused WP. Causality existed between groundwater irrigation and depth in 60% NCA. Despite significant potential to increase WP, increasing dependence on groundwater appears unsustainable. Widespread diffusion of HYVs in the kharif season, and development of salinity and drought-tolerant rice varieties could go a long way in sustaining rice WP. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household's savings behavior and informal insurance network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to have substantial effects on irrigated agriculture. Extreme climate events, such as droughts, are likely to become more common. These patterns are evident in median projections of climate change for the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Understanding climate change effects on returns from irrigation involves explicit representation of spatial changes in natural stocks (i.e., water supply) and their temporal variability (i.e., frequency of drought states of nature) and the active management responses to capital stocks represented by mitigation and alternative adaptation strategies by state of nature. A change in the frequency of drought will induce a change in the allocation of land and water between productive activities. In this paper, a simulation model of state-contingent production is used to analyze the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In the absence of mitigation, climate change will have severe adverse effects on irrigated agriculture in the Basin. However, a combination of climate mitigation and adaptation through changes in land and water use will allow the maintenance of agricultural water use and environmental flows. © 2010 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {The Sultan Marshes in the Develi Basin, Anatolia, one of twelve internationally important wetlands of Turkey, have been severely affected by the construction of an irrigation project in 1988. Intensive use of surface and ground water in irrigation has caused more than a 1 m decline in water levels and has affected the wetlands' ecological characteristics. Previous studies indicate that Sultan Marshes will need more water to restore viable ecological conditions. In this study, we analyze how economic benefits from agriculture and wetlands would be affected if moderate amounts of water were diverted from agriculture back to wetlands in the Develi Basin. By estimating total and marginal costs and benefits associated with water diversions, we determined the optimum or economically-efficient amount of water diversion. When only direct-use values of the wetland (animal grazing, plant harvesting, and ecotourism) were included in the analysis, the optimum amount of water diversion to the wetlands was found to be 5.2 million m3 year- 1 (165 L sec- 1), which compares to about 62 million m3 year- 1 (1,957 L sec- 1) used in irrigation. When wastewater treatment benefits (an indirect-use value) were added, the optimum amount rose to 7 million m3 year- 1. Overall, the analysis showed that water diversion from agriculture to the Sultan Marshes is economically preferable. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our data show that, although the potential is high, the insufficient supply of irrigation water, excessively expensive chemical fertilizer, and moderately costly labor hinder the scheme from achieving that potential. First of all, an improvement in irrigation is crucial as it increases yield not only directly but also indirectly through its complementary relationship to chemical fertilizer. We also find that an improvement in credit access is important as it can increase the application of chemical fertilizer and labor by making the acquisition of these expensive inputs through markets possible. The unavailability of hired and exchange labor during peak seasons is another constraint to the intensive use of labor. The introduction of rice varieties with a shorter maturity duration would relax the timing of transplanting and thus spread out the peak seasons' labor demand. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper charts the performance of the agriculture sector in Malawi for the period 2000-2013 (with particular attention paid to the last three to four years of the said period). In the quest to attain this aim the paper empirically focuses on the significance of mapping the performance of the sector in the form of trends against the baseline sectoral performance targets enlisted in the ASWAP, CAADP Framework and SADC RISDP. The consistent and concerted efforts by the Government of Malawi and development partners to meet the ASWAP, CAADP framework and SADC RISDP targets have resulted in the country making commendable economic growth and poverty alleviation. The country has been able to attain the 6% agricultural growth target despite the questionable quality of public expenditure. It is also interesting to note that changes in the agriculture sector appear to have had influence on incomes, poverty and malnourishment. The trend analysis led to the following findings; the growth in agricultural GDP and the annual GDP growth of the country surpassed the CAADP target of 6% annual growth and this culminated to an increase in production (cereal and livestock production) and productivity (land productivity) despite the fact that the country has not met the irrigation and fertiliser used targets. This increase in production and productivity may be earnestly attributed substantially public invested in the agriculture sector to meet the CAADP 10% target of the total budget to agriculture. However, this increase in agricultural GDP annual growth has not had a significant bearing on the country's battle to offset poverty; the country's GHI is still serious and the proportion of the population below the minimum dietary energy consumption is still high (23% on average) whilst the MDG I target stands at 20%. The major deduction from these findings is that there is a need for more concerted efforts in Malawi to refine agricultural growth investments; this can be carried out efficiently by developing a National Agriculture Plan (NAP) which will be a single policy tool that will guide investment and implementation of priorities in the sector.},

	abstract = {The potential for improving irrigation scheduling decisions and adoption of more efficient irrigation systems is explored using a bioeconomic simulation model of lettuce production on the Gnangara Mound near Perth, Western Australia. Sandy soils with poor water and nutrient holding capacity are associated with declining marginal productivity of water at high water use, which would create an incentive to reduce water use and to adopt closer sprinkler spacing if farmers had correct information about the declining marginal productivity of water. Incorrect perceptions regarding water-yield relationships lead to over use of water by up to 50 per cent and reduce profits by 475 per crop hectare (12 per cent) in the short run, and remove the incentive to adopt more efficient systems in the long run. Higher water prices create an incentive to reduce irrigation scheduling time in the short term and to adopt more uniform sprinkler systems, and tend to reduce the discrepancies associated with poor information about the marginal productivity of water. The low level of adoption of efficient irrigation systems in the region might be explained partly by historically poor water governance and insufficient extension regarding water productivity and technology. © 2007 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2007 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc. and Blackwell Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Sardar Sarovar Dam reached a height of 121.92 m in 2006 and at this height the dam has enough water to generate most of the promised benefits - irrigation, drinking water, and electricity. However, currently only 30% of the targeted villages receive regular water supplies, less than 20% of the canal network has been constructed and power generation remains well below the generation capacity reached. Even as the dam construction nears completion, rehabilitation of several thousand families is poor or incomplete. This, for a project that has had clearly laid out legal mandates to alleviate human and environmental costs, and has been under continuous public scrutiny and Supreme Court monitoring. The performance of this project does not seem very different from other Indian major irrigation and power projects: while main civil works somehow get completed, infrastructure and efforts necessary to realise benefits of the projects remain incomplete. The experience of people displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Project is fairly consistent with the experiences of millions displaced by other projects across the country, wherein the State uses the colonial Land Acquisition Act to dispossess people from their homes, lands and livelihoods, and consistently refuses to create just resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements and accountability frameworks to enable restoration of their livelihoods and their dignity. Instead, it promotes cash compensation (often aggressively and violently) to make people give up their homes, villages, land and other natural resources.},

	abstract = {Nepalese mid-hill farmers have shifted from a subsistence-based farming system to an intensified farming system. This paper attempts to describe the evolution of the process of agricultural intensification in the mid-hill region by examining external drivers, trends in fertilizer use, landholding, cropping patterns, irrigation and labour use in the years 1989, 1999 and 2009. Data were obtained by means of structured interviews, focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations. The study revealed that modern technology and the involvement of NGOs have facilitated the agricultural intensification process in three ways: (i) by providing access to technology without any financial cost to the farmer, (ii) by increasing the variety and number of crops and encouraging farmers to discontinue crops that had pest problems and (iii) by maximizing the use of chemical fertilizers to increase production. Results showed a significant increase in the application of urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) and a decrease in the application of farm yard manure (FYM) and muriate of potash from 1989 to 2009 (p < 0.001). The average landholding of 0.76ha in 1989 was reduced to 0.63ha by 2009. The number of crops (rice, maize or millet) cultivated per year increased to at least three crops with the introduction of potatoes and spring rice; however, some crops such as sugarcane and tobacco were not continued as a result of pest problems. Increased nitrogen input could lead to increased N2O emissions; therefore, a better understanding of nitrogen fertilization and quantification of N2O emissions from intensified agriculture is urgently needed to assess the possible environmental impact of input intensification. © 2011 Earthscan.},

Survey results show that while many farmers noticed long-term changes in temperature and precipitation, most could not take remedial action. Lack of access to credit and water were cited as the main factors inhibiting adaptation. Common adaptation responses reported included diversifying crops, changing varieties and planting dates, using irrigation, and supplementing livestock feed. A multinomial logit analysis of climate adaptation responses suggests that access to water, credit, extension services and off-farm income and employment opportunities, tenure security, farmers' asset base and farming experience are key to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. This implies that appropriate government interventions to improve farmers' access to and the status of these factors are needed for reducing vulnerability of farmers to climate adversities in such arid areas. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {This article reports on an analysis of technical efficiency and environment-technology gaps in wheat farming in Iran. A random sample of 676 farmers was selected from the province of Kerman in 2004. In this study, Kerman is divided into five regions based on climatic and geographical conditions. The province is situated in the south-eastern part of Iran and contains substantial variations in climate. The technical efficiency indices are computed using three approaches. First, a standard stochastic production frontier was employed using pooled cross-sectional data. Secondly, regional stochastic frontier production functions were estimated. Lastly, the metafrontier approach was used because production environments and technologies are expected to differ between the five regions. Use of this method enabled technical efficiency scores to be corrected by the coefficient of the environment-technology gap ratio (ETGR). Estimates of the frontier were obtained assuming a translog functional form. Results indicate that farms differ in technical efficiencies, ETGRs and the use they make of inputs. Mean ETGRs vary substantially between farms and across regions whereas mean technical efficiencies are reasonably similar across regions but differ in the extent of variation among farms within each region. A low ETGR for the north-western region is attributable to a lack of water resources, restricting the ability of farmers to benefit from improved varieties, and small-sized farms, which militate against mechanization embodying labor-saving technologies. The results do not lead to definitive policy prescriptions. But they do provide indicators of where farm-level research is likely to be most effective in closing the environment-technology gap, for example by enabling farmers to take greater advantage of the productivity-enhancing effects of improved technologies embodied in cropping machinery and irrigation facilities. The ability of farmers to alleviate the environmental constraints on wheat production is likely to vary across regions, and will depend on the nature of these constraints and the ability of researchers to design technologies suited to each region that will overcome them. © 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

Groundwater now irrigates more than double the area irrigated by surface water. The alarming drop in groundwater tables in parts of Northwestern and of Peninsular India, and the apparent high public cost of subsidizing the electricity for ground water pumping, has led to calls for limiting groundwater abstraction and further developing surface water systems. This reaction to the ground water challenge misses the point. The debate should not be about whether surface water schemes are preferable to groundwater use, or more generally how to build new infrastructure to increase water supply. Instead, the question is how to deliver a reliable service to improve agricultural productivity. Further surface water development (reservoirs, canals) will not reduce demand for ground water unless it can meet the requirement for “just-in-time” water without discriminating against tail-enders and/or small farmers. © 2012, © 2012 Emerging Markets Forum.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes Colorado corn producers' preferences over both private- and environmental public-good production system attributes, and tests the robustness of alternative data reconstruction and estimation techniques. Irrigated corn production practices are characterized by intensive water and chemical use, resulting in nonpoint source pollution to water bodies as well as soil erosion problems. Data from a stated preference survey are employed to analyze key attributes of experimentally configured irrigation systems, proposed as alternatives to current practices. Panel mixed logit estimations (and several alternative fixed parameter specifications) uncover consistently positive preferences for profit, risk reduction, and, importantly, systems with less environmental impact in terms of nitrate leaching and soil erosion. The analysis also finds evidence of preference heterogeneity and a complementary relationship between the two environmental attributes. Analysis of this kind can be used by policy makers to predict behavioral responses associated with introduction of new technologies, or to assess welfare implications of agricultural policy changes and stricter environmental regulations. Dans le présent article, nous avons analysé les préférences des producteurs de maïs du Colorado concernant les attributs des systèmes de production de biens environnementaux publics et privés et avons vérifié la robustesse des techniques de rechange pour la reconstruction et l'estimation des données. Les pratiques de production de maïs irrigué sont caractérisées par l'utilisation intensive d'eau et de produits chimiques qui entraîne une pollution diffuse des plans d'eau ainsi que des problèmes d'érosion du sol. Nous avons utilisé des données tirées d'un sondage sur les préférences déclarées pour analyser les principaux attributs des systèmes d'irrigation expérimentaux proposés comme solutions de rechange aux pratiques actuelles. Les estimations du modèle mixte logit (et plusieurs spécifications de paramètres fixes) ont permis de découvrir des préférences uniformément positives concernant les profits, la réduction des risques et les systèmes ayant moins d'impact environnemental du point de vue du lessivage des nitrates et de l'érosion du sol. L'analyse a également montré l'hétérogénéité des préférences et l'existence d'un lien complémentaire entre les deux attributs environnementaux. Les décideurs pourraient utiliser ce genre d'analyse pour prévoir les réactions comportementales liées à l'introduction de nouvelles technologies ou pour évaluer les répercussions des changements de politique agricole et des règlements environnementaux plus stricts sur le bien-être. © 2010 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {Microbiological quality of the treated wastewater is an important parameter for its reuse. The data on the Fecal Coliform (FC) and Fecal Streptococcus (FS) at different stages of treatment in the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in Delhi watershed is not available, therefore in the present study microbial profiling of STPs was carried out to assess the effluent quality for present and future reuse options. This study further evaluates the water quality profiles at different stages of treatment for l6 STPs in Delhi city. These STPs are based on conventional Activated Sludge Process (ASP), extended aeration, physical, chemical and biological treatment (BIOFORE), Trickling Filter and Oxidation Pond. The primary effluent quality produced from most of the STPs was suitable for Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT). Extended Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) as a result of low inflow to the STPs was responsible for high turbidity, COD and BOD5 removal. Conventional ASP based STPs achieved 1.66 log FC and 1.06 log FS removal. STPs with extended aeration treatment process produced better quality effluent with maximum 4 log order reduction in FC and FS levels. "Kondli" and "Nilothi" STPs employing ASP, produced better quality secondary effluent as compared to other STPs based on similar treatment process. Oxidation Pond based STPs showed better FC and FS removals, whereas good physiochemical quality was achieved during the first half of the treatment. Based upon physical, chemical and microbiological removal efficiencies, actual integrated efficiency (IEa) of each STP was determined to evaluate its suitability for reuse for irrigation purposes. Except "Mehrauli" and "Oxidation Pond", effluents from all other STPs require tertiary treatment for further reuse. Possible reuse options, depending upon the geographical location, proximity of facilities of potential users based on the beneficial uses, and sub-soil types, etc. for the Delhi city have been investigated, which include artificial groundwater recharge, aquaculture, horticulture and industrial uses such as floor washing, boiler feed, and cooling towers, etc. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

While the nutrients contained in the wastewater is considered as beneficial to agriculture, the contaminants present in it pose environmental and health risks. This paper examines the morbidity status, its determinants as well as the cost of illness for households living in the areas irrigated with wastewater in comparison with those using normal quality water. Primary data collected from six villages irrigated with wastewater along Musi River which is fed with wastewater and one control village where normal quality water is used for irrigation has been used for the analysis. It is seen that higher rates of morbidity exist in the wastewater irrigated villages when compared to the control village. Specifically, adult and female morbidity rates are significantly higher than child and male morbidity rates. From the logit analysis it is seen that exposure to wastewater and engagement in activities based on it places the households in higher risk groups to report morbidity. Small and marginal farmers incur higher economic cost of illness. However, it has been difficult to ascertain the cause and effect relationship as most of the households have reported more common illnesses like fever, head ache, skin itching, stomach ailments, etc. The study points out the need for a comprehensive risk assessment and adoption of risk management measures including setting standards for treatment and discharge of wastewater and regulations on the type of uses etc. to prevent unplanned use of untreated or partially treated wastewater while taking into account local conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper assesses the potential loss of irrigation benefits in reallocating water from irrigation to meet requirements for environmental flows (e-flows) in the Upper Ganga Basin (UGB) in northern India. The minimum requirement for e-flows in the UGB is 32 billion cubic meters (BCM), or 42 % of the mean annual runoff. The current runoff during the low-flow months falls below the minimum requirement for e-flows by 5. 1 BCM. Depending on irrigation efficiency, reallocation of 41-51 % of the water from canal irrigation withdrawals can meet this deficit in minimum e-flows. The marginal productivity of canal irrigation consumptive water use (CWU), estimated from a panel regression with data from 32 districts from 1991 to 2004, assesses the potential loss of benefits in diverting water away from crop production. In the UGB, canal irrigation contributes to only 8 % of the total CWU of 56 BCM, and the marginal productivity of canal irrigation CWU across districts is also very low, with a median of 0. 03 USD/m3. Therefore, at present, the loss of benefits is only 1. 2-1. 6 % of the gross value of crop production. This loss of benefits can be overcome with an increase in irrigation efficiency or marginal productivity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {In modern living, rapid development has created an increase in demand for groundwater. An endeavor has been made to understand the hydrogeochemical parameters to determine the utility of groundwater. This situation is severe in coastal hard rock aquifers due to the influence of salinity ingression and other anthropogenic influence. A total of 135 groundwater samples were collected from the coastal aquifer of the Tuticorin district and analyzed for major cations and anions during premonsoon (PRM) and postmonsoon (POM). The ions analyzed were used to determine the drinking, agricultural and domestic utility of groundwater. The electrical conductivity (EC) contour shows that the groundwater quality is poor along the coast. The parameters were compared with WHO (Guidelines for drinking water quality recommendations, WHO, Geneva, 2004) standard for drinking purpose. A groundwater classification method has been developed for groundwater in the area using a dynamic water quality index (WQI). On the basis of the WQI so computed, groundwater in the area has been spatially classified into "excellent," "good," "poor" and "very poor" to "Unsuitable" water types variation lithologywise. Corrosivity ratio and hardness were noted to be higher and found to be unsuitable in majority of the regions for domestic purpose. Higher fluoride concentration was noted in the central part of the study area represented by complex geology comprising of the hornblende biotite gneiss and charnockite. Sodium percentage (Na%), sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, Wilcox (Classification and use of irrigation waters, US Department of Agriculture, Washington, 1955), permeability index, residual sodium bicarbonate, magnesium hazard, Kelly's ratio and potential salinity also indicate that most of the groundwater samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan African countries are being strongly urged to enhance their rice production, because their rice consumption and importation rates have been rapidly increasing in recent years. Areas planted to rice in Africa are classified agro-ecologically into rainfed upland, rainfed lowland, and irrigated. Rainfed lowland includes extensive areas of unexploited land that has great potential for the promotion of rice growing. For the unexploited rainfed lowlands of Ghana, we have been studying the development of low-cost rice-farming systems that require no large-scale irrigation or land reclamation. For such systems, it is important to select suitable areas where water for rice farming can be obtained naturally; floodwaters offer promise for this purpose. Delineation and mapping of floodwater prone areas suitable for rice production is important for successful utilization of this land resource. Here, we propose a method of assessing flood probability from submergence frequency, as estimated from satellite imagery and geospatial data. ALOS/PALSAR images acquired in May, June, August, and September 2010 were used to classify land and water, and then a submerged-area map was produced. From the results, we were able to accurately detect non-submerged areas and submerged areas with water depths of at least 3 cm. The number of times classified into submerged area was defined as submergence frequency, and it was approximated by distance from reservoirs representing White Volta River, ponds, and swamps. In addition, flood extent derived from reservoirs was simulated using digital elevation model (DEM). Finally, a flood probability assessment map was produced by integration of the estimated submergence frequency and flood extent simulation. The results of a comparison of soil moisture data measured at 69 points in the field and the NDVIs computed by ALOS/AVNIR showed that areas with high potential for flooding retained high levels of soil moisture and were more likely to show less deterioration of vegetation in the dry season. The validation of these results confirmed the adequacy of the flood probability assessment method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the history of water governance in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia and the challenges now facing the region as a consequence of rapid growth and global warming. The paper seeks to examine the possible benefits that might accrue from applying a distributed, multilevel approach to water governance in this and other settings. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with over 100 fruit growers and ranchers and with ten water managers in the Okanagan Valley between 2005 and 2009 are conducted. Archival materials documenting the history of agriculture and irrigation in the valley are examined to provide historical depth to the study. An interdisciplinary review of theoretical literature on multilevel governance is conducted and also a comparative review of water governance systems in Canada and elsewhere. Findings - The evidence supports the conclusion that distributed, multilevel governance systems offer an effective means of managing water in diverse settings, and that they are preferable, for a variety of reasons, to top-down approaches that concentrate regulatory authority in state-level institutions. Practical implications - On a global scale, current water governance practices are proving inadequate to meet the challenges of increasing scarcity and competition. This paper describes a governance model that can be applied in many settings and which can help resolve conflict while facilitating sustainable management. Originality/value - This paper integrates empirical and theoretical material from a variety of disciplines and diverse physical settings to construct a model of water governance designed to facilitate the combined goals of ecological sustainability, affordability, and equitable access to water resources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The irrigation game was used to explore the provision and appropriation decisions under asymmetric or sequential appropriation, complemented by a voluntary contribution mechanism experiment which looks at provision decisions under symmetric appropriation. The overall results were consistent with the patterns of previous studies: the zero contribution hypotheses is rejected whereas the most effective institution to increase cooperation was face-to-face communication, although we find that communication works much more effectively in Colombia than in Kenya. We also find that the asymmetric appropriation did reduce cooperation, though the magnitude of the social loss and the effectiveness of alternative institutional options varied across sites. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2010.},

	abstract = {This article evaluates irrigated agriculture sector response and resultant economic impacts of climate change for a part of the Murray Darling Basin in Australia. A water balance model is used to predict reduced basin inflows for mild, moderate and severe climate change scenarios involving 1, 2 and 4°C warming, and predict 13, 38 and 63% reduced inflows. Impact on irrigated agricultural production and profitability are estimated with a mathematical programming model using a two-stage approach that simultaneously estimates short and long-run adjustments. The model accounts for a range of adaptive responses including: deficit irrigation, temporarily following of some areas, permanently reducing the irrigated area and changing the mix of crops. The results suggest that relatively low cost adaptation strategies are available for a moderate reduction in water availability and thus costs of such a reduction are likely to be relatively small. In more severe climate change scenarios greater costs are estimated. Adaptations predicted include a reduction in total area irrigated and investments in efficient irrigation. A shift away from perennial to annual crops is also predicted as the latter can be managed more profitably when water allocations in some years are very low. © 2009 The Author Journal compilation © 2009 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc. and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

	abstract = {The bulk of the water productivity (WP) literature has focused on static cross-sectional analysis with inadequate attention given to long-term, time series analysis, either at the country level or at a lower level of aggregation (e.g.,district). The present study fills this gap by analyzing WP in Bangladesh using panel data of 21 districts over 37years (1968-2004) divided into three phases. It estimated levels of, and trends in, WPs of one irrigated rice (rabi) crop, and two mainly rain-fed (kharif) rice crops, with occasional supplementary irrigation. Also examined were WPs for rice crops in irrigated and rain-fed ecosystems. The findings indicated that WP levels in Bangladesh were significantly lower than that by global standards. Overall, WP growth rates varied significantly among districts and between phases with no consistent pattern emerging. On the whole, WPs trended upwards while differing widely among districts and between phases, seasons, ecosystems and areas differentiated by physiographic characteristics. The 1980s represented a period of stagnation. Drought-prone areas grew faster while salinity-prone areas grew slower vis-à-vis non-drought and non-saline areas. In the Ganges-dependent area, WP grew faster than that in the non-Ganges-dependent area. Rice production in Bangladesh represented a highly groundwater-dependent and fossil fuel-using process with significant environmental implications suggesting that WP growth may be unsustainable. Sustaining WP growth required a range of market and non-market-based policy options. © 2014 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.},

	abstract = {Irrigation can have a significant negative impact on the environment. Policies available to regulators to reduce the impact of irrigation include externality taxes and levies. In 2002 the Victorian Government introduced a system of salinity levies in the irrigation regions of Sunraysia, northern Victoria. These levies differ from typical taxes because they also introduce trade barriers between certain locations. These trade barriers may increase the cost of reducing salinity. We use experiments to compare the salinity levy with trade barriers to an alternative salinity tax which removes the trade barriers and replaces them with a tax that reflects the relative difference in cost of trading water between impact zones. Our experimental testbed results show that the salinity tax reduces the cost of salinity interception by the government by 75% as compared to the salinity levy. We observe water prices do not increase when regulation is introduced, this may be because the introduction of taxes and levies encourages buyers to act more aggressively preventing sellers from extracting surplus on trades. Further, the introduction of regulation does not increase variability in average outcomes for these markets. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We take the novel approach of expressing all benefits and costs of establishing plantations in terms of $ per gigalitre (GL) of water removed annually from river flows, setting upstream demands on the same basis as downstream demands. For the Macquarie Valley, a New South Wales sub-catchment of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, we project changes in land and water use and changes in economic surpluses under two policy settings: without and with a policy requiring permanent water entitlements to be purchased from downstream parties, before plantation establishment. Without the policy, and given a high stumpage value for trees ($70/m3), upstream gains in economic surplus projected from expanding plantations are $639million; balanced against $233million in economic losses by downstream irrigators and stock and domestic water users for a net gain of $406 million, but 345GL lower mean annual environmental flows. With the policy, smaller gains in upstream economic surplus from trees ($192million), added to net downstream gains ($138million) from sale of water, result in gains of $330million with no reduction in environmental flows. Sustaining the 345 GL flow for a $76 million (406-330) reduction in gains to economic surplus may be seen to cost only $0.22 million/GL; but this is much lower than the market value of the first units of that water to agriculture and forestry. © 2012 The Authors.

The Mexican mix of irrigation technologies is dominated by flood techniques, utilized on 93% of irrigated land, while drip and sprinkler systems, both with higher application efficiencies, are utilized on only 7% of irrigated land. This paper examines the extent to which government policies can induce the adoption of alternative irrigation technologies to promote a sustainable pattern of water withdrawals. The framework is an inter-regional input-output model formulated as a linear program that solves for cost-minimizing allocations of output that are constrained by regional factor availability. The model features endogenous choice among alternative agricultural technologies and determines commodity prices based on factor costs and on scarcity rents for limiting factors of production. The study defines and quantifies sustainable endowments of water at the regional level and analyzes scenarios that combine fees or caps on water withdrawals with the availability of alternative irrigation technologies. We find that water policies can induce technology adoption to achieve water sustainability, although the national price of agricultural output rises 5% to 8% relative to baseline levels. Furthermore, pricing water for irrigation can generate enough public revenue for the government to cover the full costs of technology adoption. © 2011 Copyright The International Input-Output Association.},

The "social optimally price" of water is defined as the one that maximizes levies on water for agriculture without affecting the regional economy. The environmentally optimal price is calculated with an economic model built over a Geographical Information System (GIS) that allows the economic quantification and valuation of the environmental cost of water in different basins. The optimal price is calculated with a demand curve for irrigation water introduced into a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) to observe if the regional economy can accept higher prices without affecting the regional GDP.

	abstract = {Ecosystem functions are a central topic of environmental valuation research. Lay respondents are usually unfamiliar with the implications of scientific descriptions of ecosystem functioning. Thus, the applicability of stated preference methods for the valuation of ecosystem functions is a matter of debate. In the general discourse on the economic valuation of ecosystem functions, it was suggested to valuate ecosystem functions via the ecosystem services they provide. In this contribution, we argue that the recognition of this principle is the key also for the applicability of stated preference methods to the valuation of ecosystem functions. Successful application requires a precise differentiation between the descriptive realm of ecosystem functions and the evaluative realm of ecosystem services. On this basis, an ecosystem service approach for the economic valuation of ecosystem functions is introduced. We illustrate the ecosystem service approach by the valuation of a hydrological ecosystem function in rural Indonesia. Identification and representation of the ecosystem services were based on extensive investigations of respondent perception of hydrological phenomena. The availability of irrigation water during the dry season turned out to be a locally decisive ecosystem service. Within the case study, willingness-to-pay (WTP) values were estimated for changes in the availability of irrigation water, rattan, shading in cacao plantations, and in the population of an endemic mammal by Nested Logit (NL) analysis of choice experiment data. Only few respondents lacked sufficient familiarity of the environmental goods to be valued. WTP for a reduction in water scarcity by one month was ~ 39-40,000 Indonesian Rupiah/household/year. A rating of respondent comprehension correlates with preferences for water availability. For respondents with above average comprehension (rated 4 versus mean of 3.12 at a 5-point scale), NL analysis predicts a 14.1% increase in WTP. Interactions of attitudinal constructs support the notion that the WTP estimate is an expression of underlying values and risk perceptions. The ecosystem service approach comes at a cost. Because ecosystem services relevant to local respondents are valued rather than scientifically described ecosystem functions, typical 'basic science' models that represent ecosystem functioning cannot be used for the analysis of valuation scenarios with direct policy relevance. Engineering-type models that embody technical and, in our case study, agronomic knowledge are necessary to bridge the gap between ecosystem functioning and their practical implications. A lack of this kind of information also hinders a meaningful application of alternative valuation approaches. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Prior studies of farm-level water use in developing areas have typically been limited to using number of irrigations as a proxy for water use.

Findings indicate substantial differences in water use by farms across seasons and across subareas of the irrigation district. Alternative plans for allocating additional water among seasons and subareas to elevate net rice revenues are examined. The recommended plan predicts higher net returns from rice and greater equality in the distribution of household income than would be generated if the additional water were allocated based on the current allocation criteria. Concurrent application of fertilizer at recommended levels would further increase net revenues and reduce income inequality. © 2014 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In contrast, the descriptor affected willingness to pay only in the consumer sample; decisions about personal consumption of food products might be more affected by the differential disgust-eliciting effectiveness of descriptors than farmers' business decisions concerning the irrigation of products to be consumed by others. Respondents of both samples who were unwilling to use recycled water commodities most often cited feelings of disgust as the main cause of their rejection, supporting the view that successful marketing strategies for this valuable resource must take into account the normative learning histories of potential consumers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This discussion contributes to a growing gender and water literature, arguing for an intersectional analysis that understands gender as necessarily conditioned by poverty, livelihoods, and other factors.

	abstract = {Input subsidy programs have once again become a major plank of agricultural development strategies in Africa. Ten African governments spend roughly US$1 billion annually on input subsidy programs (ISPs), amounting to 28.6% of their public expenditures on agriculture. This article reviews the microlevel evidence on ISPs undertaken since the mid 2000s. We examine the characteristics of subsidy beneficiaries, crop response rates to fertilizer application and their influence on the performance of subsidy programs, the impacts of subsidy programs on national fertilizer use and the development of commercial input distribution systems, and finally the impact of ISPs on food price levels and poverty rates. The weight of the evidence indicates that the costs of the programs generally outweigh their benefits. Findings from other developing areas with a higher proportion of crop area under irrigation and with lower fertilizer prices-factors that should provide higher returns to fertilizer subsidies than in Africa-indicate that at least a partial reallocation of expenditures from fertilizer subsidies to R&D and infrastructure would provide higher returns to agricultural growth and poverty reduction. However, because ISPs enable governments to demonstrate tangible support to constituents, they are likely to remain on the African landscape for the foreseeable future. Hence, the study identifies ways in which benefits can be enhanced through changes in implementation modalities and complementary investments within a holistic agricultural intensification strategy. Among the most important of these are efforts to reduce the crowding out of commercial fertilizer distribution systems and programs to improve soil fertility to enable farmers to use fertilizer more efficiently. The challenges associated with achieving these gains are likely to be formidable. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In a country where agriculture is the largest water user, some irrigation management companies have implemented innovative pricing systems to handle this situation. The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of these new management systems on farmers' incomes, the revenue of the management companies, and the amount of water used. To do that, we develop a methodology using a stochastic model that simulates the representative farmer's optimal behavior in a context of climatic variability. An empirical application is made with a crop growth model and data collected from the Midi-Pyrenees region. The results show that using these specific nonlinear pricing systems allow irrigation water managers to reduce the impact of drought on production. Moreover, the type of pricing implemented depends on the characteristics and capabilities of the water company. More particularly, these pricing systems can be used to anticipate agricultural water demand in order to avoid imbalance with water availability. © 2012 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

Based on a worldwide database of CPR groups, Ostrom proposed a set of principles that broadly captured the essential aspects of the institutional arrangements that succeeded, as contrasted to groups whose efforts failed. These principles can be generalized in two respects: first, by showing how they follow from foundational evolutionary principles; and second, by showing how they apply to a wider range of groups.

The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth reallocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty.

The paper aims to analyze economic and financial performance of the constructed rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas of Beijing through the method of cost benefit analysis. The economic analysis focuses on determining the contribution of rainwater harvesting systems to the development of society, carried out from the point of view of government. The financial analysis allows comparison of the financial implications of using groundwater with using rainwater for agricultural irrigation from the point of view of individual participant, namely the local farmers. The results show that the rainwater harvesting systems are economically feasible. This means rainwater harvesting have positive effects for society. However, the financial feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems depends on the charge for groundwater and on the size of the rainwater harvesting systems. If groundwater is not charged, the rainwater harvesting systems are not financially feasible. If groundwater is charged at 2 Yuan/m3, only large size systems are financially feasible while small and middle sizes systems are not financially feasible. Under these circumstances, only large systems can run smoothly, while farmers may not use the small and medium-size systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As part of two related research projects that focus on how subtle social and environmental contextual variables affect the evolution and performance of institutional rules, several sets of experiments have been performed in laboratory settings at Arizona State University and in field settings in rural villages in Thailand and Colombia. In these experiments, participants make both a decision about how much to invest in public infrastructure and how much to extract from the resources generated by that public infrastructure. With both studies we find that head-enders act as stationary bandits. They do take unequal shares of the common-pool resource but if their share is very large relative to downstream participants' shares, the latter will revolt. Therefore for groups to be successful, head-enders must restrain themselves in their use of their privileged access to the common-pool resource. The comparative approach shows that this result is robust across different social and ecological contexts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the Sudano-Sahelian region, which includes South Niger, the inter-annual variability of the rainy season is high and irrigation is limited. As a consequence, bad rainy seasons have a massive impact on crop yield and regularly result in food crises. Traditional insurance policies based on crop damage assessment are not available because of asymmetric information and high transaction costs compared to the value of production. We assess the risk mitigation capacity of an alternative form of insurance which has been implemented at a large scale in India since 2003: insurance based on a weather index. We compare the efficiency of various weather indices to increase the expected utility of a representative risk-averse farmer. We show the importance of using plot-level yield data rather than village averages, which bias results due to the presence of idiosyncratic shocks. We also illustrate the need for out-of-sample estimations in order to avoid overfitting. Even with the appropriate index and assuming substantial risk aversion, we find a limited gain of implementing insurance, which roughly corresponds to, or slightly exceeds, the cost observed in India for implementing such insurance policies. However, when we separately treat the plots with and without fertilisers separately, we see that the benefit of insurance is slightly higher in the former case. This suggests that insurance policies may slightly increase the use of risk-increasing inputs such as fertilisers and improved cultivars, and hence improve average yields, which remain very low in the region. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The pressure on an already stressed water situation in South Africa is predicted to increase significantly under climate change, plans for large industrial expansion, ongoing rapid urbanization, and government programs to provide access to water to millions of previously excluded populations. This article employs a general equilibrium approach to examine the economy-wide impacts of selected macro and water-related policy reforms on water use and allocation, rural livelihoods, and economy at large. The analyses reveal that implicit crop-level water quotas reduce the amount of irrigated land allocated to higher-value horticultural crops and create higher shadow rents for production of lower-value water-intensive field crops, such as sugarcane and fodder. Accordingly, liberalizing local water allocation within irrigation agriculture is found to work in favor of higher-value crops, and expand agricultural production and exports and farm employment. Allowing for water trade between irrigation and nonagricultural uses fuelled by higher competition for water from urbanization leads to greater water shadow prices for irrigation water with reduced income and employment benefits to rural households and higher gains for nonagricultural households. The analyses show difficult trade-offs between general economic gains and higher water prices, which place serious questions on subsidizing water supply to irrigated agriculture, i.e., making irrigation subsidies much harder to justify. © 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

But distributional issues of which segments of adopters of genetically modified (GM) crops benefit the most have not been given ample attention). Using propensity scores, we apply the (a) stratification-multilevel method of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects; and the (b) matching-smoothing method of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects proposed by Xie et al. We find that the incidence of higher yields, lower insecticide use, and reduced seed utilization in the Philippines diminishes progressively as a farmer's propensity to adopt Bt corn increases. Farmers with a low propensity to adopt Bt are those who farm smaller, nonirrigated farms located farther from seed suppliers and farmers without previous training on pest identification. In most cases, while these farmers are typically poorer farmers in smaller parcels, cannot afford irrigation and are situated in remote areas away from easily accessible seed suppliers, there is no evidence, however, that profits differ across farmers with varying propensities to adopt the Bt variety. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

	abstract = {This study examined smallholder farmers' level of perception about climate change, source of information on climate change, types of adaptation strategies, factors influencing adaptation choices and barriers to adaptation in Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. The surveyed farm households in the study area perceived at least one aspect of climate change primarily through their life experience. Planting trees is the major adaptation measure and 89.1 percent of the farmers took this adaptation strategy. Most farmers (96 percent) believe that deforestation is the main cause of climate change and the choice of farmers to plant trees as an adaptation strategy may be partly a mitigation strategy. However, the majority (49.6 percent) of the households employed at least one adaptation response on top of tree planting. The other adaptation strategies include: early planting, terracing, irrigation and water harvesting. The main source of information for these adaptation strategies for 58.4 percent of the respondents is from extension advice. Results of a multinomial logit model showed that non-farm income, farmer- to-farmer extension, access to credit, distance to selling markets, distance to purchasing markets, and income affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Finally, the study identified lack of information as the most important barrier to climate change adaptation. The other barriers include: lack of farm inputs, shortage of land, lack of money, lack of water and shortage of labor. © 2013, Tessema et al.; licensee Springer.},

	abstract = {Increased irrigation has been identified as an important potential adaptation to meet growing world food demand. Yet many of the world's major irrigation regions are in arid and semi-arid regions that face climate change projections of hotter and drier weather. A growing body of analysis assesses irrigated agriculture impacts of climate change in such regions. Most published literature focuses on reductions in the mean-levels of freshwater supplies; less information is available on the potential impacts from changes in the reliability and quality of those diminishing water supplies. This article investigates the combined impacts on irrigated agricultural food supply from reduced, more variable and more saline water supply for a representative semi-arid irrigation region. Results indicate that understanding the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural production requires an understanding of not only how production may adapt to changes in mean water supplies, but also how it may respond to changes in water supply variability and salinity. We illustrate, using an Australian, Murray Darling Basin semi-arid region example, that ignoring these combined water-related climate effects lead to results that overlook thresholds where the structure of production and cost incurred fundamentally change above certain levels of variability and salinity. © 2012.},

	abstract = {Water reuse and pollutant removal efficiency analysis of the on-farm irrigation tanks (OFTs) was carried out in rice paddy field region of Zhanghe Irrigation District, Southern China through field experiments during the rice growing season of 2009-2011. Water flow measurements indicate that 20.6-68.9% of drainage water captured by OFTs was reused for supplemental irrigation. Rainfall was the most important factor that determines the water reuse efficiency (WRR) of OFTs, since higher rainfall resulted in higher surplus irrigation water draining out of OFTs without reuse, and thus decreased WRR. Fully using the storage capacity for storing return flow, and releasing totally for supplemental irrigation also enhanced WRR of OFTs. Water quality analysis shows that OFTs removed 47.2% of total phosphorous (TP) and 60.8% of total nitrogen (TN) of inflow and have a great effect on increasing sedimentation for return flow as the mean of removal efficiency of pollutant load (REL) for suspended solids (SS) amounted to 68.4%. For water treatment effectiveness of OFTs, high hydraulic retention time (HRT) is most beneficial to increase REL of TN whereas REL of TP is not sensitive to HRT. These results confirm that OFTs can effectively increase agricultural return flow reuse and remove pollutants. As the cascade OFTs irrigation system recycle return flow for several times, the irrigation water demand from outside of region was reduced significantly for rice production. Coupling with the effect of cyclic irrigation on the nutrients recycling by paddy fields, OFTs irrigation system also considerably mitigate the N and P off-site emission. Therefore, it is advisable to integrate the role of OFTs on water reuse and treatment for water saving irrigation and ecological management of paddy fields landscape. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Market society deepened through the neoliberal hegemony of international development policy and through the indigenous movement's incorporation of market rationalities. Colonialism recurred through hierarchical representations of knowledge and skills reminiscent of long-standing stereotypes of natives, which local indigenous leaders internalized. Both processes unfolded through constructions of value and acts of evaluation. The gap between the market ideal communicated in the irrigation development project and the conditions of actually existing markets that local indigenous people engaged after project closure limited the concrete empowerment of indigenous peoples. © 2012 by the Latin American Studies Association.},

Growth declined gradually from about 1982, eventually stabilising at a low rate in the late 1990s. This paper discusses factors that have influenced these outcomes over the last five decades, in an attempt to inform policy makers interested in trying to restore self-sufficiency. The earlier experience showed that self-sufficiency was technically feasible, but also that its achievement was costly, both fiscally and in economic opportunities forgone. Little appears to have changed in this regard, and recent attempts to shift this cost to consumers by raising rice prices have increased poverty. We show that increases in rice production could best be achieved by rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure and revitalising research and extension activities. However, large investments by the government in rice should not be undertaken in the absence of thorough economic cost-benefit analysis.},

We test this hypothesis by using panel data on investment behavior of Nigerian farmers who received financial assistance on productive assets.

	abstract = {The groundwater occurs in hard rock aquifers, which is more predominant in India. It is more common in the southern peninsula especially Tamil Nadu. Madurai district is located in the central part of Tamil Nadu, underlain predominantly by crystalline formations and alluvium along the river course. The study area being a hard rock terrain, the groundwater is stored in cracks, fissures, joints, etc., and hence the quantity is lesser. The frequent failure of monsoon also aggravates the scarcity of this commodity. In this scenario, the quality and hydrogeochemistry of the available quantum of water plays a significant role for the determination of its utility and in tracing out the hydrogeochemical evaluation. Fifty-four groundwater samples were collected representing the entire study area. The samples collected were representative covering all the major litho units of the study area (charnockite -21, fissile hornblende biotite gneiss-21, granite-4, quartzite-3, and 5 samples from flood plain alluvium). The samples collected were analyzed for major ions and were classified for different purposes like drinking, domestic, and agriculture, with respect to lithology. The comparison of the groundwater samples with the drinking water standards shows that few samples fall above the drinking water limit irrespective of lithology. The samples were classified with sodium absorption ratio, electrical conductivity, residual sodium carbonate, sodium percentage (Na %), Kellys ratio, and magnesium hazard, and permeability index for irrigation purpose found that most of the samples were suitable for irrigation purpose irrespective of lithology. Total hardness and corrosivity index were studied for the domestic purpose and found that the samples of the granitic terrain are safe. Apart from this, index of base exchange, Schoellers water type, Stuyfzands classification were attempted along with Gibbs plot to determine the major geochemical activity of the region. The study reveals that the samples collected from granitic and quartzitic terrains are comparatively better for the domestic and drinking purpose due to the presence of resistant minerals to weathering. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The advent of grid electrification in the Sandveld region of South Africa in the 1980s increased the utilisation of groundwater resources for commercial irrigation purposes. In the wake of the consequent increased pressure on the resource, it behooves landowners to use water more productively and responsibly. This paper calculated the marginal product value (MPV) of irrigation water for potatoes and vine production in this region to assess and to allow the comparison of the productivity of irrigation water with other commodities and regions. However, the results suggested that the scope for leveraging changes to water use behaviour in the Sandveld solely through water pricing is limited. Given that electricity is a critical input for the utilization of groundwater, we suspect that the price of electricity would be a suitable lever to influence irrigation behaviour. In light of the imminent Government electricity price hikes, we advise some further investigation on the impacts these impending hikes will have on irrigation farming in the study area. We suspect that pumping costs (as opposed to the price of water itself) will become the most limiting factor for irrigation water use in the Sandveld in the foreseeable future. A mixture of water and energy pricing strategies therefore lends itself as a more pragmatic policy approach to follow in order to influence irrigation behaviour, as opposed to a sole focus on water pricing. © 2012 Copyright Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate critically the outcomes of a research project involving collaboration with an irrigation company seeking to improve outcomes from its triple bottom line (TBL) reporting process. Given the imminent basin-wide crisis within which the organisation operates due to unsustainable over-allocation of water for irrigation, the paper aims to offer insights from this context as a microcosm of the global sustainability crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on action research with a case study organisation. Organisational learning theory is used to assess the quality and depth of learning that occurred in terms of the prospects for the radical changes needed to retreat from ongoing unsustainable water resource management practices. Findings: The organisation's failure to link past learnings with future strategising undermined the potential for TBL reporting to develop into an iterative learning cycle that can effect change. While "small wins" were achieved, these need to be seen as part of a broader paradigmatic change movement if they are to result in enhanced sustainability. Originality/value: The paper is based on a case study that builds from the authors' review of the literature that identifies ways to improve the process of reporting rather than focusing on report content alone. The case study benefited from substantial access and interaction with the organisation's internal stakeholders and offers new insights about how to improve the process of TBL reporting that builds on theoretical and experiential perspectives of other critical researchers undertaking field-based engagement research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Efficient water resources management is an issue of major importance in the field of sustainable development. Several models for resolving this problem can be found in literature, especially in the agricultural sector which represents the main consumer through irrigations. Therefore irrigation management is an important and innovating area which was the subject of several research and studies to cope with the various activities, comportments and conflicts between the different users. Modeling, and more particularly, the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), allows bettering representing the multiplicity of the different actors (especially the stakeholders and farmers), the diversity of their roles, the communication and the social interactions between them. Another advantage of the ABM, that it has a great potential in representing dynamic processes in a complex system such as Systems of Gravity Irrigation Networks. In our work, we are particularly focused on open canal irrigation networks, since this type of irrigation is the most common in Morocco and exists around the world. These systems are characterized to be energy efficient but have several limitations and raise a large water loss. Proper management of this irrigation systems and better allocation of water resources among the various actors will be therefore needed. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-agent framework modeling of Management Systems of Gravity Irrigation Networks (MSGIN), operating with a water rotation. Our objectives are mainly located on two levels. The first one, concerns the MSGIN modeling by a multi-agent technology and the agent modeling through AML language. The second one focuses on the negotiation modeling among the various stakeholders and users of water resources. For the implementation of our approach, we opted for an open-source environment: StarUML and JADE multiagent platform. © 2011 ICITST.},

The KPP was a Government of Swaziland (GoS)-financed irrigation scheme that enabled 43 subsistence and semi-subsistence farmers to change from rain-fed maize and cotton to irrigated sugar cane. It provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Green Revolution technology upon an African rural community where adopters and non-adopters live close together and where little income differentiation existed prior to the development because the common experience was poverty. A baseline survey of the KPP was carried out in 1997 in advance of the Komati Downstream Development Project. Of concern are the extent and direction of any trickle-down effects from the KPP participants for their neighbours and the consequences of any such impacts 10 years after the project started producing sugar cane. The expectation of the GoS was that sugar cane would benefit KPP participants and neighbours creating a multiplier effect through increased demand for services and increased demand for agricultural labour. Ten years later, these expectations are unrealized. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

First, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to assess the overall WUA efficiency and to evaluate the management and engineering sub-vector efficiencies separately through a mathematical modification of the initial DEA model. In a second step critical determinants of sub-vector efficiency are determined using a Tobit model. A major finding of the study is that WUAs are clearly inefficient. Under variable returns to scale (VRS) specification, the average technical efficiency of WUA was 84.4%. This implies that output level could be produced by saving 15.6% of (all) used inputs. The average scale efficiency was around 96.5%, indicating that many WUAs are not operating at an efficient scale. Results show also that inefficiencies of the management and maintenance are higher than the overall inefficiency. The average management efficiency is around 80.6% while the average engineering efficiency is 82.3% indicating that about 19% of management and maintenance expenditures could be saved if WUAs were operated in a sound manner. The inefficiency found can be mainly attributed to the number of water pumping stations managed and the number of years of experience operating a WUA (age).},

The present study aimed to integrate techniques and technologies that promote the automatic and efficient irrigation of urban landscapes, using alternative sources of energy and water, toward its sustainability. The conceptual unit was able to reduce in 64% the water consumed in irrigation. Rainwater met 69% of the demand and the photovoltaic system supplied all the energy required. The economic feasibility analysis showed that the conceptual unit is financially unfeasible, under the conditions of this study. However, with some interventions for reusing the surplus energy and water, and considering the higher fees charged by other cities, the investment became attractive. In this new scenario, the internal rate of return (15 years) was 27.3% and the discounted payback period was 4.9 years. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Climate change, uncertain future water supplies, growing population, and increased water demands continue to raise the importance of finding cost-effective water conservation measures. Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest water user, so governments, donor organizations, water suppliers, and farmers continue to look for measures that would produce more crop per drop. Despite the importance of promoting water conservation in agriculture, little work has been done that integrates hydrologic, economic, institutional, and policy dimensions of water conservation. This paper presents an integrated basin scale analysis of water conservation subsidies for irrigated agriculture. A dynamic, nonlinear programming model is developed and applied for the Upper Rio Grande Basin of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, USA. Several potential public subsidies of drip irrigation are analyzed for their economic and hydrologic impacts at both the farm and basin levels. Results indicate that water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation produce several effects.

	abstract = {Promotion of smallholder irrigation is cited as a strategy for enhancing income generation and food security for sub-Saharan Africa's poor farmers, but what makes this technology a successful poverty alleviation tool? In the short run, the technology should pave the way for increased consumption, asset accumulation, and reduced persistent poverty among users. Over the longer run, it should lead to institutional feedbacks that support sustained economic development and nutritional improvements. Our conceptual model and review of case studies reveal the importance of three sub-components of irrigation technology-access, distribution, and use-and the ways in which the design of the technology itself can either bridge, or succumb to, institutional gaps. These critical features are illustrated in an experimental evaluation of a solar-powered drip irrigation project in rural northern Benin, which provides a controlled study of technology impacts in the Sudano-Sahel. The combined evidence highlights the technical and institutional requirements for project success and points to two important areas of research in the scale-up of any small-scale irrigation strategy: the risk behavior of water users, and the evolution of institutions that either support or obstruct project replication over space and time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Specifically, global water supply and demand as well as the linkages between water supply and food security are examined. The analysis reveals that the water for food security situation is intricate and might get daunting if no action is taken. Investments are needed today for enhancing future food security; this requires action on several fronts, including tackling climate change, preserving land and conserving water, reducing the energy footprint in food systems, developing and adopting climate resilient varieties, modernising irrigation infrastructure, shoring up domestic food supplies, reforming international food trade, and responding to other global challenges. © 2010.},

However, the existing evidences do not throw adequate insight into the stage of groundwater depletion during which the wheat-paddy cycle becomes unsustainable. The paper strengthens the existing empirical base of sustainability status of this cropping cycle in Punjab. A comparison of irrigation systems in terms of both trends in yield and stability for wheat and paddy has been attempted to arrive at a holistic appraisal of sustainability aspects of crop specialization in Punjab.

	abstract = {Two trends on yields have been observed for rice, wheat, and even edible oils in Asia. The deceleration of yield growth is one of these trends. The other relates to the differential yield increases across countries in the region. This study provides explanations for both trends and relates these to the exhaustion of the yield potential of current technology, emerging threats posed by climate change and other disturbances, varying levels of development across countries and hence the development of infrastructure, among others. Total factor productivity (TFP) estimates for these commodities indicate the potential to overcome these constraints, however. Key determinants of TFP growth were identified and discussed. While the influence of these determinants on the TFP estimates was not tested empirically in this study because of data limitations, evidence of the relationship was clear and strong in numerous TFP studies done for the agriculture sector as a whole, and for rice and wheat in various countries including Asian countries. Long-term growth will have to come from great advances in interventions being undertaken, three of which include (i) major breakthroughs in new varieties and farming systems in both fertile and unfertile lands; (ii) the restructuring of small farms into more efficient, mechanized largescale operations, especially in production areas with good infrastructure for market access and irrigation; and (iii) the development of market mechanisms to enhance the comparative advantage of domestic production and explore the value-adding potential of commodities, particularly edible oil. Three policy recommendations are also forwarded to achieve these great advances: (i) sustained investment in agriculture; (ii) getting the mix of institutions right; and (iii) gearing up for globalization. The role of development partners as well as the private sector in effecting sustainable growth is briefly discussed as a concluding section. © 2013 by Asian Development Bank.},

Its objective was to evaluate the current and future possible policies adopted or to be adopted in order to spur a rational planning and decision making in water management and to give valid scientific answers to the local decision makers. A mathematical stochastic model was designed and implemented using data collected from farms in the area and other local sources. These policies are mainly based on modifying water quantity, the irrigable area, and the flat water tariffs. Finally all these changes are also analyzed in the presence of a volumetric water tariff designed by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Results have shown how fundamental it is to improve distribution efficiency of the channel system in order to increase irrigated land, for the positive socio-economic and environmental impacts on the territory. However, the introduction of a volumetric tariff could be an effective tool to control water demand expected to augment due to such policy measures, depending on yearly water availability; it could be very profitable to the RIB which will increase returns.},

	abstract = {Virtual water is the volume of water used to produce a commodity or service. Hitherto, most virtual water 'trade' studies have focused on its potential contribution to saving water, especially in water short regions. Very little, however, has been said about the opportunity cost of the associated water. The present research critically evaluates the strategic importance of green water (soil water originating from rainfall) in relation to international commodity trade. Besides having a lower opportunity cost, the use of green water for the production of crops has generally less negative environmental externalities than the use of blue water (irrigation with water abstracted from ground or surface water systems). Although it is widely known that major grain exporters - the USA, Canada, France, Australia and Argentina - produce grain in highly productive rain-fed conditions, green water volumes in exports have rarely been estimated. The present study corroborates that green water is by far the largest share of virtual water in maize, soybean and wheat exports from its main exporting countries (USA, Canada, Australia and Argentina) during the period 2000-2004. Insofar virtual water is 'traded' towards water-scarce nations that heavily depend on their blue water resources, green virtual-water 'trade' related to these commodities plays a role in ensuring water and water-dependent food security and avoiding further potential damage to the water environments in both importing and exporting countries. This potential of international green virtual-water 'trade', however, is constrained by factors such as technology, the potential for further increases in the productivity of soil and irrigation water, the level of socio-economic development, national food policies and international trade agreements. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Given the large heterogeneity in farmers SQ water availability, irrigation practices and current water tax payments, the SQ could not be given a unique baseline interpretation. This poses a potential problem for choice model estimation.

The study finds that economic assets and natural capital have differential impacts on short-term and long-term migration decisions. Thus, any employment creation in rural dry land regions is likely to help the poorest. Further degradation of common-pool land resources influences short-term but not long-term migration. Therefore, better management of common-pool resources would strengthen the livelihood base of traditional herder communities and limit migration among middle-income households. Overall, in dry areas such as Gujarat, access to irrigation, rather than land ownership per se, is likely to deter migration. © Cambridge University Press 2009.},

	abstract = {Combinations of factors, including inappropriate economic policies, have contributed to the poor economic performance of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The impacts of some corrective policy measures, both on the macro economy and on the rural economy, are not very clear because they have led to unintended consequences, such as increasing poverty and inequality. This paper examines the effect of the removal of subsidised agricultural credit for irrigation farmers in Ghana, a country of pioneering reforms in SSA. A theoretical model of this scenario is constructed, in which it is shown that under multiple-market imperfections farmers resort to alternative income sources to finance irrigation. Particularly in the presence of off-farm alternatives, multiple-market imperfections can induce both on- and off-farm income-generating activities during the same season. This model is subsequently tested and validated with household data collected from northern Ghana. The empirical analysis shows that there is a strong complementarity between irrigation farming and off-farm employment, two activities that depend heavily on labour endowment. The observed complementarity suggests that in weak credit markets irrigation farmers generate liquidity from off-farm activities, which could lead to a demand for larger family size in the long run. © The author 2007.

Household-level water demands are estimated so that adjustments at both the intensive and extensive margins are captured. The results show that a large gap exists between the cost of water and the value of water to producers. Simulation analysis shows that reforming water pricing can induce water savings. However, the price of water needs to be raised to a relatively high level. We also find that the value-based policy is more effective than the cost-based policy since it generates larger water savings, given the same increase in the average price of water. While raising the price of water negatively affects crop production and crop income, higher water prices do not adversely affect the distribution of household income. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

This issue involves a large number of processes, ranging from field to global scales, which have not been fully integrated yet. In this study, we intend to help bridging this gap by quantifying the effect of farm-scale autonomous adaptations in response to changes in climate. To do so, we use a modelling framework coupling the STICS generic crop model to the AROPAj microeconomic model of European agricultural supply. This study provides a first estimate of the role of such adaptations, consistent at the European scale while detailed across European regions. Farm-scale autonomous adaptations significantly alter the impact of climate change over Europe, by widely alleviating negative impacts on crop yields and gross margins. They significantly increase European production levels. However, they also have an important and heterogeneous impact on irrigation water withdrawals, which exacerbate the differences in ambient atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations among climate change scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we conduct an investigation to assess the economic potential of payments for ecosystem services to conserve water through the conversion of land under irrigation into rain-fed land in the upper reaches of the Shiyang River basin, located in northwest China. We use an approach developed by Antle and Valdivia (2006, Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 50: 1-15) to estimate the supply of water. The analysis shows that it is theoretically possible to reduce agricultural water consumption and subsequently increase the water supply, which would aid the prevention of environmental degradation in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River basin. In addition to the conservation of water, considerable income would be generated by local farmers, which would help to alleviate poverty. Furthermore, the analysis also suggests that more complete data on ecosystem services rates, transaction costs and other related factors would be of value for achieving a more comprehensive assessment.

The subsequent devolution of responsibility for maintaining the collective irrigation infrastructure to farmers created an opportunity to study the factors that affect cooperation in canal maintenance. We used a social dilemma perspective to compare three rice production areas that differed in the extent of cooperation, based on focus group interviews, surveys, and archival research. The findings draw attention to the nature of the resource, the characteristics of the user group, and farmer-based institutional arrangements as explanatory variables. Specifically these include (1) the balance between water demand and availability, (2) the existence of inequities and privileged positions within the group, and (3) the strength of group organization and the ability to sanction uncooperative behaviour. The existence of alternative sources of livelihood also influenced cooperation. Contrary to our expectations, the largest and most diverse group of producers appeared best organized and equipped to engage in cooperation. Size and diversity might actually allow (1) the emergence of institutional arrangements that can overcome social dilemma situations and demotivation emanating from customary privileges and exemptions and (2) better use of Africa's irrigation potential. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Much of the evidence of the impact of irrigation does not use counterfactual analysis to estimate such impact or distinguish between the scale of the irrigation projects to be evaluated. In the dataset collected by the author, both a large-scale irrigation project and small-scale projects are used to construct counterfactual groups. Propensity score matching is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for small and large irrigators relative to non-irrigators on agricultural production, agricultural income and consumption per capita. Small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and agricultural income than large-scale irrigation, but large-scale irrigation has a larger effect on consumption per capita. This suggests that market integration and non-farm externalities are important in realising gains in agricultural surplus from irrigation. © 2010 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

Probability of illness was estimated using the theory of utility-maximising behaviour of households subject to the conventional farm household production model, augmented by adding a health production function. Reduced model and instrumental variable probit specifications both show that perceived illness prevalence is significantly higher for household members working on wastewater irrigation farms than for those working with freshwater.

Domestic price is varied so its effect on the water shortage could be determined. The model also analyses the effect of expanding the wastewater network on groundwater resources. According to the study results, both inter-basin water transfer and demand management tools reduce the water shortage up to 45% in 2020 but water transfer is more effective.

	abstract = {Despite recognizing the vulnerability of Bangladesh's agriculture to climate change, the existing literature pays limited attention to a rigorous, quantitative analysis of farm-level data to investigate rice farmers' preferred adaptation strategies, perceived barriers, and policy implications. By employing data from 1800 Bangladeshi farm-households in eight drought-prone and groundwater-depleted districts of three climatic zones and logit models, this study breaks new ground in investigating farm-level adaptation to climate change. Results showed that farmers' perceptions of climatic variability supported macro-level evidence. Science-driven (e.g., drought tolerant rice), environmental resource-depleting (e.g., groundwater), and crop-switching (e.g., non-rice crops) typified preferred farm-level adaptation strategies to alleviate adverse effects of climate change. Drought severity, extent of groundwater depletion, education level, farm-size, access to climate information, and electricity for irrigation, and agricultural subsidies were significant factors underpinning farmers' decision to adapt. Inadequate access to climate information and scientific research outcomes, limited irrigation facility and resource-base represented major adaptation barriers.Strengthening agricultural research and support services including information accessibility, community-focussed farming education and training for improved crop culture practices, and expanded and efficient surface-water irrigation infrastructure are critically important for creating an effective adaptation process to climate change. Scientific research-driven adaptation measures with stronger support systems appear more sustainable. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Existing research shows that significant differences exist in the institutional setup of WUAs in China, and that WUAs have not been universally successful in saving water and improving farm incomes. This paper aims to examine the underlying causes of differences in WUA performance by analyzing the impact of WUA characteristics on the productivity of irrigation water. Explanatory variables in our analysis are derived from Agrawal's user-based resource governance framework. Applying a random intercept regression model to data collected among 21 WUAs and 315 households in Minle County in northern China, we find that group characteristics, particularly group size and number of water users groups, and the existing pressure on available water resources are important factors in water productivity. Resource characteristics, i.e. resource size and degree of overlap between the WUA boundaries and natural boundaries, do not significantly affect water productivity in our research area. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A reasonable hypothesis is that the prospect for undertaking investments in irrigation may be more attractive, the greater the perceived availability of groundwater. The 2001-2 ICRISAT survey asked farmers whether they had attempted to dig a well in the last 15 years and whether the well was successful. It is therefore possible, at least in principle, to use an individual's prior success as a measure of his own perception of the availability of ground water. If one assumes that the two technologies give the same expected profit, the farmer will be indifferent between the two in both periods. However, the farmer can also invest in an asset that increases profits in the second period. The farmer may then opt for the risky technology in the first period if the safe technology does not generate enough profit to cover the fixed cost needed for the irrigation project.},

In order to comprehensively understand the impacts of plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation on agricultural ecosystem services and dis-services, we developed an assessment framework for the net ecosystem services and used China as a case study. Our results showed that, compared to conventional vegetable cultivation, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation has higher fresh vegetable production, greater CO2 fixation (3.61t CO2 ha-1yr-1), better soil retention (23.1tha-1yr-1), and requires less irrigation (2132m3waterha-1yr-1), maintains similar soil fertility, but also has higher NO3- accumulation and N2O emissions. In 2004, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China provided an overall net economic benefit of 67,956yuanha-1yr-1 (8.28yuan=1 USD in 2004), where 68,240yuanha-1yr-1 represented ecosystem services and 284yuanha-1yr-1 for dis-services. The transition from conventional vegetable cultivation to plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation resulted in a net economic benefit of 24,248yuanha-1yr-1. A cost-benefit analysis suggests that plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China has the potential to optimize social benefits in addition to increasing annual economic income to farmers directly. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates two market-based policy instruments, short-term water trading and volumetric water pricing, in a jurisdiction where historical water allocations are based on the seniority of appropriative water rights. The analysis identifies the potential effects of alternative surface water allocations on crop choices and on producer incomes in three irrigation districts in the Bow River Sub-basin of the South Saskatchewan River. The short-run effects of these alternative policy instruments are examined in scenarios where seasonal water supplies are reduced by 10-30% relative to the 2003 water usage levels. An important contribution of the paper is to present a computational, positive mathematical programming model that integrates both irrigation decisions and specific crop choices when characterizing agents' optimal responses to moderate water scarcity. The numerical results illustrate the manner in which the use of these market-based economic instruments can increase the irrigated land area and economic welfare relative to the allocations made based only on the seniority of water rights. Under full information with no transactions costs, the use of water pricing for allocation purposes can achieve the same production outcomes as could be reached under short-term water trading. However, the distribution of potential monetary gains and losses among agents would vary considerably across policies. © 2009 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

An emergy method for evaluating the costs and benefits of the project and a composite index named the emergy cost-benefit ratio (EmCBR) were developed. The emergy evaluation shows that the major costs associated with the proposed project come from earthwork (77.4% of the total cost) and concrete work (15.4%), and that water saving (43.0% of the total benefit) and agricultural yield increase (56.9%) are the most important contributions. The calculated EmCBR is 0.97 (the lowest value for a feasible project is 1.0) which indicates that this project would not be feasible in emergy terms. The regional agricultural system could not benefit from the proposed project, according to several emergy indices: emergy yield ratio (EYR), emergy investment ratio (EIR), environmental load ratio (ELR) and environmental sustainability index (ESI). The results show that conventional cost-benefit analysis could fail to provide an adequate decision-making framework because it is unable to value resources and environmental impacts properly. More additional emergy evaluations should be completed on other alternatives to the proposed project to provide adequate guidelines for selecting the best alternative that contributes most to agricultural development with limited environmental impact. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The response of net revenue from crop and livestock agriculture across various farm types and systems in Africa to changes in climate normals (i.e. mean rainfall and temperature) is analysed. The analyses controlled for effects of key socioeconomic, technology, soil and hydrological factors influencing agricultural production. Results show that net farm revenues are in general negatively affected by warmer and drier climates. The small-scale mixed crop and livestock system predominantly typical in Africa is the most tolerant whereas specialized crop production is the most vulnerable to warming and lower rainfall. These results have important policy implications, especially for the suitability of the increasing tendency toward large-scale mono-cropping strategies for agricultural development in Africa and other parts of the developing world in light of expected climate changes.

We present national-level eco-efficiency metrics in several representative production countries during the most recent decade (2000-2010) for four important crops: canola, cotton, maize, and soybeans. The metrics address greenhouse gas emissions and the utilization of land, water, and energy - all calculated per unit of production. We group countries based on their level of agricultural intensification and find that high-intensification countries are achieving the highest and yet still increasing levels of eco-efficiency, with these decadal gains: canola (26%), cotton (23%), maize (17%), and soybeans (18%). By stark contrast, low-intensification countries had no change in eco-efficiency during this same decade. Overall, our results suggest large opportunities for additional improvements in the developing world, and that cumulative resource savings through intensification have been significant. For instance, in the case of irrigated maize, if the high- and medium-intensification production countries had only achieved the same irrigation water-use efficiency as in the low-intensification countries, approximately 4 quadrillion (4×1015) more litres of irrigation water would have been consumed during the period 2000-2010. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

A questionnaire and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data from 69 irrigation scheme households and an equal number of sampled nonscheme households in the winter of 2013. The study compared the frequency of reported hunger and Coping Strategies Index (CSI) scores. Many households experienced hunger in January and June when children return to school after vacations. Relying on less preferred or inexpensive foods was the most commonly employed strategy, practiced by 88% of the households. Feeding working members at the expense of the non-working was the least commonly practiced strategy (21% of the households). A range of coping strategies were employed, especially during the months of higher incidences of reported hunger. No significant differences were observed between irrigation scheme and non-irrigation scheme households regarding CSI scores. Households in this rural location need to be encouraged to engage more actively in home production. Extension services need to assist in planning these gardens to provide food in months when hunger is widespread. Assistance with savings and household budgeting are essential to help households anticipate and plan for months of inadequate income and high expenditure demands. © 2014 Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

	abstract = {Critics of genetically modified (GM) crops often contend that their introduction enhances the gap between rich and poor farmers, as the former group are in the best position to afford the expensive seed as well as provide other inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation. The research reported in this paper explores this issue with regard to Bt cotton (cotton with the endotoxtin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis conferring resistance to some insect pests) in Jalgaon, Maharashtra State, India, spanning the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Questionnaire-based survey results from 63 non-adopting and 94 adopting households of Bt cotton were analyzed, spanning 137 Bt cotton plots and 95 non-Bt cotton plots of both Bt adopters and non-adopters. For these households, cotton income accounted for 85 to 88% of total household income, and is thus of vital importance. Results suggest that in 2003 Bt adopting households have significantly more income from cotton than do non-adopting households (Rp 66,872 versus Rp 46,351) but inequality in cotton income, measured with the Gini coefficient (G), was greater amongst non-adopters than adopters. While Bt adopters had greater acreage of cotton in 2003 (9.92 acres versus 7.42 for non-adopters), the respective values of G were comparable. The main reason for the lessening of inequality amongst adopters would appear to be the consistency in the performance of Bt cotton along with the preferred non-Bt cultivar of Bt adopters - Bunny. Taking gross margin as the basis for comparison, Bt plots had 2.5 times the gross margin of non-Bt plots of non-adopters, while the advantage of Bt plots over non-Bt plots of adopters was 1.6 times. Measured in terms of the Gini coefficient of gross margin/acre it was apparent that inequality was lessened with the adoption of Bunny (G = 0.47) and Bt (G = 0.3) relative to all other non-Bt plots (G = 0.63). Hence the issue of equality needs to be seen both in terms of differences between adopters and non-adopters as well as within each of the groups. ©2007 AgBioForum.},

	abstract = {The paper analysed how climate change (CC) has shaped African agriculture in the past and how it might impact on African farm economies in the future and what adaptation strategies African farmers have adopted to cope with these changes. The analyses covered all key farming systems and agro-climates of Africa in 11 countries in which data were collected from over 10,000 farm household surveys. Results provided evidence that African agriculture and the welfare of its rural population are vulnerable to CC. The highest risk of future CC damages is associated with specialised crop and livestock farming (mono systems) particularly under dryland conditions in arid and semi-arid regions. This indicates how difficult it is to achieve an African green revolution under the current high reliance on dryland systems (more than 95% of the land) given predicted harsh future climates (warmer and dryer projections) for most of the dryland areas in Africa. It will require substantial public and private investments in expanding irrigation and development of crop var-ieties and animal breeds that are tolerant to heat, water and low fertility stres-ses, and in building roads and marketing infrastructures that will improve access to critical inputs (e.g., fertiliser) and output trade. This essentially requires mainstreaming climate sensitivity as an integral component of all agricultural and broader economic development planning and policy design. Although the expected damages are large, many farming systems and communities in Africa face serious limiting conditions which reduce their ability to adapt and hence increase their vulnerability. Among the key factors found to constrain African farmers' ability to adopt effective adaptation measures are poor access to information, capital, technology and markets. Policies aimed at promoting farm-level adaptation need to emphasise the critical role of farmers' education; provision of improved climate, production and market information and the means to implement adaptations through affordable credit facilities. Other needed public interventions to help promote adaptation measures and reduce vulnerability include insurance against climate risks to farmers and provision of safety nets. © The author 2010.

To address this issue, many efforts have been focused on the possible adoption of sophisticated irrigation systems with high levels of water application efficiency. In this study, the entry and exit thresholds for the low-energy precision application (LEPA) system are analyzed simultaneously in cotton farming in the Texas High Plains using a real options approach. The results show that the LEPA system is profitable only when cotton price is set above $1.59/kg. The exit (entry) threshold is consistently low (high) over a range of values for parameter changes including investment cost, exit cost, variable cost, risk-adjusted discount rate, and volatility rate, so it is unlikely that farmers with irrigation systems in place would leave them easily.

	abstract = {We analyse yield effects of tissue culture (TC) banana technology in the Kenyan small farm sector, using recent survey data and an endogenous switching regression approach. TC banana plantlets, which are free from pests and diseases, have been introduced in East Africa since the late 1990s. Although field experiments show significant yield advantages over traditional banana suckers, a rigorous assessment of impacts in farmers' fields is still outstanding. A comparison of mean yield levels between TC adopters and non-adopters in our sample shows no significant difference. However, we find evidence of negative selection bias, indicating that farmers with lower than average yields are more likely to adopt TC. Controlling for this bias results in a positive and significant TC net yield gain of 7%. We also find that TC technology is more knowledge intensive and more responsive to irrigation than traditional bananas. Simulations show that improving access to irrigation could lift TC productivity gains to above 20%. The analytical approach developed and applied here and the finding of negative selection bias may also be relevant for the evaluation of other agricultural technologies. © 2012 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

A cointegration and error correction modeling approach is employed. The empirical results show that labor mobility from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector exerts negative effects on deforestation in Ghana in the long run and short run. Relative agricultural income exerts a significant negative effect on intersectoral labor mobility in the long run. Deforestation is influenced positively by population pressure, the price of fertilizer and rainfall, whereas access to irrigation infrastructure exerts a negative effect in the long run. In the short run, real producer prices of cocoa and maize exert significant positive effects on deforestation whereas access to irrigation infrastructure exerts a negative significant effect. Fruitful policy recommendations based on the empirical magnitudes and directions of these effects are made in this paper. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2012.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explain why the quality of infrastructure projects in rural China differs from village to village and how project quality is correlated with project design attributes and governance factors. Design/methodology/approach - Using primary data collected by the authors on three types of infrastructure projects in villages across China, they created measures of project quality for each village. They then used both descriptive and multivariate approaches to examine how quality varies from village to village and factors correlated with quality. Findings - Between-project within-village quality differences are small and project design has little explanatory power. Between-village variations are large. There are strong correlations between the ways villages govern themselves and project quality. The authors conclude that it is difficult to make good projects work in communities that lack good governance. Originality/value - Disaggregated data on the quality of infrastructure (and its determinants) were collected by the authors to allow for variation in the type of infrastructure projects (roads, irrigation, and drinking water) and variation in village governance, making it possible to identify and contrast the effects of project design and village governance factors on project quality. As its chief contribution, this work identifies potential ways to improve the quality of infrastructure projects in rural development. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

We analyze the rule formation of a sample of irrigation systems based on the ADICO syntax (Crawford & Ostrom, 1995; Ostrom, 2005). Farmer-managed irrigation systems generally are autonomous in devising their own rules based on local context considering the ideas, norms and beliefs shared within the community. Rule formation in agency-managed irrigation systems, however, is mostly done by external officials. Strong rule enforcement mechanisms were found in farmer-managed systems compared with agency-managed systems. Better rule enforcement created favorable conditions for collective action among the users and ensured better performance of the irrigation systems. Results imply that the formation of new rules should fully consider biophysical attributes as well as community beliefs and ideas. © Copyright The JOIE Foundation 2011.},

	abstract = {In the coming decades, an increasing competition for global land and water resources can be expected, due to rising demand for food and bio-energy production, biodiversity conservation, and changing production conditions due to climate change. The potential of technological change in agriculture to adapt to these trends is subject to considerable uncertainty. In order to simulate these combined effects in a spatially explicit way, we present a model of agricultural production and its impact on the environment (MAgPIE). MAgPIE is a mathematical programming model covering the most important agricultural crop and livestock production types in 10 economic regions worldwide at a spatial resolution of three by three degrees, i.e., approximately 300 by 300 km at the equator. It takes regional economic conditions as well as spatially explicit data on potential crop yields and land and water constraints into account and derives specific land-use patterns for each grid cell. Shadow prices for binding constraints can be used to valuate resources for which in many places no markets exist, especially irrigation water. In this article, we describe the model structure and validation. We apply the model to possible future scenarios up to 2055 and derive required rates of technological change (i.e., yield increase) in agricultural production in order to meet future food demand. © 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

The accumulated insights show the importance of creating institutional arrangements that fit the human ecology within the biophysical constraints of the system. The examples of work based on multiple methods approaches presented here highlight several lessons. For example, experimental work helps us better understand the details of how the ability to maintain trust relationships, low levels of inequality, and low transaction costs of coordination are critical for success. Likewise, the integration of case-study analysis and modeling helps us better understand how systems that can leverage biophysical characteristics to help address challenges of monitoring, sanctioning, and coordination may be able to increase their chances of success.

	abstract = {The hyper-eutrophicated Krishnagiri reservoir is situated in hot tropical and semiarid climate zone in South India. There are 16 villages in the command area, which are directly benefited by this reservoir, and water from the reservoir is used for irrigation, fish rearing, livestock rearing and recreation purposes. The reservoir is located in an agricultural watershed, and the rate of soil erosion in the catchment area is very high. Thus, the reservoir is severely affected by sedimentation, and half of its capacity was reduced. Previous studies in Krishnagiri reservoir clearly indicate the lack of information on the quality of sediments and dynamics of nutrient in the reservoir. Hence, the present study was conducted on bottom sediments, and it included the assessment of physicochemical characteristics and nutrients, such as composition, redox potential, moisture content, organic carbon, organic matter, total iron, manganese, calcium carbonate, different phosphorus fractions and total phosphorus. The increasing trend in organic matter and also the significant change from positive to high negative values of redox potential clearly indicate the inflow of high organic load which may result from the disposal of sewage and industrial waste water in the upstream catchment side. The high concentration of inorganic phosphorus fractions at the inflow point of the reservoir obviously implies that there was a significant input of nutrients into the reservoir. Hence, the study concludes that the rainfall, soil erosion and runoff are the major environmental factors for the input and accumulation of large quantities of nutrients in the bottom sediments of Krishnagiri reservoir during the study period. The present study clearly suggests for a careful investigation into sediment nutrients in Krishnagiri reservoir, and it is also necessary to assess the role of sediments in the phosphorus dynamics and its significant effect on eutrophication. This study demonstrates that the examination of physicochemical characteristics and nutrients in the bottom sediments is a helpful tool to identify the sources of nutrients to the reservoir.

Currently, less than 60% of all the water used for irrigation is effectively used by crops. Based on the new version of the GTAP-W model we analyze the effect of potential water savings and the welfare implications of improvements in irrigation efficiency worldwide. The results show that a water policy directed to improve irrigation efficiency led to global and regional water savings, but it is not beneficial for all regions. The final effect on regional welfare will depend on the interaction of several different causes. For instance, higher irrigation efficiency changes opportunity costs and reverses comparative advantages, modifying regional trade patterns and welfare. For water-stressed regions the effects on welfare are mostly positive. For nonwater scarce regions the results are more mixed and mostly negative. The results show that exports of virtual water are not exclusive of water abundant regions. © 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the financial attractiveness of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation and Reforestation (CDM A/R) in irrigated agricultural settings. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated by analyzing the case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i.e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30,000m 3/ha, to reflect the reality of a high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L. had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within 399-702USD/ha after the assumed 7-year crediting period and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65% with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured -10% and 61% when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26,500m 3/ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4.76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3-30% of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15,300m 3/ha/year at the current tCER price.

	abstract = {Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a drought-tolerant tree which is usually grown in areas with a Mediterranean climate that receive >350 mm of annual rainfall. However, olive growing in Syria has recently expanded into drier areas (200-300 mm annual rainfall) where irrigation resources are limited. This study, carried out between November 2002 and October 2005, aimed to investigate the response of a little known Syrian drought-tolerant olive variety (Qaisi) to water harvesting and limited summer irrigation (200 l per tree) in an arid area (average annual rainfall of 210 mm) with Mediterranean climate in Syria. Soil moisture and growth of four-year-old trees were monitored regularly. Olive leaves were sampled at different stages to determine water content, specific mass, and N content. Stomatal conductance was also measured in 2005. Our results showed that water harvesting and summer irrigation improved soil moisture content, leaf water content (up to 36% higher in Sep. 2003), leaf N content (up to 45% higher in Aug. 2003), leaf stomatal conductance (up to 55% higher in Apr. 2005), and relative trunk growth rate. Water harvesting was most successful in wet years, although the water storage capacity was not enough to retain all harvested water. This study indicated that it is possible to grow drought-tolerant olive varieties in arid areas under little or no irrigation, but proper water and nutrient management should be considered for sustainable growth. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia faced a severe drought which affected its agriculture production. Sustainable diversion limits as proposed in the Australian Government's basin plan together with climate change are expected to impact on future agriculture production and development in the MDB. We developed a biophysical-economic mathematical model calibrated against the observed multi-period land use data utilising the positive mathematical programming (PMP) approach to evaluate the impacts on agricultural production activities of a range of climate events and policy options. This is an extension of our previous work where the model was calibrated against a single year and the focus was on the southern MDB only. The multi-period calibrated model has strong predictive capacity as it matches simulated irrigated area, water use and gross value of irrigated agricultural product (GVIAP) well with the observed irrigated land, water use and GVIAP for all the crops in all the regions of the MDB across the highly variable climatic conditions from 2005 to 2009. The approach will be useful in assessing economic impacts of climate change on irrigation, farmers' adaptation options and/or water policies including water markets and irrigation efficiency improvement. © 2014 .},

Four contrasting regional climate model (RCM) simulations represent climate change until 2050. The RCM simulations are applied to a baseline and three adaptation and policy scenarios. Climate change increases crop productivity on national average in the IMF. Changes in average gross margins at national level range from 0% to +5% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. The impacts at NUTS-3 level range from -5% to +7% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. Adaptation measures such as planting of winter cover crops, reduced tillage and irrigation are effective in reducing yield losses, increasing revenues, or in improving environmental states under climate change. Future research should account for extreme weather events in order to analyse whether average productivity gains at the aggregated level suffice to cover costs from expected higher climate variability.},

	abstract = {During the past six decades, agriculture as a main sector in Iran's economy has been affected by economic development, land-use policies, and population growth and its pressures. From the 1940s until 2010, the percentage of the total urban population of Iran increased from about 21 % to around 72 %. Urbanization, industrialization, and intensive cultivation have dramatically affected soil and water resources. The exploitation of groundwater has been increased around fourfold from the 1970s to the mid-2000s. Total water resources per capita reduced around 23 % from 1956 to 2008. The average annual decrease in the groundwater table in Iran during the last two decades is 0. 51 m. In 2008, the groundwater table fell around -1. 14 m in average in Iran. The average use of chemical fertilizers increased from around 2. 1 million tons in 1990s to about 3. 7 million tons in 2009. During that period, fertilizer use efficiency decreased from around 28 % to around 21 %. Approximately 77 % of the agricultural land under irrigation suffers from different levels of salinity. According to the quantification of four indices, such as soil erosion, fall in groundwater levels, salinity, and use of chemical fertilizer, that are directly related to agricultural land use, the results show that agricultural management in Iran needs special attention to reach sustainable conditions. The total cost of soil and water degradation and use of fertilizers in agriculture are estimated around than US $12. 8 billion (about 157,000 billion IRRials)-approximately 4 % of the total gross domestic product (GDP) and approximately 35 % of the GDP of the agricultural sector in Iran. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa's poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two successful farmer organizations, one of them farming in both seasons (throughout the year), and the other farming only a single season per year, were selected for the study. Overall objective of the study was to examine the impact of group interactions on entrepreneurial behaviour of vegetable farmers. Stratified random sampling was used to select an overall sample of 60 vegetable farmers, having two samples consisting of 30 each from the two farmer organizations. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted using the SPSS software package. Results indicated a significant relationship between the group interactions and entrepreneurial behaviour of farmers. Study revealed effective entrepreneurial behaviour involving high planning ability, and decision making ability. Majority of the farmers were at a moderate level of innovativeness, risk orientation, coordinating ability, opportunity seeking behaviour, self-confidence, achievement motivation, and cosmopolitanism. Group interactions were moderate at seasonal planning, and in selecting of crops. Group interactions were low in land preparation, pest and disease controlling, harvesting, irrigation water distribution, participating in training programmes, and selling. Entrepreneurial behaviour of farmers has enhanced with group interactions. The two farmer groups had significant differences in group interactions and entrepreneurial behaviour due to group characteristics. It is recommended to improve group interactions through awareness programmes, and small group formation activities. ©, 2014, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Israel's wastewater recycling program is unprecedented internationally, with close to 80% of sewage treated and reused in agriculture. This article presents findings from a national survey of Israel's wastewater reservoir network. Israel's extensive reuse of wastewater is possible due to a national network of reservoirs that has been established in recent years. Sixty effluent reservoirs presently operating in all parts of Israel, were reviewed and evaluated for static data and sampled for water quality analysis during the intensive irrigation season of 2008. The measurement of 16 chemical, physical and biological parameters, along with 21 major and trace elements was carried out, revealing a wide range of concentrations that reflect reservoir physical and operational characteristics. Results indicate that 65% and 78% of the supplied wastewater volume met the old 20 mg/L BOD and 30 mg/L TSS regulations for unlimited irrigation. With reference to Israel's updated, more stringent, regulations, only 22% and 28% of the supplied wastewater volume met the new TSS and E.C. regulations for unlimited irrigation, respectively, and only 48%, 58%, 58% and 62% met the new BOD, fecal coliforms, chloride and sodium regulations for unlimited new irrigation, respectively. All measured major and trace elements were well under existing standards, although there were considerable regional variation. Both principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used to examine how the wastewater quality relates to multiple static construction features and operational parameters of the studied reservoirs. Sewage treatment plant technology, along with the reservoir operational regime, were found to have the greatest influence on the organic, nutrient and suspended solids loads of the wastewater supplied. The geographic location of the reservoirs along with their designed area to volume ratio, were found to have the largest influence over salinity components loads. Careful consideration should be given to the aforementioned features in future the reservoir planning process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose - To describe the Pragathi Bandhu Groups (PBG) Model and portray the performance of PBG farmers encouraged by their financial and decision-making participation in micro financing and labor sharing, as well as to analyze the factors that influenced participation of small farmers in PBG.Design/ methodology/approach - The empirical study is confined to the small farmers and laborers of PBG functioning in the coastal districts of Karnataka State in India. The study is conducted in Belthangady and Bantwal Taluks of Dakshina Kannada (DK) Districts-Udupi taluk of Udupi District in the State of Karnataka. Primary data from 100 farmer members, selected at random in each of the Taluks, is collected through personal interview by administering semi-structured interview schedules and open discussion. In addition, the data on the functions and the performance of PBG in the State of Karnataka in India are also collected from the official records of Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP) and their field-level functionaries through informal discussions. Factor analysis is performed with principal component analysis followed by Varimax rotation to analyze the factors that influenced participation of small farmers in PBG. Findings - Results show that the implementation of PBG Model, through the collective participation of small farmers in micro financing, free labor sharing, financial and decision-making activities underlying the functions of PBG Model, has helped them to achieve robust performance in terms of increased savings mobilization, loan utilization, and value of free labor sharing and acres of land brought under cultivation with the help of irrigation facilities created by them. The factor analysis has derived four factors that influenced the participation of farmers in PBG (agriculture development, financial participation, capacity building, and other benefits) which explain 63.701 of total factor variance. Practical implications - The findings of this paper can benefit the small farmers and laborers in replicating the PBG Model and its initiatives that address shortages of labor and credit, as well as the high cost of labor, particularly in the unorganized sector in the agrarian economy. Originality/value - The insights offered are likely to be beneficial to the distressed small farmers, development agencies, and agriculture policy makers to solve the agrarian crisis caused due to shortages of labor and farm credit.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the land management practices used in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia, the factors influencing them and their implications for crop production and income. Several factors commonly hypothesised to have a major impact on land management and agricultural production - including population pressure, small landholdings, access to roads and irrigation and extension and credit programmes - are found to have limited direct impact on crop production and income, though most affect the intensity of production. The increase in farming intensity due to these factors has limited impact on value of crop production and income due to low marginal product of labour in crop production, limited productivity impact of inputs such as fertiliser in the moisture-stressed environment of Tigray and limited adoption of such inputs. We find that profitable opportunities exist to increase agricultural production and achieve more sustainable land management in the highlands of Tigray. These opportunities include improvement of crop production using low-external input investments and practices such as stone terraces, reduced tillage and reduced burning. The comparative advantage of people in the Tigray highlands is apparently not in input-intensive cereal crop production but more in such low-input approaches and in alternative livelihood activities such as improved livestock management and non - farm activities. As a result, greater emphasis on developing these alternatives in agricultural extension - as the government of Tigray has been pursuing more recently with its extension programme - and other development programmes is needed. Food crop production should not be ignored in the development strategy, but more prudent use of external inputs such as fertiliser and improved seeds, and greater emphasis on low external input sustainable land management practices, would be helpful. © The author 2007.

	abstract = {Since the seminal works of Malthus and Boserup, scientists have long debated the impact of population growth and land constraints on the wellbeing of rural people. Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Social uprisings in response to privatization dynamics in the water sector have triggered widespread debate on the social and ecological impact of neoliberal water policies. Much of this debate remains in the urban and domestic water sector, thereby disregarding the struggles of marginalized urban and rural producers who use water for multiple purposes. Furthermore, while private providers are blamed for prioritizing profit over people, it is increasingly clear that while water may be a valuable commodity, the sector as a whole inhibits long-term profitability. Instead, using the concept of "accumulation by dispossession," the current process of privatization is understood as a new round of enclosures of the commons, implemented by a neoliberal state to open up new territories to capitalist development and to capitalist forms of market behavior. The contraction of global markets and the reconfiguration of the public sector as notions of nation and citizenship take on new meanings allow for the commodification and privatization of public goods and assets. Using the case of a Mexican irrigation district the paper shows how notions of scarcity are mobilized during neoliberal reform to reconfigure social relations of agricultural production so as to free up land, water, and labor for the market. This has not only resulted in large-scale dispossession of land and water, but also in stripping a group of their collective rights, and thereby dismantling a collective identity forged on past struggles over land and water. © 2010 Union for Radical Political Economics.},

The projects were conducted without the aim or the tools for a full-fledged impact evaluation. Nevertheless, this paper attempts an evaluation through the use of alternative data sources such as household surveys and geographic information, a strategy of identification of beneficiaries and control households based on spatial proximity to the projects' sites, and an econometric approach consisting of a double-differencing technique. The empirical analysis is guided and interpreted with the help of a theoretical model that considers the effects of an irrigation project on the distribution of production, employment and income for different types of landowners. The paper concludes that the irrigation projects implemented in Peru had a positive impact on intended beneficiary households, but not in the way it could have been simplistically expected. The project did benefit the poor but not by increasing production in their own small plots but by providing them with better employment opportunities in larger farms. © 2011 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {Using case materials from four major cereal growing countries in Asia (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan), the article analyzes key aspects of agricultural input policies in Asia. Results suggest that Asian policies differ from the current wave of African input subsidy programs in three important ways: (i) instead of focusing mostly on seed and chemical fertilizer, input promotion in Asia involved a package approach involving investments in agricultural R&D, irrigation, promotion of domestic fertilizer, and investments in rural roads; (ii) farmers in three of four countries paid higher prices (net taxed) for fertilizer during the height of the green revolution, suggesting that it was the profitability, not the subsidy, that was central to increasing fertilizer use; and (iii) Asian countries did not target input subsidies, but given leakage and diversion estimates of targeted programs, it is unclear whether targeting would have been more cost-effective. Both continents have two challenges in common: degradation of soil health and increasingly larger shares of public spending on input subsidies. The first challenge calls for paying attentions to improving fertilizer use efficiency, which is an achievable target, with high pay off in the long run. The other challenge is now a historical fact-that is, once introduced, subsidies are hard to eliminate, even if they no longer contribute to agricultural productivity growth. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

	abstract = {Purpose – Increasing environmental concerns have placed the need for an enhanced water resources management on the policy agenda. In this context, a restrictive regulation of water withdrawals for irrigation has gained in importance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how a reduction in water quotas and increased water prices affect risk-efficient crop choices and the related economic implications for northern German farmers. Design/methodology/approach – The authors apply a whole-farm risk programming approach to a typical arable farm in northern Germany. By using irrigation field trials, production activities with varying irrigation intensities and inherently incorporated crop yield uncertainty are defined. Findings – In contrast to increased water prices, a reduction in water quotas leads to higher water savings and lower economic disadvantages for farmers. Due to an adjusted portfolio crop choice, as well as irrigation intensity, the reduction in the expected total gross margin is partially offset. Research limitations/implications – This example ensures volumetric water monitoring at the farm level which, however, remains a major pitfall in many other countries. From a methodological perspective, the crop yield distribution choice might affect the findings. Likewise, the consideration of downside risk in an irrigation context appears to be interesting for future research. Originality/value – This is the first paper to compare the implications of differentiated water quotas and water pricing schemes suggested by the European Water Framework Directive, while taking risk-efficient crop portfolio considerations into account. This approach facilitates water reallocation not only between crops, but also in terms of the crop-specific irrigation intensity. Crop yields are based on a unique panel of micro data rather than expert opinions or simulations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This paper therefore provides an overview of the South African water resources situation and wastewater1 generation in order to put the need for wastewater reuse into perspective. Potential for broader implementation and parameters influencing wastewater reuse based on local attitudes and experience were discussed with recommendations to facilitate broader implementation of wastewater reuse. This paper concludes that significant potential exists for implementing wastewater reuse for large non-drinking applications (e.g. landscape irrigation and industrial processes) in arid areas of South Africa especially Western Cape Province. Parameters highlighted from local attitudes and experience to influence broader implementation in addition to aridity include distance from source, retrofitting versus new installations, quantity of reuse, tariffs, source quality, public health, willingness, public trust and knowledge, and regulations and guidelines for reuse. Prior to implementation, it is recommended that these parameters be addressed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Frequent droughts and groundwater depletion are critical constraints to improving agricultural productivity in the semi-arid tropics. India has been promoting integrated watershed management in drought-prone areas to address these constraints. Watershed communities are being assisted to invest in groundwater re-charging facilities. While communities and the public bear such costs, individual farmers capture irrigation benefits. Groundwater is a free common property resource and land users hold de-facto use rights. This has accelerated private irrigation investments and depletion of aquifers resulting in iniquitous distribution of irrigation water. Power subsidies and negligible pumping costs aggravate the problem. These policy failures and low irrigation costs to farmers are displacing water-efficient crops in favor of water-intensive crops in water-scare areas. The paper reviews the village-level externalities that aggravate groundwater depletion and evaluates potential policy options to enhance local collective action in water management. Using 3SLS, an econometric crop-water productivity model is used to evaluate alternative water policy instruments. The results indicate that different types of water user charges can be introduced with modest consequences on profitability and farm incomes. If properly implemented and managed by the local communities, pro-poor policies could bring considerable sustainability benefits and also ensure enhanced equity in access to the resource. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In today's scenario a major threat to human life is the environmental degradation and we ourselves are responsible for such degradation. Human effort since ancient times to increase agricultural production was wonderful. Various techniques of Irrigation for example tube wells, canal irrigation etc. have been introduced. It was considered a boon for the development of society, but due to human efforts to increase the agricultural production at any cost has become a curse for the society. Man always tries to over use the natural resources but in this process they forget that this over utilisation will adversely affect the society in many ways. It can even lead to serious environmental impacts on flora, fauna, human population etc.This paper deals with one such human effort to increase the agricultural production and it is the Canal Irrigation system. The construction of canals is in general beneficial for increasing the agricultural production but they are also responsible, if not properly handled, for some environmental hazards. On one hand financial input is sometimes more than the expected return and on another, if not properly handled and implemented, it causes ecological imbalances resulting in waterlogging, salinization, loss of forest area (due to extensive deforestation), grazing land, crop land etc, which leads to the displacement of human inhabitants and wildlife. Thus, overall this paper focuses on canal irrigation system of the state of Uttar Pradesh state in India.},

	abstract = {The African continent is projected to suffer adverse impacts from climate change, which are disproportionate to its contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions. Africa is particularly vulnerable because it is among the hottest places on the Earth and therefore any further warming will likely have adverse socioeconomic consequences; and most of the economies in this region rely mainly on natural resources and rain-fed agriculture, which are very sensitive to climate change and variability. This article investigates the impacts of climate change on African agriculture and discusses the policy implications for managing these impacts. The modelling results show that Africa will experience the largest impacts from climate change in terms of decline in economic growth and welfare losses. The disaggregated results show that Southern Africa will be the hardest hit region, followed by the Rest of sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and East Africa, in that order. There is therefore need for concerted efforts at adaptation, which should include introduction of temperature-sensitive varieties, diversification of production systems and livelihoods, shift to sustainable agricultural intensification, shift to irrigation agriculture, addressing institutional challenges such as poor physical and social infrastructure, market imperfections, lack of access to credit, and lack of crop insurance, etc. In the long run, emphasis should be placed on diversifying away from agriculture to industry and services. © The author 2014.

	abstract = {While urban agriculture has long been valued for providing food security and nutrition within cities, it contributes to many other urban services that are seldom cited as rationales for protecting or even expanding urban food production. Articulating the actual and possible contributions of urban agriculture to municipal sanitation and health services is critical for sustaining these urban farms and their functions into the future. In the context of the low coverage and performance of wastewater treatment plants in Accra, Ghana, health risk reduction measures implemented on and off farm can substitute to a large extent for this absence of conventional wastewater treatment. We estimate that Accra generates approximately 80,000,000L of wastewater per day, of which urban vegetable farms alone use up to 11,250,000L. By mitigating the health risks for farmers and consumers associated with widespread wastewater irrigation, these urban farms have the potential to significantly contribute to the city's sanitation needs. This could allow partial outsourcing of public health services from treatment plants to the farm, where wastewater is considered an asset instead of a problem. Urban agriculture could also significantly support buffer zone management along streams and rivers, resulting in a reduction of solid waste dumping and environmental pollution, but most importantly an improvement in flood control and related public health challenges. While urban agriculture is not the panacea for addressing these urban challenges, it can significantly contribute to their solution. © 2010 Earthscan.},

	abstract = {The Malawi Government has intensified the use of treadle pump irrigation technology in an attempt to increase agricultural production and also to enrich the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers. As a result, the treadle pump is gaining in popularity among smallholder farmers throughout the country. This study was conducted in the districts of Blantyre in the Southern Region and Mchinji in the Central Region of Malawi. A total of 50 treadle pump and 50 non-treadle pump farmers were interviewed in each district to assess the impact of treadle pump irrigation technology with regard to food security and poverty. Gross margin analysis showed that adopters of the technology had higher net farm incomes per hectare (NFIs/ha) than non-adopters per year. In Blantyre, NFI/ha value for adopters was MK122,855 (US$1007) compared with MK15,987 (US$131) for non-adopters under irrigation conditions. Similar results were found in Mchinji with MK51,858 (US$425) and MK16,090 (US$132) for adopters and non-adopters, respectively. Likewise, under rain-fed conditions, adopters had higher NFIs/ha than non-adopters: in Blantyre, the respective NFIs were MK19,497 (US$152) and MK3344 (US$27), whereas in Mchinji the respective values were MK16,896 (US$138) and MK10,084 (US$83). Furthermore, the well-being measurements and analyses of poverty revealed a higher poverty level among non-adopters compared with adopters. The former also had a greater relative risk of falling into deeper poverty than the latter. Transition matrices depicting movement in and out of poverty showed that from 2004 to 2005, some poor adopters moved out of poverty while some non-adopters dropped from being non-poor to poor. No adopter moved from non-poor to poor. From the results, it is concluded that the Government of Malawi should be urged to increase the availability of this kind of technology to the market at a reduced cost by offering tax incentives to local manufacturers and by using an input voucher system to subsidize qualified poor smallholder farmers. © 2008 Earthscan.},

	abstract = {Over-allocation of fresh water resources to consumptive uses, coupled with recurring drought and the prospect of climate change, is compromising the stocks of natural capital in the world's basins and reducing their ability to provide water-dependent ecosystem services. To combat this, governments worldwide are making significant investment in efforts to improve the sharing of water between consumptive uses and the environment. Many investments are centred on the modernisation of inefficient irrigation delivery systems and the purchase of consumptive water for environmental flows. In this study, we applied spatial targeting within a cost-benefit framework to reconfigure agricultural land use in an irrigation district to achieve a 20% reduction in agricultural water use to increase environmental flows, and improve the provision of other ecosystem services. We demonstrate a targeted land use reconfiguration policy approach using spatial planning and optimisation models. Our model estimates a potential increase in the net present value of ecosystem services of up to $A 347 million. The increase in ecosystem services include recovering 62 GL of water for environmental flows, the sequestration of 10.6 million tonnes of CO2e/year, a 12 EC (μS/cm) reduction in river salinity, and an overall 9% increase in the value of agriculture. Without a spatially targeted approach to planning, a 20% reduction in water for irrigation could result in the loss of $A 68.7 million in economic returns to agriculture which may be only marginally offset by the increased value of ecosystem services resulting from the return of 62 GL of water to the environment.

Design/methodology/approach - East Mitidja scheme is selected for this study. About 134 farms are selected from the irrigation scheme. Multiple correspondence and ascendant hierarchical classification are used as data mining tools to characterize the typology of irrigated farms. Findings - The typology provides a way of understanding the diversity of farms with regard to their socio-economic environment. It also helps to identify those farms that fall into broad categories of unsustainability. The latest implemented agricultural and irrigation policy has a differential effect on various types of farmers, favoring some and discouraging others. The socio-economic constraints have prevented the implementation of various development programs. This situation leads to the unsustainable exploitation of the water and land resources and to the promotion of unsustainable irrigation scheme. Practical implications - The findings and results may help decision makers to implement appropriate interventions in terms of resources, conditions and interests that are compatible with each identified class of farms. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to explore irrigated agriculture development issues in Algeria using multivariate methods. The typological method can help policymakers to identify priorities. It can also be used to predict how different farmers will likely respond to government programs and policies regarding irrigated agricultural development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Integrated watershed management (IWSM) was implemented to address issues of poverty and land resource degradation in the 14,500 ha upper Agula watershed, in semi-arid Eastern Tigray (Ethiopia), an area known for poverty and resource degradation caused by natural and man-made calamities. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of IWSM and determine the land use and cover dynamics that it has induced. The change in land use and cover was assessed by integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Two sets of aerial photographs (taken in 1965 and 1994 at scale of 1:50,000) and Landsat ETM+ image (taken in 2000 with 30 m resolution) were used to produce the land use/land cover map and assess land use change. The results reveal significant modification and conversion of land use and cover of the watershed over the last four decades (1965-2005). A significant portion of the watershed was continuously under intensively cultivated (rainfed) land. The area under irrigation increased from 7 ha to 222.4 ha post-intervention. The area under dense forest increased from 32.4 ha to 98 ha. The study further shows that IWSM decreased soil erosion, increased soil moisture, reduced sedimentation and run off, set the scene for a number of positive knock-on effects such as stabilization of gullies and river banks, rehabilitation of degraded lands. IWSM also resulted in increased recharge in the subsurface water. This study reconfirms the importance of IWSM as a key to improve the land cover of watersheds, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable livelihood. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Economic development and population growth in Egypt continue to increase the demands for water. Meeting these demands places increasing stress on Egypt's water institutions to support the country's need for food, urban, industrial, and environmental water uses. Many studies have examined measures to increase Egypt's effective water supplies or reduce its water demands. However, no research to date has examined economically efficient and culturally acceptable water institutions for improving the economic performance of Egyptian agricultural water use. The aim of this study is to examine the potential for irrigation water trading as a measure to improve the economic efficiency of Egyptian agricultural water use of the Nile River. Using data on Egyptian land, water, and agriculture, a catchment scale framework is developed to characterize hydrologic and economic impacts of limited water trading by irrigated agriculture while respecting hydrologic, environmental, food security, and institutional constraints. Results suggest that expanded water trading among Egyptian farmers could raise the economic performance of Egypt's irrigation water use. That improved performance could increase national farm income by 6.3 to 7.9% annually with little or no loss in water-related benefits outside agriculture. Worldwide, solutions to safeguard food production are needed fast. Institutionalizing currently informal water trading arrangements could be a prototype for measures to promote food and water security in Egypt and in other countries with similar water management challenges. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach – County-level insurance and yield data are used to demonstrate that a gradual shift from yield-based insurance to revenue-based insurance has spatial patterns. Conventional risk variables such as yield variability, price variability, prevalence of irrigation, other crops, and yield-price relationships play an important role in this shift and are consistently estimated only when spatial components are included. A spatial random effects model is used to also identify the impact of spatial lag effects, which include neighborhood spillover and agent marketing effects, on the share of corn acres insured with revenue-based plans vs yield-based plans. Findings – Theoretically consistent variables associated with risk are found to significantly influence the choice between crop revenue and yield insurance. Non-linear parameters identify the region-specific effects from changes in irrigation, yield price correlation, and the prevalence of corn production on insurance decisions. In addition, spatial components such as the decisions made by nearby producers and marketing drives are also found to influence decisions. These results may demonstrate the relative influence of trusted sources, such as nearby producers and insurance agents, on insurance decisions.

The Fei Gai Shui reform has been heralded as a possible solution for reducing the excessive fiscal burden on peasants. While the reform may achieve in relieving peasant burdens significantly, the initial impact of Fei Gai Shui on water resources and agricultural production indicate least satisfactory trends. The policy shows significant impact on rice yield and area. It might also have profound impact on cropping pattern but it has yet to be seen. Dependence on local water resources such as ponds show significant increase after Fei Gai Shui as it discouraged farmers to rely on regional water sources. Although the lower regional water use under Fei Gai Shui reduced the water charges paid by farmers, the savings were mostly offset by increasing pumping costs in accessing water from local ponds. Without any adjustments, the Fei Gai Shui is likely to cause serious predicament in agricultural sector. It is visioned that local water resources such as water ponds will continue to play an important role in sustaining agricultural production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As a consequence, bad rainy seasons have a detrimental impact on crop yield. In this paper, we assess the risk mitigation capacity of weather index-based insurance for cotton farmers. We compare the ability of various indices, mainly based on daily rainfall, to increase the expected utility of a representative risk-averse farmer. We first give a tractable definition of basis risk and use it to show that weather index-based insurance is associated with a large basis risk, whatever the index considered. It has thus limited potential for income smoothing, a conclusion which is robust to the utility function. Second, in accordance with the existing agronomical literature we find that the length of the cotton growing cycle, in days, is the best performing index considered. Third, we show that using observed cotton sowing dates to define the length of the growing cycle significantly decreases the basis risk, compared to using simulated sowing dates. Finally we find that the gain of the weather-index based insurance is lower than that of hedging against cotton price fluctuations provided by the national cotton company. This casts doubt on the strategy of supporting weather-index insurances in cash crop sectors selling at international market prices without recommending any price stabilisation scheme. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation. © 2009 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

Among the three farm sizes in the data set, medium size farmers achieve a higher technical efficiency than large and small farm sizes, suggesting that productive efficiency can be increased with the encouragement of creating medium size holdings. The observed decreasing returns to scale also implies that productivity gains could be achieved by breaking up of large farms into small family farms. The technical inefficiency model suggests the potential for shifting the production frontier upwards by providing ownership of land, increasing farmers' education and knowledge, and increasing land quality, including irrigation facilities. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The overall goal of our article is to better understand which matters for water savings, farmer income and poverty in China's irrigation systems: incentives to managers or participation of farmers. To pursue this goal, the article has three objectives. First, we track the evolution of water management reform, examining the practice of providing incentives to managers, and increasing the participation of farmers. Second, we identify the impact of water management reform on crop water use. Specifically, we want to measure whether or not incentives to managers and farmer participation in water management institutions affect the performance of the irrigation system. Because we also are interested in the potential results of water management reform, the article explores how changes in incentives and farmer participation affect farmer income and poverty. Based on a random sample of 51 villages and 189 farmers in four large irrigation districts in Ningxia and Henan provinces, both in China's Yellow River Basin, our results show that the two major forms of water management reform, water users' associations (WUAs) and contracting, have begun to systematically replace traditional forms of collective management. Our analysis demonstrates, however, that it is not the nominal implementation of the reform that matters, but rather it is the creation of new management institutions that offer water managers monetary incentives that lead to water savings. In contrast to the original design of China's reform policies, participation of farmers has not played a role in saving water. Importantly, given China's concerns about national food production and poverty alleviation, the reductions in water, at least in our sample sites, do not lead to reductions in income and do not increase the incidence of poverty. © 2006 International Association of Agricultural Economics.},

Higher energy prices raise farmer costs for diesel and other fuels, irrigation water, farm chemicals, and grain drying. Simultaneously, renewable energy options become more attractive to agricultural producers. We consider both of these impacts, estimating the economic and environmental consequences of higher energy prices on U.S. agriculture. To do this we employ a price-endogenous agricultural sector model and solve that model for a range of carbon-tax-based energy price changes. Our results show mostly positive impacts on net farm income in the intermediate run. Through market price adjustments, fossil fuel costs are largely passed on to consumers. Additional farm revenue arises from the production of biofuels when carbon taxes reach $30 per ton of carbon or more. Positive environmental benefits include not only greenhouse gas emission offsets but also reduced levels of nitrogen leaching.

	abstract = {Soils in arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) are fragile, low in fertility and susceptible to erosion and leaching. To address these problems, activities were implemented in 1998–2003 to identify current problems, and design, test, implement, demonstrate and disseminate improved, integrated soil fertility management techniques. Current soil fertility management results in slightly negative nutrient balances, especially for phosphorus and potassium. Recycling of nutrients through crop residues and animal manure is inefficient, with evidently high losses. Due to the relatively high price of fertilisers and the high risks of crop failure, use of mineral fertilisers is restricted to market-oriented farms with access to irrigation facilities. Of the total farm household population, 35–85% lives below the poverty line. Applying higher rates of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and/or fertilisers is unattractive and risky. Combinations of FYM and fertilisers give better financial returns than either of the two alone. Where irrigation is available, farmers adopt innovative farming systems that include higher application of mineral and organic fertilisers, and result in higher and more stable yields and higher financial returns. A set of specific policy measures for the semi-arid areas were identified to arrive at necessary changes in the economic environment, leading to a wider range of financially attractive technology options for smallholders. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {A research project was carried out in two areas in the outskirts of Hanoi city using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The objective was to study interactions among the vegetable farming systems and the peri-urban context within which they are situated. The farms studied were characterised as small-scale farms that use high inputs of soil amendments and pesticides for diversified crop rotation systems. The main source of irrigation water and nutrients for vegetable farming in southern Hanoi is wastewater from the To Lich River. In northern Hanoi, irrigation water is obtained directly from the Red River and nutrients are supplied through high fertiliser inputs. The concentrations of COD (144–287 mg l−1), N-NH4+ (1–25 mg l−1), PO43− (0.5–4 mg l−1) and coliform (525 × 103−28 × 106 MPN 100 ml−1) along the To Lich River was much higher than the limits specified in the Vietnamese standard for water used in agriculture. A higher Cu content in soil in Phuc Ly seems to be linked to the high input of chicken manure at the site. However, the contents of heavy metals in irrigation water, in vegetables and in the soil surface layer at the two sites were lower than the Vietnamese maximum permissible levels. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews various theories under NIE from both conceptual and empirical perspectives. It then reviews the various definitions of institutions and show that institutions are essential to overcome problems of information and uncertainty. Findings - The review finds that weak institutions can undermine development and hence governments in developing countries should strengthen their institutions to provide greater scope for efficient functioning of markets. Where the market does not work owing to high transactions costs, traditional institutions of collective action and group decision making can work and hence need to be recognised. Research limitations/implications - The major implications of the paper is that in developing countries, a clear understanding of various institutions such as user groups, inter-linked credit markets, rotational irrigation etc. is needed before they are replaced or modified by other institutions. The main limitations of NIE are that there can be capture by elites of various institutional innovations in rural areas, and that it does not explicitly consider income distribution and uncertainty which are glossed over and hence remain areas for future research. Originality/value - This paper critically reviews the various institutional environments that developing countries face in addressing development issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Results showed that the portfolio of irrigation schedules for a risk averse farmer may include schedules with high production risk, due to the interaction of resource use between alternatives when water is limited. Owing to the difficulty of implementing the best portfolio of irrigation schedules, the optimised schedules may best be used to benchmark the efficiency of second best alternatives that are easier to implement. Ignoring risk may underestimate the value decision-makers attach to the security of water supply and policy-makers should take cognisance of this result.},

It finds that while agricultural growth is the key determinant of rural poverty declines, there is significant spatial dependence in the growth rates of agricultural output. Irrigation is the primary driver of agricultural growth, and spatial variations in irrigation development seem to be associated with agro-ecological conditions which may be vastly different within Indian states, parts of which may be similar to those prevailing in geographically contiguous states.

	abstract = {In Afghanistan, after two decades of civil strife and successive droughts from 1998 to 2002, large inflows of food aid, distributed mainly to returning refugees and through food for work programs, have helped offset production shortfalls of wheat, the country's major staple. At the same time, private international trade from neighboring countries, especially Pakistan, has also played a major role in augmenting wheat supply and stabilizing prices. This paper presents an analysis of wheat prices and market flows in Afghanistan based on results of surveys of wheat traders and millers, and econometric analysis of price movements in major markets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In spite of food aid imports, domestic prices were not lowered below import parity levels in most major Afghan markets. Thus, the price evidence suggests that large-scale inflows of food aid, which benefited the country by providing resources for targeted food for work and other programs, did not have major price disincentive effects on domestic production, at least through mid-2003. However, following the 2003 bumper harvest, the analysis suggests that continued food aid inflows may have depressed producer prices by as much as about 15%. Moreover, given substantial prospects for rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure, there is ample scope for increasing domestic production of wheat and decreasing import demand, so price disincentive effects of food aid remain a possibility in the future, as well. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The track record of community-based programs of natural resources governance in implementing the plans they have developed has been patchy at best. In particular, hopes that farmers' participation in decision-making within such programs would lead them to cooperate more voluntarily in implementing agreed solutions are frequently not realised. This article seeks to enhance implementation capacities in such community-based programs by furthering our empirical understanding of the factors affecting farmers' preparedness to cooperate in providing the kinds of collective goods with which these programs are typically concerned. The particular case studied concerns farmers in a major irrigated region of the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia faced with rising watertables and consequent worsening problems of irrigation salinity and waterlogging. Their jointly owned irrigation company-a common property regime-has been devolved rights and responsibilities for enforcing implementation of plans for collective action solving these problems that the farmers have helped develop and agreed to carry out. The empirical analysis involved ordered-probit multiple regression using data obtained from a face-to-face survey of 235 farm businesses. A key finding is that the farmers' preparedness to cooperate in implementing the agreed plans is more sensitive to socially oriented factors like perceptions of community benefits, and trust that others will also cooperate, than it is to the private materialistic considerations-like distributive fairness and business security-typically focussed upon by governments in attempting to motivate farmer cooperation. Since it is not at all obvious that the costs of satisfying farmers' demands for business security or distributive fairness are less than that of promoting their trust in others, or their awareness of community benefits from conservation activities, it seems reasonable to suggest that these more socially oriented factors should be taken more seriously in designing and implementing programs of natural resources governance than has normally been the case to date. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows that unlike a pollution tax that achieves abatement through three mechanisms, a negative extensive margin effect, a negative intensive margin effect and a technology switching effect, a cost-share subsidy and an input reduction subsidy are much more restricted in the types of incentives they provide for conservation of polluting inputs and adoption of a conservation technology to control pollution. Moreover, they may lead to varying levels of expansion of land under production. Costs of abatement with alternative policies and implications for production and government payments are compared using a simulation model for controlling drainage from irrigated cotton production in California, with drip irrigation as a conservation technology. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The other indicates a cluster of high poverty rural areas, where agriculture is the dominant economic activity, and where spatial clustering is associated with factors influencing agricultural production. Agricultural smallholdings are positively associated with spatial clustering of poor rural areas. In areas where water availability is low, better access to irrigation significantly reduces poverty.

However, the social and ecological consequences of activities dealing with short-term disturbances may increase the vulnerability of the system to infrequent events or to long-term change in patterns of short-term variability. Exploring this possibility requires the study of long-term, transformational change. The archaeological record provides many examples of long-term change, such as the Hohokam who occupied the Phoenix Basin for over a thousand years and developed a complex irrigation society. In the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, the Hohokam society experienced reductions in complexity and scale possibly associated with regional climatic events. We apply a framework designed to explore robustness in coupled social-ecological systems to the Hohokam Cultural Sequence. Based on this analysis, a stylized formal model is developed to explore the possibility that the success of the Hohokam irrigation system and associated social structure may have increased their vulnerability to rare climactic shocks. © 2006, The JOIE Foundation.

	abstract = {Water availability patterns in semiarid regions are typically extremely variable. Even in basins with a highly developed infrastructure, users are subject to unreliable water supplies, incurring substantial economic losses during periods of scarcity. More flexible instruments, such as voluntary exchanges of water among users, can help users to reduce risk exposure. This article looks at the effects of spot water markets on the economic risk caused by water availability variations. Our theoretical and empirical risk analyses are based on the random profits of water users. Profit probability density functions are formally and graphically characterized for both water sellers and buyers under several possible market outcomes. We conclude from this analysis that, where water supply is stochastic, water markets unambiguously reduce both parties' risk exposure. The empirical study is conducted on an irrigation district in the Guadalquivir Valley (Southern Spain), where there is a high probability of periods of extreme water scarcity. Water demand functions for the district representative irrigators and a spatial equilibrium model are used to simulate market exchanges and equilibrium. This programming model is combined with statistical simulation techniques. We show that the profit probability distribution of a representative irrigator is modified if water exchanges are authorized, leading to risk reductions. Results also indicate that if the market were extended to several districts and users that are subject to varying hydrological risk exposure, extremely low-profit events would be less likely to occur. In sum, we show that exchanging water in annual spot markets can reduce farmers' economic vulnerability caused by water supply variability across irrigation seasons. These results support the water policy reform carried out in Spain in 1999 to allow for voluntary water exchanges among right holders.},

Results show that production exhibits constant returns to scale and although feed concentration and the number of cows milked at peak season matter, the key determinants of differences in dairy farm efficiency are the type of dairy shed used and the proportion of irrigated farm area.

First, we develop a dynamic programming model in order to explain the optimal irrigation management plan. Based on a microeconomic approach describing the farmer's behavior, this economic model, introducing an agronomic model, and an algorithm of solution search, is used to compute a realistic database. Second, these data are used to estimate profit functions by a non-parametric method. The irrigation water demand function is estimated using a non-parametric derivation procedure. An application to irrigation water demand is proposed in the southwestern area of France where conflicts appear frequently. The same results appear for different climates: for small quantities of water available, irrigation water demand seems to be quite inelastic. If one increases the total quantity of water available, the shape of the curve changes and the demand appears more elastic. The threshold price at which the changes in price-responsiveness appears, depends on weather conditions and range from 0.30 F/m3 in a wet year to 1.60F/m3 in a dry year. These results are crucial information for the regulator in order to analyze the effects of a water regulation policy, based on prices. The impact of an increase in the water price will depend not only on the climate but also on the location of the initial and final prices on the demand function.},

Results showed increasing production variability with increasing levels of deficit irrigation, especially when rainfall has significant potential to contribute to the production process. Risk-averse decision makers are more willingly to adopt deficit irrigation schedules for maize due to increased effective rainfall. The conclusion is that the potential to use rainfall more effectively through deficit irrigation is a key variable determining adoption of deficit irrigation strategies by risk-averse decision makers. Localized weather forecasts may improve acceptance of deficit irrigation by risk-averse decision makers. The value of information for weather forecast might be low because of high risk premiums placed on full irrigation by risk-averse decision makers.},

	abstract = {As the world's most populous nation, China has taken various measures to increase grain production output in the past several decades. However, many of the policy interventions to promote grain production are not in conformity with WTO rules and also lead to misallocation of resources and loss of production efficiency. While adequately steady growth of grain output may still be a policy goal for the world's most populous nation with continuous population growth and economic development, it is crucial that the country moves away from many of its past measures and explores alternative policy tools to strengthen domestic grain production. By using agricultural research and irrigation as a proxy, this paper examines the effects of public investment in irrigation and agricultural research on the output increase of grain production in China in a crop-specific manner. The research finds that increasing public investment in agricultural research will bring about higher output in a cost effective manner. Increasing public investment in agricultural R&D, etc., should be considered with high priority in the future to be utilized as a policy tool to enhance long-term food security. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Hydrologic and economic analysis of the on-farm reservoir (OFR) was carried out in rainfed rice-mustard cropping systems in Eastern India followed by 2 years of field experiments in 1999 and 2000. The average contribution (average of 2 years) of direct rainfall and surface runoff from the diked crop fields contributed, respectively, about 79.5 and 20.5% to the total OFR inflow. The average contribution of evaporation loss, seepage and percolation loss and supplemental irrigation from the OFR contributed, respectively, about 10.0, 31.2 and 58.8% to the total OFR outflow. There was an average increase of rice yield of 44.0% over the rainfed rice because of application of 8.4 cm supplemental irrigation from the OFR. Thus, with an application of 4.5 cm supplemental irrigation from the OFR, 15.40% increase of mustard yield was recorded in 1999. Economic analysis indicated average net profit of Rs. 700 (US$ 1 = Rupees (Rs.) 44.75 in Indian currency) from a farm area of 800 m2. Average values of benefit-cost ratio, internal rate of return and pay back period of the OFR irrigation system were evaluated as 1.17, 14.8%, and 16 years, respectively. The study reveals that the OFR irrigation in small landholders is economically feasible system for rainwater harvesting and providing supplemental irrigation in rainfed farming system. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Water, the environment, and food production are closely interrelated at the local, regional and global levels. With rapidly increasing water demands, the competition among household, industrial, environmental, and agricultural water uses has been escalating in many regions. Although the achievements of irrigation in ensuring food security and improving rural welfare have been impressive, past experiences also indicate problems and failures of irrigated agriculture, often related to environmental issues including groundwater overdraft, water quality reduction, waterlogging, and salinization. Hydrological records over a long period have shown a marked reduction in the annual discharge on some of the world's major rivers (OECD), due in significant part to growth in agricultural water consumption. These developments raise the question of whether water scarcity will constrain food production growth, particularly in the developing world. This paper assesses the impact of water supply on future food production growth, and the tradeoffs between increased allocation of water to environmental purposes, the elimination of groundwater overdraft, and food production. The analysis uses an integrated global water and food model and employs alternative scenario assessments to examine the degree to which water will constrain future food production, and the implications of competition for water between agriculture and the environment.},

The geographic information system (GIS) technique has been used for evaluating ecological criteria and integrating information for use in the cost-benefit analysis at different levels of computation process. The environmental costs and economic value of water associated with the lowland irrigated agriculture are estimated using both the direct and indirect economic valuation approaches. Various sets of alternatives were designed for promoting sustainable use of resources, and the net present value is estimated in each of these cases by incorporating environmental costs and economic values of water obtained from different methods. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) carried out in these different cases indicated that diversification of crops, rather than the conventional monocropping system, would promote sustainable resource use and generate higher benefits to the farmers and society, if external costs, such as environmental costs and scarcity value of irrigation water, and ecological sustainability criteria are also considered in the economic decision-making process. The results of the case study also indicated that sustainability criteria could well be incorporated into the CBA in a single project case by addressing local people's concerns, resource scarcity values and ecological sustainability criteria with the use of spatial analysis techniques such as GIS.},

Using data for Vietnam, commonly used estimates of the benefits from irrigation investments based on means are compared with impacts assessed through an econometric modelling of marginal returns that allows for household and area heterogeneity using integrated household-level survey data. The simpler method performs well in estimating average benefits nationally but can be misleading for some regions, and, by ignoring heterogeneity, it overestimates gains to the poor and underestimates gains to the rich. At moderate to high cost levels, ignoring heterogeneity in impacts results in enough mistakes to eliminate the net benefits from public investment. When irrigating as little as 3 percent of Vietnam's nonirrigated land, the savings from the more data-intensive method are sufficient to cover the full cost of the extra data required, ignoring other benefits from that data.},

	abstract = {This paper asks: What can be done to expand input use in Africa? and Can it be done in a manner that supports continued growth of private sector input markets? The precarious food security situation in many African countries has prompted governments and donors to use input distribution or credit programs as a means of rapidly increasing food supply for the poor. These efforts, however, often reduce the ability of input market development programs to stimulate commercial interest in input supply. A review of both types of programs describes recent efforts to address constraints to expanded input use and finds that further expansion is often constrained by inadequate investment in a variety of public goods needed to stimulate input-led agricultural intensification. Rather than continuing to invest resources in programs to provide inputs or credit directly to farmers, governments (with donor assistance) should consider shifting their focus to the serious deficiencies in the provision of public goods (roads, irrigation, basic education, market information systems, research and extension) and improved institutions (contract law and enforcement, systems of grades and standards). Improvements in these areas can both lower costs of supply and increase farm-level demand, creating a situation where the private sector will have greater incentives to expand input distribution networks to zones and farmers who currently do not have access. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We then value the recharge function as an environmental input into the dry season agricultural production and derive appropriate welfare change measures. Welfare change is calculated using the estimated production functions and hypothetical changes in groundwater recharge and hence, groundwater levels. By focusing on agricultural production dependent solely on groundwater resources from the shallow aquifer, this study establishes that the groundwater recharge function of the wetlands is of significant importance for the floodplain.

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions due to fossil fuel consumption are well recognized as a major contributor to climate change. In the debate on dealing with this threat, expectations are high that agriculture based economies of the developing world can help alleviate this problem. But, the contribution of agricultural operations to these emissions is fairly small. It is the clearing of native ecosystems for agricultural use in the tropics that is the largest non-fossil fuel source of CO2 input to the atmosphere. Our calculation show that the use of fossil energy and the concomitant emission of CO2 in the agricultural operational sector - i.e. the use of farm machinery, irrigation, fertilization and chemical pesticides - amounts to merely 3.9% of the commercial energy use in that part of the world. Of this, 70% is associated with the production and use of chemical fertilizers. In the absence of fertilizer use, the developing world would have converted even more land for cultivation, most of which is completely unsuitable for cultivation. Current expectations are that reforestation in these countries can sequester large quantities of carbon in order to mitigate excessive emissions elsewhere. But, any program that aims to set aside land for the purpose of sequestering carbon must do so without threatening food security in the region. The sole option to liberate the necessary land for carbon sequestration would be the intensification of agricultural production on some of the better lands by increased fertilizer inputs. As our calculations show, the sequestration of carbon far outweighs the emissions that are associated with the production of the extra fertilizer needed. Increasing the fertilizer use in the developing world (without China) by 20%, we calculated an overall net benefit in the carbon budget of between 80 and 206 Mt yr-1 dependent on the carbon sequestration rate assumed for the regrowing forest. In those regions, where current fertilizer use is low, the relative benefits are the highest as responding yield increases are highest and thus more land can be set aside without harming food security. In Sub-Saharan Africa a 20% fertilizer increase, which amounts to 0.14 Mt of extra fertilizer, can tie up somewhere between 8 and 19 Mt of CO2 per year (average: 96 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In the Near East and North Africa with a 20%-increased fertilizer use of 0.4 Mt yr-1 between 10 and 24 Mt of CO2 could be sequestered on the land set aside (40 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In South Asia this is 22-61 Mt CO2 yr-1 with an annual additional input of 2.15 Mt fertilizer (19 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In fact, carbon credits may be the only way for some of the farmers in these regions to afford the costly inputs. Additionally, in regions with already relatively high fertilizer inputs such as in South Asia, an efficient use of the extra fertilizer must be warranted. Nevertheless, the net CO2 benefit through implementation of this measure in the developing world is insignificant compared to the worldwide CO2 output by human activity. Thus, reforestation is only one mitigating measure and not the solution to unconstrained fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Carbon emissions should, therefore, first of all be reduced by the avoidance of deforestation in the developing world and moreover by higher energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on policy interventions for improving irrigation water allocation decisions by including both macro and micro considerations in a unified analytical CGE framework. The approach is demonstrated, using the case of Morocco, by analyzing selected policy (top-down and bottom-up) interventions and external shocks that affect the water sector. Both direct and indirect effects of these interventions are identified. The top-down (macro-to-micro) links are of a trade reform type. The bottom-up (micro-to-macro) links pertain to changes in farm water assignments and the possibility of water trading. We find that water productivity is strongly influenced by these policies, with the general equilibrium (indirect) effects modifying and sometimes reversing the partial equilibrium (direct) effects. We also find that the impacts of the two reforms we assessed are different, with trade reform having an absolute impact of a higher magnitude than the water reform. Finally, we show that the sequence of introducing the policy reforms matters. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our model approach in the case of the Water Directive Framework and the Common Agricultural Policy, both applied in EU countries in an antagonistic manner. © 2005 Society for Policy Modelling.

	abstract = {Measurement of the likely magnitude of the economic impact of climate change on African agriculture has been a challenge. Using data from a survey of more than 9,000 farmers across 11 African countries, a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of -1.9) and livestock (-5.4), whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5), which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first, warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock. Warming, however, will likely reduce dryland farm income immedia-tely. The final effects will also depend on changes in precipitation, because revenues from all farm types increase with precipitation. Because irrigated farms are less sensitive to climate, where water is available, irrigation is a practical adaptation to climate change in Africa. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {The research was conducted for a representative 50 ha farm in the Onderberg region in Mpumalanga province, where farmers use a combination of centre-pivot, drip, and dragline systems of different sizes to grow sugarcane. The main intention was to establish a multi-period linear programming model capable of economically evaluating a farm's expansion decision-making process for farmers faced with investment decisions in alternative irrigation systems, taking into account the available initial capital of the farm. A linear programming (LP) model was used to assign a mainline for a total of twelve irrigation system combinations based on the assumption that the farmer wishes to start with a 30 ha centre-pivot investment. The Generalized Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) was used to formulate the farm growth model as mixed integer dynamic linear programming (MIDLP) for a 15-year planning horizon. Based on the results, farmers are initially forced to invest in lower-cost irrigation systems when they lack capital to start a farm business due to the time value of money. They only consider lowering operating costs by investing in capital intensive irrigation systems when they have more own capital or borrowing capacity.},

This paper presents a multidisciplinary framework of the dynamic interactions between the hydrology, bio-physical and economics of irrigated agriculture in a semi arid area. Status quo drainage and cropping situations are compared to a scenario of increased drainage and leaching and subsequent higher value crops. Stochastically generated hydrology data fitted to a salinisation:yield production function is inputted in a crop enterprise budget (CEB) simulation model. Results show losses due to salinisation of up to R6 962/ha, which exceed the direct costs of installing drainage to control salinisation. Although feasible, farmers at this stage of degradation often do not have the financial ability to repay the loans. Where losses do not exceed the financial costs of drainage, soils are further degrading, higher value crops cannot be planted and potential benefits are lost to society, motivating a green box grant. A macro-economic analysis reveals that the potential benefits to society of drainage can repay the total cost of all necessary drainage in a short period of time.},

	abstract = {The South African Water Research Commission (WRC) initiated a number of research projects aimed at determining the value of water in different sectors of the economy and in different parts of the country. This research is reviewed. Water values were found to differ significantly between sectors, between geographic areas and within geographic areas. As agriculture is a large consumer of water several studies along different rivers were undertaken, including studies on water quality. Average ratios indicate that agriculture is an inefficient user of water in terms of gross income generated per unit of water and also in terms of jobs created per unit of water. Irrigation farming is, however, an important employer of labour while it contributes 30% to the value of farm output. A marginal approach and water demand elasticities also indicate that non-agriculture generally places a high value on water assurance but little value on more than what it already uses. This may indicate that although water is expected to transfer out of agriculture in the longer run, in the short run agriculture may be its best use. Water efficiency could be significantly enhanced if transfers within and between river reaches are promoted, as water shadow prices differ. Inputs from the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) are important in water allocation due to socio-economic and environmental externalities of water allocation.},

	abstract = {Kahandamodara and Kalametiya are two estuarine lagoons located within about 12 km distance along the Southern coast of Sri Lanka. According to a socio-economic survey, both lagoons have been moderately to high saline water bodies and the latter was an important center of prawn fishery until the late 1960s. Two irrigation projects upstream (Udawalawe irrigation scheme and Muruthawela Wewa), which came into operation in 1967 and 1968 respectively, increased freshwater inflows to these two lagoons and altered flora, fauna, and water quality, with a decline of lagoon fishery as a result. At the same time, the increase in freshwater favorised the Mangrove Apple Sonneratia caseolaris to expand spontaneously. Following many hectares of vegetation increase of this species, our study focused on recovering the economic loss of fisheries decline by using new ethnobotanic information on this species. We found that the pulp of the fruit of the Mangrove Apple is tasty and can be used to prepare a fruit drink. However, it has not been commercialised, or even practiced widely at homes, due to the fact that numerous small seeds in the fruit release certain phenolic compounds when damaged, giving a bad colour and an astringent taste to the pulp. We developed a method to get the fruit pulp from the Mangrove Apple minimising the addition of phenolic compounds. This fruit pulp was then used to produce ice cream and fruit drinks, and the whole procedure has been patented in Sri Lanka for the favour of the local people. Apparently this is a novel mangrove product reported for the first time in mangrove ethnobotany. In addition, analysis of the fruit pulp of the S. caseolaris for nutritional composition revealed that it is very rich in phosphorus and dietary fiber, indicating that these new products may have an even higher potential as a supplementary food. Its use as a health food and as a commercialised eco-product is expected to bring new gains in spite of the former ecosystem and fishery decrease. It is however not known to which extent these novel ethnobiological/socio-economical uses outbalance functions lost by ecosystem degradation. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Large expansion of the irrigated area in the Aral Sea Basin has exacted a substantial toll on land and water resources in the region. Elevated water tables associated with poor irrigation management and inappropriate drainage infrastructure have resulted in significant secondary salinisation of crop lands resulting in declining cotton and wheat yields and eventual abandonment of lands. Costs associated with the installation of appropriate drainage infrastructure in order to reclaim these areas are prohibitive and hence alternative approaches are required that can be adopted by resource poor farmers. In the current study the potential use of Glycyrrhiza glabra (common name liquorice) to reclaim abandoned saline areas was assessed over a four year period before being returned to a cotton/wheat crop rotation. Two adjacent abandoned fields of 10 and 13 ha respectively were selected for the study on which two treatments were imposed, namely, a control that was maintained as a bare fallow between 1999 and 2003 and a treated plot where liquorice was established over this period. High quality livestock forage with a protein content of 12% was cut from the liquorice plot with dry matter yields ranging from 3.66 (±0.06) to 5.11 (±0.17) t ha−1. In addition, root dry matter yields of 5.63 (±1.19) to 8.55 (±0.82) t ha−1 were recorded, this plant component being used in the preparation of herbal medicines and soft drinks. At the end of four years both plots were returned to a wheat and cotton crop rotation. Yields of wheat on the control and treated plots were 0.87 (±0.05) and 2.42 (±0.02) t ha−1 respectively. Similarly substantial increases in cotton were observed with the control and treated plots yielding 0.31 (±0.01) and 1.89 (±0.18) t ha−1. These levels of production on the treated plot exceed the district average for wheat and cotton of 1.75 and 1.5 t ha−1 respectively, clearly showing the positive benefit associated with the growing of liquorice. Water table levels after four years were maintained below the critical level of 2.5 m in the treated plots whilst rising to within 1.99 m from the surface in the control. Salt content of the soil in the treated plot declined over the study while those in the control increased. This preliminary study has clearly demonstrated the ameliorating affect of liquorice in bringing abandoned salt affected soils back into production that is low cost and could be adopted by resource poor farmers. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The comparison of the EGS and universalism through the village-level Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) model reveals that the former is neither efficient nor equitable than the latter unless the state government carefully designs the scheme so that the EGS assets, such as irrigation facilities, are made accessible to the poor without undermining their positive effects on agricultural productivity. © 2006 Society for Policy Modeling.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Effective irrigation management hinges upon effective collective action among farmers and irrigation managers. The purpose of this study is to examine how the institutional design of irrigation agency affects the incentives and ability of irrigation managers to do a conscientious job and to relate to farmers in managing irrigation, and hence affects irrigation performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study compares the Department of Irrigation (DOI) in Nepal and the Irrigation Associations (IAs) in Taiwan. Based upon extensive fieldwork undertaken in the two countries, this study identifies the opportunities and constraints embedded in the institutional designs of the agencies, and analyzes their effects on the behavior of irrigation managers. Findings - The two irrigation agencies are designed upon very different conceptions of how the provision and production of irrigation can be organized. The DOI is built upon the premises of top-down control, a reliance on technical knowledge, professional management, and uniform rules and regulations. The IAs, on the other hand, are designed upon the premises of reciprocity among irrigation managers, complementarity between the agency and farmers' efforts, the importance of mobilizing local knowledge and resources, the embeddedness of the agency in local communities, and a problem-solving orientation. Research implications/limitations - Irrigation institutions that enable farmers and irrigation managers to cope with the problematics involved in the provision and production of irrigation operation and maintenance (O&M) are better able to nurture and sustain synergistic and productive working relationships. Practical implications - The findings of this study can inform policy reform in the irrigation sector in specific, and in resource management and development administration in general. Originality/value - This study provides not only a theoretical perspective for understanding and comparing institutions, but also empirical evidence for understanding how institutions affect irrigation performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, the non-exclusive and site-specific nature of these benefits makes it difficult to fully internalise them through market instruments such as salinity credits.

We analyze decentralization based on urban/rural case studies in distinct geographical regions to ascertain whether it is linked to more efficient water management or sustainable use of water resources, and to examine its development implications. We assess whether or not private sector management is related to a more efficient, sustainable, and accountable management of water variety of municipal and private management arrangement in four urban areas. We find that it has not resulted in efficiency or sustainability gains. For agricultural water management, irrigation districts in two case studies benefited from the more democratic participatory management by water users under Mexico's "transference" strategy, but did not result in greater equity, efficiency or sustainability of water use. We argue that decentralization in the Mexican water sector is context specific, and marked by limited benefits. Privatization is less an instrument aimed at improving efficiency than a channel for preferred treatment for capital accumulation by private entities as well as a legitimized way for the state to transfer the burden of water management to non-state institutions. The creation of new forms of water institutions requires not the retrenchment of the state but rather its involvement to ensure accountability, transparency, equity, and sustainability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The descriptive analysis of the study shows a significant difference in money as well as real wage rate of the districts having irrigation above and below the average. The regression analysis carried out to test the independent strength of irrigation and wage rate shows that there is a positive impact of availability of irrigation (irrigated area per labourer) on the real wage rate of agricultural labourers. The analysis carried out using multiple regression also clearly confirms the positive and significant influence of irrigation on wage rates of both skilled and unskilled labourers in all three time points even after controlling the impact of other determining factors on rural wage rate. This implies that irrigation is one of the key factors in increasing the wage rate, which in turn is expected to reduce rural poverty in India considering the importance of wage income to ultra-poor communities in rural India.},

This methodology overcomes the technical challenges raised by increasing block-rate pricing and accounts for both observed and unobserved technological heterogeneity among farmers. Employing micro panel data documenting irrigation levels and prices in 185 Israeli agricultural communities in the period 1992-1997, we estimate water demand elasticity at -0.3 in the short run (the effect of a price change on demand within a year of implementation) and -0.46 in the long run. We also find that, in accordance with common belief, switching from a single to a block-price regime, yields a 7% reduction in average water use while maintaining the same average price. However, based on our simulations we estimate that the switch to block prices will result in a loss of approximately 1% of agricultural output due to inter-farm allocation inefficiencies. © 2006 American Agricultural Economics Association.},

Using a stylized two crop, two region irrigation system, numerical integration over a bivariate rainfall distribution is used to demonstrate the impact of varying rainfall correlation on water price, expected returns, and return variability. A spot market for water captures the majority of the returns to water rights transfers, relative to a complete market. This spot market results in higher returns and reduced return volatility for farmers in the water deficit region, while farmers in the water surplus region see greater returns but also greater return volatility. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

We documented frequent deposition of volcanic ash deposits to rice producing watersheds. Concentrations of phosphorus in rivers were between 1 and 4 mg l-1 PO4, increasing downstream. We measured extractable potassium and phosphate levels in the soils of unfertilized Balinese rice paddies, and found them to be indistinguishable from those in fertilized paddies, and sufficient for high grain yields. Field experiments varying phosphorus applications to rice fields from 0 to 100 kg superphosphate per hectare (7-26 kg P ha-1) demonstrated small increases in harvest yields only with the smallest additions. Direct measurements of PO4 in irrigation waters indicate that most of the added phosphate flows out of the paddies and into the river systems, accumulating to very high levels before reaching the coast. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Although sustainable agriculture is not limited to production systems that use few or no purchased inputs, systems that are less dependent on external inputs have better prospects for sustainability—as long as they can meet the needs of producers and consumers as well as do conventional systems depending heavily on fossil fuel and other capital-intensive inputs. The system of rice intensification (SRI) developed in Madagascar can raise irrigated rice yields to about double the present world average without relying on external inputs, also offering environmental and equity benefits. SRI methods change they way plants, soil, water and nutrients are managed—rather than utilising new-variety seeds, inorganic fertilisers or other agrochemicals. SRI also reduces the need for irrigation water by about half and diminishes the requirements for capital and seed. SRI requires more knowledge and skill on the part of farmers and initially more labour per hectare. But greater labour intensity is compensated by farmers achieving higher returns for labour, and SRI can become labour-saving. SRI should make irrigated rice production more sustainable, as well as profitable. SRI experience may reveal other opportunities that can make agricultural systems more productive and beneficial for the long term. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Large-scale gravity-fed irrigation projects in Monsoon Asia have been for some years described in irrigation literature as ‘anarchy-ridden’, which threatens the sustainability of irrigation investment and lowers farmers' incomes. The literature attributed anarchy in the systems to farmers' opportunistic behaviour and corrup tion and inefficiency among irrigation officials. One major strategy suggested in irrigation literature to address this twin problem is to establish farmer organizations, which would mobilize farmers to participate collectively in irrigation management and also to check irrigation agency irregularities. This article examines the veracity of this model in a comparative context, by looking at five major irrigation systems in Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. Although the study found some evidence to support this model, it however overwhelmingly shows that irrigation agencies have often to deal more with inappropriate technology and faulty con structions, water scarcity and poor water distribution planning, than with farmers' opportunistic behaviour. In fact, farmers have developed their own methods of mitigating adverse impacts of shortages and poor deliveries of water, which could hardly be labelled as ‘anarchic’. © 2004, Sage Publications.

Farming styles refer to specific farming strategies, which are conscious responses of farmers to the prevailing ecological and socioeconomic conditions. The specific objectives of the study were to identify and characterize styles of farming in the Dzindi community of smallholders, to provide an understanding of the different styles from a smallholder perspective, and to interpret the meaning of the findings for smallholder development policy. Data collection involved both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three main farming styles were identified, and in each of these farmers employed particular strategies, which were congruent with their farming objectives, and which represented different degrees of exposure to risk evidenced by the crop selection, the amount of land they planted, the service providers they used with specific reference to land preparation, the social networks they maintained, especially with regard to marketing produce, the labour they hired and the farming requisites they purchased and utilised. The findings suggest that the response by farmers in the different styles to contemporary agricultural and related policy aimed at their empowerment and commercialisation is unlikely to be uniform, and this is expected to dilute the impact of policy measures in support of specific development trajectories.},

	abstract = {The consumption of a cotton product is connected to a chain of impacts on the water resources in the countries where cotton is grown and processed. The aim of this paper is to assess the 'water footprint' of worldwide cotton consumption, identifying both the location and the character of the impacts. The study distinguishes between three types of impact: evaporation of infiltrated rainwater for cotton growth (green water use), withdrawal of ground- or surface water for irrigation or processing (blue water use) and water pollution during growth or processing. The latter impact is quantified in terms of the dilution volume necessary to assimilate the pollution. For the period 1997-2001 the study shows that the worldwide consumption of cotton products requires 256 Gm3 of water per year, out of which about 42% is blue water, 39% green water and 19% dilution water. Impacts are typically cross-border. About 84% of the water footprint of cotton consumption in the EU25 region is located outside Europe, with major impacts particularly in India and Uzbekistan. Given the general lack of proper water pricing mechanisms or other ways of transmitting production-information, cotton consumers have little incentive to take responsibility for the impacts on remote water systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A model is formulated of the dynamic system of surface water and groundwater in the delta with water demand, groundwater extraction cost and stochastic recharge and surface water availability. The optimal pumping/artificial recharge policies for each state of the joint surfarce water and groundwater system is derived for the southern part of the delta and this policy is applied over a large number of years to derive the expected development over time of extraction/artificial recharge and the state of the groundwater system. The implications of the optimal pumpingl/artificial recharge policy for any review of existing allocations of surface water and groundwater are discussed.},

It is argued that policies towards strengthening the resource base (replenishment mechanisms) and equitable distribution of the resource (property rights) would be beneficial, economically as well as ecologically. The analysis is in favour of investment in replenishment mechanisms such as irrigation tanks and percolation tanks. The situation of over extraction and the resultant environmental degradation is a consequence of lack of appropriate and adequate policies (policy failure) for managing the subsurface water resources. Hitherto, groundwater policies (subsidized credit, power, etc.) are in the nature of encouraging private initiatives in groundwater development.

Vital statistics were used as a supplementary indicator of environmental conditions in the region. By comparing the data for provinces with each other and the data on Azerbaijan average, we have classified the provinces into 4 groups according to specific combinations of the indicators. Each group of provinces has distinctive environmental conditions and features for sustainable development. The classification makes it possible to develop certain recommendations for the regional sustainable development. Measures to be implemented within the Azerbaijan State Program on Social and Economic Development of Regions are also discussed. In the Khachmaz province, production of ecologically pure products is highly recommended. Special attention should be given to the development of tourism and recreational institutions in the Khachmaz, Khizi and Devechi provinces. Recommendations for these provinces include further development of industry on the basis of modern safe technologies. The irrigation and drainage networks should be reconstructed. The reconstruction will make it possible to reduce water loss and to increase the productivity of agriculture. In the Absheron province, Baku and Sumgait cities environmental systems are overloaded, and so the works at highly polluting enterprises must be stopped, the enterprises have to be re-equipped (old filters must be changed first of all) or relocated from the area (a decrease of environmental risk should be in the focus of attention). For improving of air quality, green areas should increase. There is a need to reduce urban traffic density and to reconstruct highways. Use of old vehicles must be forbidden or restricted, and transition to environmentally friendly fuel should be supported in every way possible. It is necessary to bring the waste management system and sanitary landfills up to international standards, and to improve the water supply and sewerage systems. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

The yield data shows an increasing long-term growth trend throughout the Green Revolution period in irrigated states where modern variety (MV) adoption was nearly complete. However, yield advances started to slow down for intensive irrigated rice systems in the 1990s, whereas rainfed ecosystems have increased during the late Green Revolution period. The domestic spillovers of MV from irrigated to rainfed states is likely to be one of the contributing factors to increased TFP growth in ranifed areas after the 1980s. This implies that the MV of rice developed for irrigated ecosystems have also benefited substantially the rainfed-dominant eastern Indian states in the long run where partial irrigation facilities such as shallow tube wells were created after the mid-1980s. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Institute of Developing Economies.},

Tree crops are thought to provide not only an effective remediation solution but also a desirable rural landscape in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Economic incentives can contribute to the economic viability of dendroremediation of reclaimed water in the WUI. A modified Faustmann optimization model has been applied to address the dendroremediation of municipal wastewater under Eucalyptus grandis coppice systems. Results suggest that each $1 kg-1 N increase in the dendroremediation incentive increases forestland value by $223-376 ha-1 ($90-152 acre-1), depending on the interest rate and site productivity. Profitability is highly sensitive to the cost of irrigation and the growth function, both of which might be controllable. Accounting for the dendroremediation service as a flow benefit rather than a stock benefit increases net returns by $61-64 ha-1 ($25-26 acre -1) and $138-148 ha-1 ($56-60 acre -1) assuming dendroremediation incentives of $1.50 and $3.50 kg-1 N, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that the drought imposed significant costs on farmers, but show also that water managers partly exacerbated these costs by allocating excessive amounts of water to irrigators in the abundant years. The model is also used to evaluate the benefits of a perfect water supply forecast and to simulate the economic gains of a voluntary water banking scheme. Results show that the benefits resulting from the perfect forecast of water supply 1 year ahead would represent a relative gain of 5%. However, a voluntary banking system would allow farmers to increase their benefits by 32-82% depending on the supply system. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Conversely, mounting empirical evidence suggests that irrigation externalities might preclude long-term sustainability of arable agriculture. Choosing between intensive irrigation schemes and less intensive farming systems is therefore, problematic. The paper examines the implications of irrigation intensification in south-eastern Nigeria using adjacent rain-fed farms as the counterfactual. The analyses found mixed results. When first introduced, the irrigation scheme increased marginal factor productivity and gross margins but this has subsequently declined to the extent that the marginal factor product of land has become negative. The annual yields of the irrigated farms were also less stable than those of the less intensive rain-fed farms. These results indicate the dilemma that irrigation externalities present to sustainable agricultural policy and suggest a need to look again at the potential for developments in rain-fed systems. © Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {Namibia is currently in the process of phasing out water subsidies in its governmentsponsored irrigation schemes. However, the financial effects on the affected farmers are frequently unclear, and so are the economic effects on society as a whole. The net back method provides a framework for estimating rough values of irrigation water in situations such as those in Namibian agriculture, where farmers face a number of constraints which are difficult to model explicitly due to the dearth of reliable data. We apply the net back method to estimate the value of irrigation water used for different crop alternatives in the Hardap region in southern Namibia. We find that all the crop alternatives, which farmers in the region currently choose between, will remain financially viable after the increases in user charges which are envisaged in the near future. However, substantial shifts in agricultural production will become necessary once the long term cost recovery policies are in place in the water sector. We also extend the net back framework in order to study potential effects of further increases in water user charges, which may become necessary in future as the water demand from other water users increases.},

The Wastewater Reuse Importance Model (WRIM) was then used to evaluate the importance of wastewater reuse in water resources balance based on a scoring procedure in which the amount of reusable wastewater was compared with various scenarios of irrigation shortages and needs. The models were applied to 82 municipal districts from the prefecture of Heraklion in the island of Crete. WRBM evaluated eight districts as water scarce while 72% of the districts are water adequate. WRIM evaluated that in 67% of the districts, wastewater reuse is incapable of playing any role of any importance since either water is adequate or the shortage is so great and/or the produced wastewater volume is insignificant by comparison. In total, in only 11 of the districts could wastewater reuse be considered as an important alternative water resource. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {According to some non-scholarly reports, Kalametiya lagoon (dry zone of southern Sri Lanka, formerly 8.9 km2, now 7.5 km2) had been a moderately or high salinity water body and a very important centre of prawn fishery until the late 1960s. Most of the lagoon area had remained open water until then. An upstream irrigation project, the Udawalawa irrigation scheme, came into operation in 1967, increasing the freshwater inflow to the lagoon. The flora, fauna and water quality of the lagoon was reported to have changed since then. The lagoon now is a shallow coastal water body with low salinity water. More than 75% of the lagoon is covered by freshwater species or mangrove species characteristic for water with a low salinity: Eichhornia crassipes, Typha latifolia resp. Sonneratia caseolaris. There is actually no commercially important fishery in the lagoon. The present study was carried out to assess scientifically the said changes in the vegetation within a GIS, using aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 1994 and IRS IC, PAN + LISS III satellite images of 1997 in combination with ground surveys and information from a questionnaire-based survey. It appeared from this work that the aerial cover by Sonneratia caseolaris has increased by more than 30 times over the period from 1956 to the recent dates. Also, the lagoon area with open water has been drastically reduced during the same period as a result of spreading of freshwater and low salinity plant species. The results strongly suggest that the locally reported changes (fisheries decline, water salinity decrease) can be corroborated by the observed profound changes in plant cover and that upstream water works may have had strong impacts on this ecosystem, thus causing these changes. This study couples data obtained from retrospective aerial photograph series, from spaceborne imaging, from actual ground surveys and from questionnaires amongst elderly people to reconstruct decadal environmental change, thus attempting to fill the gap of lacking historical environmental data.},
