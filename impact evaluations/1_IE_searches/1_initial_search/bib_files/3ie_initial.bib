Our instrumental variable estimates exploit the fact that river gradient affects a district's suitability for dams. In districts located downstream from a dam, agricultural production increases, and vulnerability to rainfall shocks declines. In contrast, agricultural production shows an insignificant increase in the district where the dam is located but its volatility increases. Rural poverty declines in downstream districts but increases in the district where the dam is built, suggesting that neither markets nor state institutions have alleviated the adverse distributional impacts of dam construction.},

abstract = {Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit–2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers' participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Akudugu:249285,
abstract = {Agriculture in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers who mostly undertake rain-fed agriculture. Unfortunately, the current trends of unpredictable rainfall patterns is putting the livelihoods of these smallholder farmers under threat. To overcome this threat, governments across Africa relentlessly invest in water harvesting strategies for irrigation purposes. Thus, the provision of irrigation facilities in strategic locations across Africa is deemed an important component of the agricultural transformation agenda being pursued in the continent. This paper therefore examines the role of irrigation in transforming smallholder agriculture in Africa by assessing the different impact pathways of irrigation, using Ghana as the case. The paper employs mixed methods that provide the opportunity for triangulation and cross validation. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus group discussions, key informant interviews and household survey questionnaires. The impacts of irrigation were analysed using propensity score matching (PSM) and narrations. The results indicate that irrigation has significant and positive impacts on farm output, income, employment, consumption, food security and non-farm businesses. The impacts of irrigation on health and environmental sustainability are mixed - the positive being the ability of irrigators to pay for improved healthcare for themselves and their families and the negatives include the outbreak of waterborne diseases associated with irrigation water. Construction of irrigation facilities causes destruction to the environment but improves provisioning ecosystem services. It is generally concluded that access to irrigation is associated with higher farm outputs, income levels, employment, consumption, food security, and engagement in non-farm business activities.},

abstract = {In China, a major agricultural challenge is the sub-optimal use of fertilizer and the environmental effects associated with overuse. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is addressing this problem by instituting farmer field schools (FFS), but this initiative has not been rigorously evaluated. We used a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the FFS program in five counties in Anhui and Hebei provinces, for rice and tomato crops, respectively. We used a matched pair random assignment of villages into treatment and control groups, and we randomized additional farmers into an 'exposed' group to study diffusion effects. We found no significant effects of the FFS intervention on mean fertilizer use for either crop. However, we found that fertilizer usage is highly heterogeneous, and a simple comparison of means masks the differential response to the FFS programme at either end of the distribution. For rice farmers, the percentage increase in nitrogen fertilizer usage at the lowest quintile is significantly higher for the treatment group than that for the control group, with a less pronounced drop in usage in the highest quintile. Ordinary least squares and instrumental variables regressions confirm that the distance from the prescribed optimum fertilizer use for rice decreased due to the intervention. For tomato farmers, nitrogen use increased in the lowest quintile more in the treatment group than in the control group, but the reduction in the highest quintile in the control group was substantially higher than that in the treatment group. Overall we conclude that the FFS programme improved the optimal use of fertilizer for rice farmers but had insignificant effects for tomato growers. Given the inconclusive results, we conclude that policymakers should revisit plans to scale up FFS in China, paying special attention to crop specificity, heterogeneous implementation quality, and outcomes not limited to fertilizer usage.},

Additionally, CF in baby corn farming leads to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers (Urea and DAP).

abstract = {Management of common-pool resources in the absence of individual pricing can lead to suboptimal allocations. High-frequency data from three irrigation schemes in Mozambique reveal patterns consistent with water inefficiency. Farmers use the amount of water required at the most sensitive stage of production as a benchmark for all allocations in the crop cycle. We demonstrate that these rule-ofthumb approaches create scarcity at the plot level despite schemes having sufficient water to meet farmers' individual demands. We therefore explore the possibility of a feedback tool that visually communicates to farmers the potential to conserve by varying water applications at each stage of the crop cycle. To test the importance of tailoring the information to farmers' own settings, we randomize a set of farmers to also receive visualizations comparing water requirements with each farmer's water use in the same season of the previous year. The experiment fails to detect an additional effect of individualized comparative feedback relative to a general information treatment. Water measurement shows that the gains from correcting observed misallocations of water in terms of water savings and avoided scarcity is potentially large as a share of water used in the agricultural sector. These findings support additional testing of feedback tools to encourage water conservation but not the expensive investments that would be required to generate feedback based on individual metering for all targeted farmers.},

@techreport{Benyishay2019,
abstract = {In 1996, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and several other donors embarked upon a bold experiment with the Government of Cambodia. They launched a program called "Seila," which means "foundation stone" in Khmer, to rebuild confidence in government institutions and improve economic welfare from the bottom up. The Cambodian population had been subjected to exceptionally high levels of predation, violence, and psychosocial trauma during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. The Khmer Rouge forcibly displaced millions of Cambodians to labor camps in the rural countryside during the late 1970s in order to advance the regime's goal of building a socialist, agrarian economy. Many of these laborers were worked to death, starved to death, or executed by agents of the state. Then, in 1979, Vietnam intervened militarily and helped install a new regime called the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Council (KPRC). The conflict, which displaced large numbers of civilians, continued until 1998 when Khmer Rouge ended the military fighting. Local government effectively ceased to function during this period of time. The events of the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s also severely eroded public trust in government institutions. Seila represented an attempt to rebuild public confidence in local government institutions. Its stated purpose was to "contribute to poverty reduction through local governance, and{\ldots} improve local governance by channeling funds to the sub-national level to allow locally elected leaders to respond to locally identified needs." It sought to achieve this goal by providing (1) grant financing for locally-managed public infrastructure projects, and (2) technical and financial support to build and strengthen institutions of decentralized governance (e.g. establishing local government bodies to identify priority infrastructure projects through local, participatory planning processes). Between 1996 and 2001, Seila's geographical reach expanded from 4 communes and sangkats to 218. The donor community then helped finance the nationwide expansion of the program between 2002 and 2010. They did so by 12 supporting the design and implementation of an inter-governmental transfer mechanism called Commune/Sangkat Fund (CSF) and a suite of accompanying decentralization reforms and capacitybuilding efforts that transitioned ownership of the CSF to the Cambodian authorities. After commune and sangkat (CS) elections were organized and CS council members were made legally responsible for village-level development projects, Sida and several other development partners invested in building the administrative capacities of CS councils. They provided CS council members with extensive training—in participatory budgeting and planning, project design, procurement, and financial accounting, among other things—and ongoing technical assistance from a team of 1700 civil servants in every one of the country's 24 provinces. During this period of time, the CSF decentralized the funding, selection, and management of small-scale economic infrastructure projects to local councils in every one of the country 1,621 communes and sangkats. The vast majority of these projects supported the construction and upgrading of rural roads, water supply systems, and irrigation dams and canals. The CSF is now fully funded and operated by the Cambodian authorities. The central government transfers approximately 3{\%} of the national budget each year to the CSF and this funding is allocated to communes and sangkats according to a formula (35{\%} weight assigned to population size, 30{\%} weight assigned to the poverty rate, and a 35{\%} fixed contribution). CS councils have completed more than 40,000 economic infrastructure projects to date, and neither Sida nor any other donor has directly funded the CSF since 2010. As such, the CSF represents a program that was launched and nurtured by Sida but eventually handed over to the local authorities and made sustainable. A 2002 Sida performance evaluation characterized Seila as "one of those rare instances when an internationally supported aid project starts as a geographically delimited area-based project and then evolves into a governmentowned programme with progressive and profound impact at a national level" (Rudengren and {\"{O}}jendal 2002). Moreover, the Seila pilot and CSF scale-up reflect a flagship investment by Sida, with long-term engagement focused on a 13 specific aspect of a partner country's development. The Government of Cambodia and donor community jointly invested nearly {\$}350 million in this program between 1996 and 2010. Sida itself provided approximately {\$}80 million over this period, while also helping to mobilize and coordinate counterpart contributions from more than a dozen bilateral and multilateral development partners as well as the Cambodian Government. This foreign aid program is also unlike many others in that it was successfully transitioned to full country ownership. Between 2011 and 2018, the Cambodian Government allocated roughly {\$}50 million each year— or roughly {\$}400 million to date—to sustain program implementation. In total, the Government of Cambodia and the donor community have invested around {\$}750 million in this program over a twenty-three-year period. Yet a rigorous impact evaluation of this program—with counterfactual evidence of what would have occurred in the absence of the program—has never been published. Cambodia achieved major economic development and poverty reduction gains during the period of program implementation. However, it remains unclear if the scale-up and institutionalization of this program contributed to these socioeconomic gains, or whether these gains were instead driven by other changes. Our evaluation fills this evidence gap. We employ a quasi-experimental panel framework to rigorously estimate the socioeconomic impacts of CSF projects. We rely on variation in the timing of CSF project completion in different villages within each commune to identify these impacts, while accounting for a variety of potential confounds at fine geographic levels. To do so, we construct a primary dataset with yearly treatment and outcome measures between 1992 and 2013 for 1 km square grid cells, using remotely sensed nighttime light output data as a proxy for local economic development. To extend our analysis to additional village-level development outcomes, we use administrative data collected by Cambodia's Ministry of Planning on an annual basis between 2008 and 2016. We find that the completion of CSF projects significantly increased economic development—as measured by nighttime light 14 output—in surrounding areas. We also find that rural transport projects are the main driver of these results, and that these impacts are particularly large in more densely populated rural areas. These impacts also appear to have grown over time, which suggests that rural road improvements increased not only the level but also the trajectory of economic development. Our analysis also reveals that that CSF projects reduced infant mortality, which indicates the economic development gains resulting from local infrastructure improvements were broadly shared by village residents. Direct program impacts on local governance are significantly more difficult to measure, as there are no reliable measures of village- or commune-level governance that are observed over time at sufficiently frequent intervals. However, there are several data sources that make it possible to evaluate whether pre-existing local governance conditions—and governance interventions undertaken during the early stages of program implementation—have resulted in larger or smaller CSF project impacts. It is important to keep in mind that program implementation took place under a very challenging set of circumstances. As described in a previous Sida evaluation, there was "a virtual absence of [local] government structures and [a] need to rebuild them from the ground up" (Blench et al. 2002: 14). Consequently, the architects of the Seila/CSF program placed special emphasis on rebuilding local government legitimacy and capacity through a foundational set of reforms and investments. After working with the Government of Cambodia to establish locally elected CS councils, they invested heavily in building the administrative capacities of individual CS council members. By creating a cadre of local administrators who were capable of addressing local development needs, they hoped to lay the groundwork for a longer-term process of rebuilding the social contract. Our evaluation results clearly indicate that the local capacity of CS councils was a key determinant of successful CSF project implementation. However, we do not find that program impacts were larger in areas where CS councils were more responsive to citizen priorities. Nor do we find larger project impacts in areas with high baseline levels of civic engagement. If anything, we find the 15 opposite to be true. These counterintuitive results call attention to a broader insight that merits consideration in future Sida programming: the importance of designing and sequencing decentralization programs in ways that are realistic and tailored to the local context. ...},

abstract = {Smallholder rice farming is central to poverty reduction, food security, and rural development in the Philippines. Currently, rice affordability is threatened by the country's protectionist approach to rice imports and low production efficiency. One key issue is that around 41 percent of the country's irrigable land is not irrigated. Moreover, many irrigation systems are suggested to be poorly managed with unequal water distribution. The Irrigated Rice Production Enhancement Project (IRPEP) was implemented in three regions (VI, VII and X) of the Philippines between 2010-2015. It was designed to improve rice productivity and smallholder livelihoods by strengthening canal irrigation infrastructure of Communal Irrigation Systems (CIS), improving the capacity of the Irrigators' Associations (IAs) that manage the CIS, and offering complementary marketing support, Farmer Field Schools, and emergency seed buffer stocks. As the government provides FFS and buffer stocks to farmers across the country, we focus the assessment on the irrigation and marketing activities only. We define the impact indicators based on IRPEP's theory of change, which maps the inputs and activities of the project to outcomes and impacts through various channels. The analysis is based on quantitative data from 2,104 households and 113 IAs covering beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups, along with qualitative data from project and IA staff. We estimate IRPEP's impact by comparing beneficiary and non-beneficiary households and IAs using statistical matching techniques to ensure a clean and unbaised comparison. We then use the qualitative data to try to identify the underlying factors that shaped the results. We particularly focus our analysis on regional heterogeneities in impacts because of the considerable differences between the three project regions. The main difference between regions stems from their varying levels of exposure to extreme weather events (e.g. super typhoons), as Region VIII, and to a lesser extent Region VI, experienced significant extreme weather damage during the project's implementation.},

The Propensity Score Matching model using logit estimate indicated that family size, credit access and subsidy with productive safety net program were found positive significant effect. The logit model discovered that sex, livestock holding size, dwelling distance from irrigation farm, and subsidy by productive safety net programme and credit access have determinant effect on decision participation in small-scale irrigation. Therefore, attention should be given by the government in expanding of modern irrigation practice and constructing improved storage house should be given priorities.Author(s)},

abstract = {The South African government has implemented homestead food garden (HFG) programmes directed at enhancing food production in order to reduce food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty and hunger. The present paper evaluated the impact of this programme on household food insecurity using surveys of 500 households. Endogenous switching regression, propensity score matching and household food insecurity average scores were employed in our analysis. Our findings demonstrated that participation in an HFG programme could significantly enhance the food security status of participants by increasing household food supply and consumption as well as by income derived from selling any excess production from the garden. Specifically, our empirical findings showed that participation in the HFG programme significantly reduced food insecurity among rural households by as much as 41.5{\%}. Therefore, we recommend that policy makers should encourage more rural households to participate in the programme in order to reduce their food insecurity. Facilitating easy access to credit, extension services, fertilizer, irrigation facilities and land are policy options needed to promote farmers participation in HFG programmes. Furthermore, the formation of farmer-based organizations and the building of positive perceptions about HFGs are some of the key policy options that can be employed to improve households{\^{a}}€™ participation in the programme. Promotion of education, participating in off-farm activities, access to market, irrigation, extension and credit, and adoption of fertiliser are some policy interventions that can reduce food insecurity among rural house holds whether or not they participate in the HFG programme.},

abstract = {We investigate the impacts of sustainable land management practices on soil carbon stocks and also impacts of soil carbon on the mean and variance of crop production using econometric tools. Using a cross-sectional plot-level dataset collected from three agroecological zones of Uganda with soil carbon measured at a depth of 0 to 15 centimeters, our results have robustly shown that irrigation, fertilizers, improved fallow, crop residues, mulching, and trash lines are positively and significantly associated with higher soil carbon, corroborating results from agronomic experiments. However, we found crop rotation associated with lower soil carbon, which has also been observed in some agronomic experiments. Soil carbon has shown a significant nonlinear effect on crop production with the threshold occurring at 29.96 milligrams of carbon per hectare, above which farmers start to see significant positive effects on crop production. Furthermore, we found soil carbon to be associated with lower variance of crop production; hence, soil carbon is an indicator of crop yield loss risk (soil carbon has a risk-reducing effect). These empirical results have demonstrated strong evidence for developing countries of the potential of sustainable land management practices to enhance carbon sequestration and also the potential of soil carbon to reduce production risk. The results have implications for the role that soil carbon can play in adaptation to climate change and provision of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Water scarcity is a severe and growing global challenge. Over the last 50 years, water withdrawals have tripled due to economic development and rapid population growth, placing serious pressure on the planet's water systems. Agriculture remains the most significant consumer of water, accounting for approximately 75{\%} of all global water use. Millions of rural agriculture-dependent farmers in Africa, Asia and the Middle East already face devastating shortages of irrigation water, a situation that will have severe implications for food security and economic development across the globe. Therefore, efficient irrigation water management is critical to meet the growing demand for water resources.My dissertation seeks to determine the impact of a development project committed to improving irrigation management in Kyrgyzstan. The research focused on the Water Users' Association Support Program (WUASP), a project dedicated to building the capacity of local institutions of irrigators known as Water Users' Association (WUAs) through social mobilization, institutional development and participatory rehabilitation. An interrupted panel design and fixed effects regression methods are used to isolate the program effect. Additionally, data from a large N probability survey is used to explore the program's association with four behavioral mechanisms – knowledge, participation, attitudes and social capital – that link WUASP to irrigation management outcomes. Furthermore, my quantitative methods are supplemented by qualitative data from focus groups, interviews and participant observation collected over nine months of field research.The results indicate that the program improved irrigation management outcomes; these results were mediated by a WUA's size, economic and social heterogeneity, as well as ecological scarcity. Moreover, the analysis points to a positive program association with the mechanisms of knowledge, participation and attitudes. However, there is no evidence of a positive effect for women or water users located at the end of a canal, and the program failed to generate a positive community dynamic over irrigation. Thus, while WUASP may have promoted efficiency gains among the elite or privileged groups, the findings suggest that in cases of significant economic inequality, the program either had no effect or may have inadvertently increased the disparity between powerful and powerless water users.},

An innovative data collection was put in place to study the impact on areas where a protracted drought was taking place. In particular, using panel data that allowed one to follow household over time, the analysis tested whether the irrigation schemes were able to provide a protective and sustained effect towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing smallholders households resilience capacity to cope with the longer term variability of the climatic shocks.},

abstract = {Climate change is a significant obstacle for farmers in the least developed countries like Afghanistan and adaptation support is exceptionally scarce. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers' adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers' access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers' self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that unmitigated risks provide a disincentive for otherwise optimal investments in modern farm inputs. Index insurance provides a means for managing risk without the burdens of asymmetric information and high transaction costs that plague traditional indemnity-based crop insurance programs. Yet many index insurance programs that have been piloted around the world have met with rather limited success, so the potential for insurance to foster more intensive agricultural production has yet to be realized. This study assesses both the demand for and the effectiveness of an innovative index insurance product designed to help smallholder farmers in Bangladesh manage risk to crop yields and the increased production costs associated with drought. Villages were randomized into either an insurance treatment or a comparison group, and discounts and rebates were randomly allocated across treatment villages to encourage insurance take-up and to allow for the estimation of the price elasticity of insurance demand. Among those offered insurance, we find insurance demand to be moderately price elastic, with discounts significantly more successful in stimulating demand than rebates. Farmers who are highly risk averse or sensitive to basis risk prefer a rebate to a discount, suggesting that the rebate may partially offset some of the implicit costs associated with insurance contract nonperformance. Having insurance yields both ex ante risk management effects and ex post income effects on agricultural input use. The risk management effects lead to increased expenditures on inputs during the aman rice-growing season, including expenditures for risky inputs such as fertilizers, as well as those for irrigation and pesticides. The income effects lead to increased seed expenditures during the boro rice-growing season, which may signal insured farmers{\^{a}}€™ higher rates of seed replacement, which broadens their access to technological improvements embodied in newer seeds as well as enhancing the genetic purity of cultivated seeds.},

The evaluation consists of a panel analysis of small scale farming households across 35 districts that bought a pump in 2009, 2011 and 2015. The pumps were mas-produced and marketed by KickStart and sold through local agri-vet shops across Kenya during all the years covered by the study. Impacts are measured as the difference at endline (2015) in outcomes between cohort 3 (purchasing pumps in 2015) and cohorts 1 and 2 (purchasing pumps in 2009 and 2011, respectively); hence we exploit the time variation in having access to the pump. The analysis provides qualitative evidence that the pumps allowed farmers to increase their incomes, however these impacts are not substantiated in quantitative analysis. It is therefore not possible to conclude from this analysis whether the pumps do or do not have positive impacts overall. The panel approach, however, suffers from several limitations, most notably pre- existing differences across cohorts. An upcoming randomized control trail will likely provide conclusive answers regarding the impacts of these irrigation pumps.},

abstract = {The new fertilizer subsidies in sub-Saharan Africa are intended to increase agricultural production and ensure development of a fertilizer market. Fertilizer adoption requires complementary inputs, such as investment in soil and water conservation (SWC), for efficient and optimal nutrient uptake, and many fertilizer subsidy programs implicitly assume that fertilizer subsidies crowd in such investments. The results of our study of the impact of fertilizer subsidies on SWC efforts in Ghana indicate that beneficiaries of the program do not invest significantly more in SWC. This suggests that policies should not expect farmers to respond to fertilizer subsidies with substantial investment in SWC. Thus, in order to achieve increased investment in SWC for sustainable agricultural development, more comprehensive measures that include fertilizer investments explicitly (such as integrated soil fertility management programs) may be needed.},

This intervention invested in irrigation infrastructure construction, Water Users Association development, and agricultural technology extension. The Impact Evaluation (IE) was based on comparison of farm plots and farm households within MLIIP areas which were expected to be affected in different ways, and comparable farm plots and farm households in neighbouring irrigation schemes not subject to the intervention. The IE focussed on the Mae Lao irrigation project (Mae Lao), and the comparison areas are within the Chiang Rai, Tamwok and Chaisombat irrigation projects. Fieldwork during the study suggests that the design was partly confounded by parallel interventions made by RID in the non-intervention schemes; all schemes appear to have received some intervention during the study reference period (2000-2010). Nevertheless, the study research included a recall component providing some before- after comparison. Although we find some perceived improvement in sufficiency and quality of water supply, and areas irrigated, these are no greater on Mae Lao than on the comparison schemes, especially Chiang Rai. We found no improvements in rice crop productivity that we could identify with the intervention. Thus the impact evaluation has been vitiated by contamination of the control group which had access to alternative interventions funded directly by the Government of Thailand. Impact evaluations using ex-post observational data are exceptionally problematic especially when access has to be negotiated through organisations which have not taken ownership of the evaluation, and, or may be implicated in the outcome of the evaluation.},

abstract = {This paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation in community-managed water user associations, in a context where assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these institutions existed before training began. We also examine whether participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm operations to other workers, in a context where only managers have been directly trained, almost all managers are male, and females are increasingly operating farms. We collected microdata from 1855 farms in Southern Tajikistan, where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training, while those in the other 40 received shorter training. These {\^{a}}€˜treatment{\^{a}}€™ and {\^{a}}€˜control{\^{a}}€™ subdistricts were selected by constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to training duration. Farms were then selected from a census using a stratified random sampling process. A difference-in-difference technique with right-hand-side covariates is employed, where both sets of data were collected after training was completed. This choice of econometric methods controls against farm-level selection effects, but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error. Longer training has a causal effect on increasing participation in WUAs. Results also demonstrate that when male workers not directly trained operate farms, participation is not affected; however, participation is negatively affected when female workers operate farms. These results provide evidence for designing irrigation management programs to target female workers directly, in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on active farm participation.},

@techreport{Filipski2017,
abstract = {Executive summary- Ethiopia has long suffered from chronic food security issues, most dramatically revealed in the tragic 1983-1984 famine. The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) was designed as a large-scale and long-term coordinated effort to fight food insecurity throughout the country. The program, launched in 2005, falls in the 'cash for work' category: poor members of the community can receive small transfers in exchange for working on projects in their community. It is the largest program of its kind in Africa, reaching more than 8 million Ethiopians, about 10 per cent of the population. The dual nature of the PSNP, combining the delivery of safety net protection with the creation of productive assets in the community, means that its impacts are multifaceted, as are the channels through which they operate. At the same time, it has the potential to profoundly affect the agro-ecology of targeted areas. The impacts of the PSNP have been insufficiently studied. Research has focused on the benefits the cash or food transfer has provided to its recipients. We know very little about whether the PSNP has done anything to spark local economic growth, i.e. whether the broader 'productive' goal of the PSNP has met with any success. The PSNP might stimulate growth by loosening investment constraints in beneficiary households, but could also do so through local income multipliers and the creation of public goods (for instance, irrigation, land conservation) that lead to productivity gains, which in turn can create local income multipliers of their own. Past studies have not addressed impacts beyond the beneficiary households. This report is part of an extensive effort to fill this lacuna. We aim to evaluate the impacts of the PSNP beyond the recipients of the cash transfer, both in terms of the local spillovers created by the cash transfer and the impacts of community assets on the local, regional, and national economies. The goal of the project is to apply a comprehensive micro-macro approach to evaluate the full impact of the PSNP. We develop a methodology bridging case studies, econometric evaluations, modeling and simulation approaches to capture the local economic linkages, identify the causal chains in program impacts, and evaluate the full impact of the program at the local and national scales. Case studies allow us to capture context-specific variations in the implementation of PSNP projects on the ground, and a window into the corresponding impact channels. We studied eight kebeles in depth (two in each of four woredas). In each kebele we administered a PSNP-focused community survey and a business survey, and visited the sites of 21 different PSNP projects. Case study analysis suggests that soil and water conservation projects improve agricultural yields and increase availability of water for cattle. Tree projects participate in the conservation of soil and water, while also providing construction materials and business opportunities. Irrigation projects improve yields and allow high-value crops to be grown. To build upon case study insights, we use econometrics to precisely estimate the average size of project impacts and demonstrate causality. We find a 2.8 per cent increase in grain yields that is statistically significant at the .01 level. This impact is interpreted as an average yearly effect in the zones in which a soil and water conservation project was implemented. We also estimate that PSNP irrigation projects lead to 12 per cent growth in vegetable yields on a per-project basis. Yield growth resulting from the PSNP, in turn, can lead to economic growth, a process that we simulate using an economy-wide model. We couple this with simulations of a transfer to eligible households (estimated to be 18 per cent of their income). This provides a simulation estimate of the simultaneous impacts of the productive and safety net components of the PSNP. At the local scale, we use a local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) model to simulate the PSNP and evaluate its local economy-wide impacts (Taylor and Filipski, 2014). Eight LEWIE models (one for each kebele) reveal substantial local economy-wide impacts of the PSNP, with income and production multipliers of up to 2.4 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) per ETB transferred. Nevertheless, the program multipliers vary considerably across locales, and they can include both positive and negative spillovers for nonrecipient households. Spillover size is determined by the structure of each local economy, the types of activities households engage in, and in particular the degree to which the community is integrated with outside markets. Although the target kebeles are remote, their economies are not completely isolated from the rest of the country. This means that some of the benefits of the PSNP spill out of the kebele and into the rest of the country, for instance through trade, such as when beneficiary households purchase items outside of their kebele. Given the scale of the program, the aggregation of all these spillovers can be large enough to impact national markets. Therefore, we also conduct simulations at the Ethiopia-wide scale. Simulating the PSNP at the national scale with a computable general equilibrium model reveals that the program creates sizeable nationwide spillovers. This reflects the unusual size and scope of the PSNP, the largest program of its kind in Africa. While PSNP areas see the largest income benefits in percentage terms (6 per cent of household income), the rest of the country experiences real income benefits of up to 2 per cent as a result of the PSNP's impacts on supply, demand, wages, and prices. We find that the program increases national value added by 0.99 per cent. This comprehensive approach to evaluating the impacts of the PSNP suggests that the effects of the program beyond the recipient households are far from negligible. Recognizing the broader impacts of the PSNP can change the way we evaluate and think about the economic costs and benefits of the program.},

abstract = {Adoption of technology is indispensable for increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to credit is often identified as a constraint on the adoption of agricul- tural technology. Recently, microcredit has generated considerable enthusiasm and hope for ensuring sustainable financial inclusion of the poor. We conducted randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the impact of microcredit on the adoption of technology and productivity of rice cultivation in Tanzania. Collaboratively with BRAC, a globally-known microfinance institution, we offered microcredit specifically designed for agriculture to randomly selected farmers. We estimate the intention-to-treat effect (ITT) as well as the local average treatment effect (LATE) of microcredit, by using the treatment sta- tus as an instrumental variable (IV). Overall, we find no evidence that the BRAC program increases the use of chemical fertilizer. Also, credit use does not result in an increase in paddy yield, profit from rice cul- tivation, or household income. Our results from sub-sample analyses suggest that credit does not increase the fertilizer use by those who have better access to irrigation water as they have already applied the amount of fertilizer near to the recommended level. On the other hand, credit increases the fertilizer use by those who have limited access to irrigation water and have previously used little fertilizer. However, possibly due to the poor yield response to fertilizer, the increase in chemical fertilizer use does not result in higher yield for them. We also observed similar phenomenon for the comparison between trained and non-trained borrowers before the intervention. Our study suggests that improving credit access may not be enough to increase small-scale farmers{\^{a}}€™ technology adoption, agricultural productivity, and welfare.},

abstract = {In Vietnam, all lands belong to the state, who assigns usufruct rights to those lands to individuals and households. In 1993, the state gave 20-year usufruct rights to growers of annual crops, and 50-year usufruct rights to growers of perennial crops. In 2013, as the usufruct rights of growers of annual crops were set to expire, the Vietnamese government passed a law—the Land Law of 2013—that extended the usufruct rights of all landowners by 50 years. We exploit this largely unanticipated shock to study the effect of the Land Law of 2013 on the investment behaviour of growers of annual crops. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the Land Law of 2013 is associated with a higher likelihood of investment in irrigation technology or soil and water conservation, but not other types of investment. Our results are robust to controlling for endogenous switching from annual to perennial crops, and our data support the parallel trends assumption. Our results also suggest that the long-term effects of the Land Law of 2013 are larger than its short-term effects.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in developing countries often lack appropriate cereal storage facilities which can contribute to food insecurity and low cereal commercialization, particularly when they can only rely on one cropping season with no irrigation. Lack of quality storage can lead to post-harvest losses (Abass et al, 2014; Sheahan and Barrett, 2017) and often compels smallholder farmers to sell their crops soon after harvest, when crop prices are at their seasonal lowest, only for them to buy grain for consumption during the lean season, when prices are high (Kadjo et al, 2018; Aggarwal et al, 2018; Stephens and Barrett, 2011). In many instances, such farmers need food assistance to survive the lean season and in other cases, they may have to borrow money at usurious rates in order to purchase food. This was the case in Gu{\'{e}}ra Region of Chad, a semi-arid area that frequently experiences droughts and dry spells in ways that severely reduce crop production and rural households' food security. To address these issues, the IFAD-funded Programme d'Appui au D{\'{e}}veloppement Rural dans le Gu{\'{e}}ra (PADER-G) project was implemented with the main objective of supporting poor rural households and smallholder farmers in Gu{\'{e}}ra, Chad to improve their food security and livelihoods. One specific aim of PADER-G, designed to manage risks of food shortage, was to improve cereal storage among smallholder farmers through the construction of community cereal banks (banque de c{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}ales). This main element of the project was complemented with the establishment of community committees (Comit{\'{e}} de gestion des banques de soudure – COGES) which were trained on effective management of the cereal banks.},

abstract = {India is one of the largest jute producing country. Jute is an eco-friendly crop; extensively grown at commercial scale in the province of West Bengal in India. West Bengal tops the list in respect of yield generation out of all of the states of India. Jute production is labour intensive and provides subsistence to millions of farm-families. In order to expedite jute production, various government and non-government agencies, in West Bengal, are actively working to transfer the protocol of improved cultivation strategy and field based practical knowledge to jute farmers. Therefore, an attempt has been made to assess the improvement of knowledge and cultivation practices due to the adoption of recommended technologies following training and demonstration programme. In the present study beneficiary farmers are considered as 'experimental group' and non-beneficiaries as a 'control group'. It is clearly observed from this study that beneficiary farmers achieved higher knowledge and adoption level than non-beneficiaries in different farming technology and practice. Knowledge and adoption levels of beneficiary farmers in use of high yielding varieties, land preparation, seed treatment, suggested composite, plant protection measures, irrigation, method of pesticide application, retting procedure and fibre extraction were 100, 95, 80, 95, 95, 100, 90, 90 and 80 per cent and 100, 75, 60, 85, 85, 95, 80, 85 and 60 per cent respectably. On the other hand knowledge and adoption level in nonbeneficiaries were 100, 100, 70, 90, 90, 100, 70, 90 and 70 per cent and 60, 50, 40, 70, 70, 80, 60, 90 and 60 percent respectably. In the present study the impact of training and demonstration to the farmers to adopt the technology bases tools including cultural protocol was 17.87 per cent over the existing knowledge and management practices. It can be thus safely concluded from observation that there is significant role of farm-training in promotion of improved production practices of jute and ensuring their adoption. Substantial impact of training over the existing knowledge and adoption of the beneficiary farmers than the non-beneficiary farmers was also observed.},

While extensive efforts are going on in constructing and providing smallholder farmers with water harvesting structures, such as ponds in Rwanda, there is limited knowledge of the factors that influence adoption of such structures and their impact on households' input use and farm income. This study applied propensity score matching technique to assess the impact of rainwater harvesting ponds on farm income of small scale farmers in Rwanda. The study also assesses the factors that influence adoption of rainwater harvesting ponds by using a binary logit model. Results show that households with rainwater harvesting ponds are significantly better off in terms of achieving higher income than those without ponds, even though they are comparable in essential household characteristics. The study finds that household size, physical and financial asset endowments, group membership are significant in explaining the household decision to adopt rainwater harvesting ponds. It discusses the implications of these findings for policy.},

abstract = {This article evaluates the impacts of a controlled irrigation technique in rice production called alternate wetting and drying (AWD). Propensity score matching (PSM) and regression-based approaches applied to farm-level survey data are used to achieve the objective of the study. The PSM and regression-based approach accounts for the potential bias due to selection problems from observable variables. Results of the impact analysis using both empirical approaches indicate that AWD, particularly the ''Safe AWD'' variant, reduces the hours of irrigation use (by about 38{\%}), without a statistically significant reduction in yields and profits. This reduction in irrigation time translates to corresponding savings in the amount of irrigation water and pumping energy used. However, further analysis of the impact estimates suggests that the potential magnitude of the selection bias based on unobservable variables may still be able to eliminate the measured impact from the PSM and regression-based techniques that only control for selection based on observable variables. Hence, the current impact results have to be interpreted with caution and further data collection is needed to construct a panel data that would allow one to account for selection problems due to unobservable variables and, consequently, better estimate the AWD impact.},

abstract = {The conventional tillage based rice-wheat system (RWS) in Indo-genetic plains (IGP) of South Asia is facing diverse challenges like increase in production cost and erratic climatic events. This results in stagnated crop productivity and declined farm profitability with increased emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, 3-year multi-location farmer's participatory research trial was conducted to assess the impact of crop establishment and residue management techniques on crop productivity, economic profitability and environmental footprints in RWS. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of combinations of improved agronomic technologies compared to farmer's practices (FP) on crop productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency and environmental footprints. The experiment had six scenarios that is, S1-Farmer's practice; Conventional tillage (CT) without residue; S2-CT with residue, S3- Reduced tillage (RT) with residue + Recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF); S4-RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, S5-ZT with residue + RDF + green seeker + tensiometer + information {\&} communication technology + crop insurance and S6- S5 + site specific nutrient management. Climate smart agriculture practices (CSAPs; mean of S4, S5 and S6) increase system productivity and farm profitability by 10.5{\%} and 29.4{\%} (on 3 yrs' mean basis), whereas, improved farmers practices (mean of S2 and S3) resulted in only 3.2{\%} and 5.3{\%} increments compared to farmer's practice (S1), respectively. On an average, CSAPs saved 39.3{\%} of irrigation water and enhanced the irrigation and total water productivity by 53.9{\%} and 18.4{\%} than FP, respectively. In all the 3-years, CSAPs with high adaptive measures enhanced the energy-use-efficiency (EUE) and energy productivity (EP) by 43{\%}-54{\%} and 44{\%}-61{\%}, respectively than FP. In our study, global warming potential (GWP), GHG emission due to consumption energy and greenhouse gas intensity were recorded lower by 43{\%}, 56{\%} and 59{\%} in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) with high adaptive measures than farmers practices (3652.7 kg CO2 eq. ha-1 yr-1, 722.2 kg CO2 eq. ha-1 yr-1 and 718.7 Mg kg-1 CO2 eq. ha-1 yr-1). The findings of the present study revealed that CSA with adaption of innovative measures (S6) improved 3-year mean system productivity by 10.5{\%}, profitability by 29.4{\%}, water productivity and energy productivity by 18.3{\%} and 48.9{\%}, respectively than FP. Thus, the results of our 3-year farmer's participatory study suggest that in a RW system, climate smart agriculture practices have better adaptive capacity and could be a feasible option for attaining higher yields, farm profitability, energy-use efficiency and water productivity with sustained/improved environmental quality in smallholder production systems of Eastern IGP of India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia. Finally, the adoption of these CSAPs should be promoted in the RW rotation of IGP to ensure food security, restoration of soil health and to mitigate climate change, the key sustainable development goals (SDGs).},

abstract = {Irrigation projects in sub-Saharan Africa are mostly unsustainable because of lack of maintenance by their users or government planners. By contrast, evidence shows that the smallholder farmers are developing and expanding the irrigated land, using their initiatives. Farmer-led irrigation, a revolutionary agricultural intensification approach, is already in progress with the magnitude to significantly transform the living standards of smallholder farmers. However, a rigorous assessment of its impact on household welfare to ascertain this is lacking. This paper bridges this gap by assessing factors influencing the adoption of this particular approach as well as its effects on the farmers' per capita net crop income. Our data set consists of 608 smallholder farmers in Southern Tanzania and used propensity score matching to estimate the effects of adoption on the per capita net crop income. Our results indicate that the uptake of farmer-led irrigation practices is influenced by drought experience, water user group membership, farmer organization membership, and government extension, as well as the sex of the household head. Further, there was a positive and significant effect on the adopters' per capita net crop income, thus encouraging the need to promote farmer-led irrigation as a complement to externally promoted innovations in achieving sustainable food security. This study, therefore, recommends that the government should support the farmers' initiative by improving roads, removing market barriers, and helping farmers who have not yet taken up the initiative. Also, the government should enact regulations to make sure farmer-led irrigation initiatives do not harm the eco-environment such as protecting domestic water users. Finally, the government should leverage microservices to the farmers such as promoting affordable and appropriate credit facilities. It is necessary to continue pursuing this vein of research to gain information regarding the definite impact of the farmer-led irrigation on household welfare.},

abstract = {Like many other South and Southeast Asian countries, different national and international organizations are actively promoting integrated rice-fish farming system (IRFFS) as a potential technique to alleviate poverty, food and nutrition insecurity in different parts of Bangladesh, since 1990s. However, little rigorous empirical research exists on the determinants of adoption and welfare impact of such technologies, particularly in marginalized people's settings. This article addresses this research gap, using the case of indigenous small-scale IRFFS farm households' cross-sectional survey data from northern and northwestern regions of Bangladesh. It employs double hurdle model for determining the factors affecting IRFFS adoption and intensity of adoption in the first stage and propensity score-matching (PSM) method to analyze the causal impact of IRFFS adoption on welfare of marginalized indigenous farm households in Bangladesh in the second stage. The findings of the first stage study indicate that among the key determinants of adoption are gender of the household head, access to irrigation, education and conflict with villagers. The results also show that farm size and access to credit play a significant role in the extent of adoption, implying land and credit constraints; hence, it can be difficult for land and credit constraint farmers to extend the adoption of the technology. In the second stage the study shows that IRFFS has a robust positive and significant impact on farm household welfare measured by household annual income, farm income, and quantity and frequency of fish consumption. Overall, the article provides evidence that promoting IRFFS technology is important to improve welfare of rural people especially for marginalized poor indigenous small-scale rural farm households in Bangladesh. But necessary interventions are needed to overcome the inhibiting factors for more widespread adoption of this promising technology.},

Two rounds of balanced panel data for the production seasons 2009/2010 and 2014/2015 collected from 407 smallholder farmers were analysed. Correlated random effect double hurdle models are used to estimate participation and extent of involvement in irrigated agriculture. The household fixed effect with a control function approach was used to assess the impact of participating in irrigated agriculture on welfare outcomes. The double hurdle model results indicate that households with at least one plot owned and located within the irrigation command area positively and significantly affect participation in irrigated agriculture. The fixed-effect model results also revealed that the area planted with use of irrigation enables smallholders to grow crops more than once a year; to ensure increased and stable production, income, consumption and asset accumulation positively. The finding of this study confirms that the potential role of irrigated agriculture is not limited to improving crop income and consumption of rural households, but also higher production from irrigated agriculture generates surplus products and better chance to integrate with the output market.},

abstract = {Purpose Recent studies suggest extensive use of environmental resources in agrofarming degrades ecosystem significantly. In this backdrop, this study aims at assessing ecoefficiency of paddy farming. Because ecoefficiency links up between economic performances and environmental resources supporting the provision of goods and services for the society, this study further investigates the effectiveness of attending Farmers' Field School (FFS), an agroenvironmental program, in conserving environmental resources through improving farm-level ecoefficiency. Design/methodology/approach In a dataset of 200 randomly selected paddy farmers from three districts of the southwestern Bangladesh, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to compute both radial and pressure-specific (nutrient balance, energy balance, irrigation and pesticide lethal risk) ecoefficiency scores. Furthermore, propensity score matching (PSM) technique is applied to examine the impact of FFS program on farm-level ecoefficiency. Findings The DEA results suggest that paddy farmers are highly eco-inefficient. The computed radial eco-efficiency score is 0.40 implying farmers could reduce around 60{\%} of environmental pressure equiproportionally even by maintaining the same level of value addition. In addition, the PSM results suggest farmers' participation in FFS program led to around 22.5{\%} higher radial ecoefficiency and 7–25{\%} higher environmental pressure-specific eco-efficiencies. Furthermore, simulation exercises reveal that FFS participation in interaction with farm size would lead to around 32–40{\%} reduction of all environmental pressures. Practical implications Promoting FFS programs among paddy farmers could be an effective policy option to improve eco-efficiency through environment-friendly farming paradigm. Originality/value This study is probably the maiden effort that has examined the impact of attending the FFS program on ecoefficiency improvement in Bangladesh. This study contributes to both the concern literature by adding useful information and the policymakers by providing new insights about the reduction of environmental resource usage with maintaining the same value addition from agrofarming.},

abstract = {Agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa faces a multitude of challenges arising from land degradation, climate change, and limited access to improved technology. In this context, technologies that raise farmers' crop productivity while mitigating risk exposure are particularly valuable. This study assesses the impacts of a modified, rainfed variant of the system of rice intensification (SRI) on expected yields, yield variance (variability) and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk) in Tanzania. The appeal of the technology lies in its yield-enhancing potential, its low demand for complementary external inputs as well as its drought resistance features. While the uptake of SRI has been considerable in Asia, the limited uptake in Africa is puzzling, particularly given its suitability for the African setting. Our empirical strategy relies on the estimation of marginal treatment effect (MTE) models. We find that, while the average effects on adopters suggest that SRI enhances yield and reduces the downside risk of crop failure, the marginal treatment effects indicate that only farmers with low resistance to adoption, benefit. Our analysis also highlights the importance of farmers' climate perception for the adoption of SRI and the need for policies that increase climate awareness to ensure food security. However, these results may well be specific to small scale, rainfed rice cultivation in Africa and therefore may not be generalizable to situations where SRI relies on irrigation.},

abstract = {Irrigation dams enable farmers to harness substantial water resources. However, their use consumes finite water supplies and recycles agricultural water pollutants back into river systems. This paper examines the net effect of irrigation dams on infant mortality in South Africa. It relies on both fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches to counteract potential bias associated with non-random dam placement, with the latter approach predicting dam placement based on geographic features and policy changes. The analysis reveals that additional irrigation dams within South Africa's former homeland districts after Apartheid increased infant mortality by 10-20 percent. I then discuss and evaluate possible channels. Dam-induced increases in agricultural activity could increase water pollution and reduce water availability, and I provide supporting evidence that both channels may contribute. These results suggest a potential trade-off between the health costs of agricultural water use and the economic benefits of increased agricultural production.},

The empirical analysis is guided and interpreted with the help of a theoretical model that considers the effects of an irrigation project on the distribution of production, employment and income for different types of landowners. The paper concludes that the irrigation projects implemented in Peru had a positive impact on intended beneficiary households, but not in the way it could have been simplistically expected.

abstract = {Improving water-saving irrigation technology and water use efficiency are often regarded as effective ways to control the amount of agricultural water consumption, but the rebound effect may offset this effort in practice. Based on the sample of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper applies the meta frontier data envelopment analysis method to measure agricultural water efficiency, and then estimates the rebound rate of agricultural water resource applying difference-generalized method of moments and elasticity analysis formula. Further, the difference-in-difference model is used to test the effectiveness of China's water rights reform on China's agricultural water rebound rate in recent years. The results show that: (1) Within the survey period, the average agricultural water rebound rate of China in short-term and long-term were 0.49 and 0.66 respectively, and the water rebound rate in all provinces were positive, indicating that water rebound effect was widespread in China's agricultural water market; (2) Agricultural water rebound rates were significantly different among regions, which was higher in western region while were comparatively smaller in the eastern and central regions; (3) The water rights pilot project failed to restrain the rebound of agricultural water use, but promoted it, which may be resulted from the market frictions of water trade. According to the results, recommendations are put forward for the governments to reinforce management of water, improve water rights system and reduce trade costs, in order to reduce the friction of agricultural water market and the effective use of water resource. • We used meta frontier DEA to measure agricultural water efficiency. • We estimated agricultural water rebound rates in the short and long run. • The effectiveness of China's water rights reform is tested.

abstract = {Climate change affects crop production through exposure to droughts, floods, pests, and pathogens. To mitigate climate-induced production losses, various stress-tolerant varieties have been developed and adopted in many countries around the globe. We assess the impacts of adopting submergence-tolerant (Sub1) rice varieties on productivity, profit, and rice consumption in northwest Bangladesh, using Endogenous Switching Regression and cross-sectional data in 2016. The findings reveal that the adoption of Sub1 rice had a significant positive impact on yield (6.0{\%} higher), profit (55.0{\%} higher), and rice consumption (15.0{\%} higher) vis-a-vis the impact on non-adopters. Importantly, non-adopters could benefit if they adopted Sub1 rice--with about 8{\%}, 48{\%}, and 15{\%} more rice yield, profit, and rice consumption, respectively. The findings further reveal that approximately 42{\%} of the sampled farmers adopted Sub1 rice in northwest Bangladesh. The main drivers of this adoption are access to information on Sub1 rice through neighbors, farmer organizations, and training. Also, the application of pesticides and irrigation negatively affected the adoption of Sub1 rice. Finally, we find that rice production, profit, and rice consumption are location dependent. Therefore, we suggest implementing location-specific policies and developing social and institutional capacity to build trust in the new technology, which will increase the dissemination of Sub1 seeds by transferring agricultural knowledge and incentivizing farmers to adopt Sub1 rice in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of irrigation on household food security and poverty using a case study of Bwanje Valley Irrigation Scheme in Malawi. Data used in the analysis were collected from 412 households – 169 participants in the irrigation scheme and 243 non-participants. Due to the non-random selection of participants into the irrigation scheme, the study used endogenous switching regression to correct for sample selection bias. Propensity score matching was then used to measure the impact of irrigation on food security and poverty. Daily per capita caloric intake and agricultural income were the proxy measures used to measure food security and poverty, respectively. Despite farmers selling paddy rice at the farm gate on an individual basis and operating in an environment with inadequate water supply, the findings revealed that irrigation had a positive impact on annual agricultural income and daily per capita caloric intake. The impact of irrigation on household annual agricultural income was different among the participants, with those cultivating both rice and maize under irrigation earning more agricultural income than their counterparts growing rice only. The results also showed a positive impact of irrigation on daily per capita caloric intake, with both groups of irrigating farmers realizing similar improved levels of caloric intake over farmers that did not participate in the irrigation scheme. In addition, traditionally marginalized groups – households headed by youth, female-headed households, and low-income households – earned more agricultural income than what they would have earned if they did not participate in the irrigation scheme. The recommendations from the study are that irrigation interventions should be up scaled to other areas with potential irrigable land and should promote the growing of more than one crop. In addition, irrigation schemes should promote bulk marketing of processed rice through contract relationships with institutions (i.e. schools, prisons, hospitals) and private traders. },

Therefore, it is very vital to adopt and expand Climate-Smart agricultural (CSA) practices. By the cross-sectional data of 350 cotton farmers from major cotton-growing districts of Punjab Pakistan, adoption of CSA practices such as irrigation and soil and crop management practices is evaluated, and factors which affect farmer adoption decision and its impact on poverty, income, and yield are estimated by using logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) respectively. The results found that education, access to credit, tubewell ownership, farming experience, and access to extension services positively influenced farmers' adoption behavior. Further, PSM results revealed that adoption of CSA practices is economical, financially, environmentally desirable, and pro-poor. According to these findings, ultimately adoption would help in reducing the negative impact of climate change on the cotton crop by ensuring profits, removing the barriers in the adoption, disseminating the information about CSA, and strictly enforcing the regulations for CSA.},

@article{Rauniyar2012,
abstract = {In mid 1990s, fluctuating weather patterns and a decline in the availability of water from rivers and streams, particularly during the dry seasons, led to greater emphasis by the government of Nepal on groundwater irrigation. The 20-year Agricultural Perspective Plan, approved in 1994 with the support of the ADB, recognized the expansion of groundwater-based irrigation as a priority input in agricultural development, along with such complementary improvements as construction of all-weather agricultural roads, electrification, greater use of fertilizers, and better marketing activities. Since then, the number of shallow tubewell irrigation has rapidly increased as an integral part of this plan. The expansion of the groundwater-irrigated areas in Nepal has been based on the use of shallow tubewells which are more appealing to small- and medium-scale farmers due to its low capital investment requirements and suitability for small-scale operations. For the Terai farmers in Nepal, shallow tubewells are an attractive option because of good aquifers in many locations and higher cost of deep tubewells. This impact evaluation study quantifies the economic and noneconomic impacts of shallow tubewell irrigation in Nepal. It reviews the environmental impacts on project's beneficiaries, analyzes effectiveness and sustainability of water user groups, and generates findings, lessons and recommendations. The evaluation drew on the experience of the ADB-supported Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector Project which aims to increase agricultural productivity on a sustainable basis and to raise the incomes of farmers with less than 1 hectare of land by developing group-based shallow tubewell irrigation, improving farm-to-market access roads, and providing agricultural extension services. The project covered 12 districts in the lowland Terai region of Nepal. It installed 10,870 shallow tubewells, constructed 300 kilometers of farm-to-market roads, and delivered extension services to farmers by engaging nongovernment organizations. One of the issues arising from this evaluation is the ineffective policy to support shallow tubewell development. In 2009, the government reversed a previous policy of not subsidizing shallow tubewell installation. This however did not result in expanded shallow tubewell irrigation because the government lacked the ability to adequately fund the subsidies. While this left small farmers unable to adopt groundwater irrigation, the announcement of the policy reversal hurt loan recovery, particularly by rural development banks in the eastern and central regions. Many farmers who had previously paid the full price for shallow tubewells now hope that their outstanding unsubsidized loans will be written off one day. Hence, eagerness to repay the loan may drop further. The evaluation recognizes the tremendous potential for shallow tubewell irrigation in Nepal and it recommends developing a unified groundwater irrigation policy that builds on the success of the project so that government subsidies for shallow tubewell provision are minimized. The evaluation also suggested for ADB to steer away from fragmented approach which only addresses one or two elements of the food-water-energy nexus. Links among and between food production, water and energy availability, marketing and agribusiness needs to be taken into account.},

Estimating panel fixed effects regressions, we find that exposure to JGY is associated with substitution away from diesel pumps, an increase in tubewell ownership, and greater likelihood of irrigating with tubewells. Further, there a positive and statistically significant correlation between JGY exposure and per acre cost of purchased water for irrigation. Consequently, we find a negative correlation between JGY exposure and net farm income per acre. We conclude that in the short-to-medium term concomitant increase in irrigation costs can negate the gains from more reliable but rationed farm electricity. Simultaneous policy measures alongside feeder segregation are thus needed to ensure affordable irrigation and subsequently farmers' welfare.},

abstract = {It is agreed that adopting irrigation technology improves production, productivity, income, and access to food for farm households. However, evidence on nutritional outcomes of small-scale irrigation technologies is quite scant. The existing studies focus on the productivity and poverty effect of irrigation. Thus, this study examines the impact of adoption of small-scale irrigation technologies on child nutritional wellbeing of farm households where nutritional wellbeing is measured through anthropometric indicators. Data were collected from 130 sample households drawn from Dangila and Bahir Dar Zuria wereda's 3 . The Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was employed to identify comparable technology adopting and non-adopting sample households. The study found malnutrition to be severe in the study area. Both chronic and acute Malnutrition problems were found to be wider for girls, for children aged below 2 years of age, and for non-adopters of the technology. Results of the average treatment effect on treated participants suggest that adoption of small-scale irrigation technologies has a positive impact on improving the adopters' short-term nutritional status but its impact on children being chronically malnourished and underweight is insignificant. This study concludes that children of small-scale irrigation technology adopting households have significantly lower acute malnutrition status than those of non-adopting households even after controlling for the potential heterogeneity. Targeting diffusion of small-scale irrigation technology with early nutrition-specific intervention for long-term nutritional improvement is vital to secure child nutritional wellbeing.},

This article aims to investigate the impact of small-scale irrigation on households' livelihood. To deal with the problems of purposive targeting and self-selection which are likely to occur for this type of intervention, we use a sophisticated econometric technique called ‘propensity score matching' to study this impact. Our findings confirm the presence of a statistically significant difference in income, overall expenditure, asset accumulation and expenditures on agricultural inputs between the treated and control households. In contrast, no statistically significant differences in livestock resources, food consumption, and expenditure on education and health were found. Furthermore, the proportion of poor is respectively 20 and 30{\%} for the treated and control households. So, overall it can be concluded that participation in the small-scale irrigation has robust and positive effect on most of the livelihood indices and that an expansion of irrigation schemes is a good strategy in the water-stressed and drought-prone areas of Ethiopia},

Access to irrigation increases household consumption by 27-30{\%} relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20{\%} more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household's savings behavior and informal insurance network.},

abstract = {This paper investigates differences in household production and consumption among small- and large- scale irrigators to assess whether the scale of an irrigation project increases household welfare in Mali. Much of the evidence of the impact of irrigation does not use counterfactual analysis to estimate such impact or distinguish between the scale of the irrigation projects to be evaluated. In the dataset collected by the author, both a large-scale irrigation project and small-scale projects are used to construct counterfactual groups. Propensity score matching is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for small and large irrigators relative to nonirrigators on agricultural production, agricultural income, and consumption per capita. Small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and agricultural income than large-scale irrigation, but large-scale irrigation has a larger effect on consumption per capita. This suggests that market integration and nonfarm externalities are important in realizing gains in agricultural surplus from irrigation.},

abstract = {Agriculture remains a major source of livelihood in Rwanda. However, the sector is faced by many covariate risks. A major component of covariate risk in Rwandan agriculture is weather-related production risk. Weather index-based crop insurance is one tool used to improve risk management practices in many drought-prone countries including Rwanda. Despite the existence of crop insurance as a mechanism to mitigate weather-related losses, its impact on household income in Rwanda remains unknown. This study assessed the impact of farmer participation in a crop insurance scheme on household income in Huye District. A multi-stage random sampling strategy was used to collect primary data using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to a sample of 246 households. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patterns of farmer participation and uptake of crop insurance in the study area. Propensity score matching (PSM) was then used to assess the impact of farmer participation in crop insurance on household income. This involved an analysis of factors influencing farmer participation in the insurance scheme using a logit model. The results of the logit model showed that cooperative membership (p=0.001), use of irrigation (p=0.060), crop diversification (p=0.001), years of experience with crop insurance (p=0.000), distance to a paved road (p=0.01), and wealthy category (p=0.004) significantly influenced farmer participation in the crop insurance in Huye District. The Nearest Neighbor Matching, Radius Matching and Kernel-Based Matching algorithms showed that the matching process was justified among participants and non-participants in the insurance scheme. An average treatment effect of US{\$}100 was found as the difference between participant and non-participant household income. This shows that the weather index-based insurance had a positive impact on participants' incomes in Huye District. Accordingly, the study recommends the promotion of the crop insurance among non-participants through educational and awareness campaigns by the v Ministry of Agriculture and insurance companies. The government of Rwanda in partnership with Rwanda Cooperative Agency should persuade more farmers to join cooperatives through regular and targeted campaigns. },

abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of land reforms on household agricultural investments, livelihood strategies, and income levels in Brazil. Given the persistence of rural poverty in Northeast Brazil and the existence of both land and credit market failures, land reforms remain important policy tools for alleviating poverty and increasing growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the recent National Program of Land Credit, a controversial market-assisted land reform program that provides access to land through private land markets. Household-level panel data covering similar beneficiary and control groups allows for identification using both propensity score weighting and difference-in-difference methodologies. The evidence indicates that the Land Credit successfully transitions households into agriculture, with land holdings and investments increasing as a result of the program. As with many earlier land reform programs in Latin America, the new wave of market-assisted land reforms does not increase access to private credit. While land reforms have the potential to drive redistribution, poverty reduction, and growth, these findings suggest that ensuring greater access to credit, irrigation, and higher return economic activities remains important.},

Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated andcompared.Findings – The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associatedwith increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates thatcooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantlyassociated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, totalfarmland, distance to market and geographic location).Practical implications – The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be animportant tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperativemodels together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefitsof collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition,governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity buildingprograms related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internalinstitutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that allmembers benefit from cooperatives.Originality/value – Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity andtechnical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. Itprovides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potatoproduction and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design.},

However, there is no study on profit efficiency of safe tea producers, which are therefore barriers for farmers and policymakers in terms of extending the safe tea production practice in Vietnam. Thus, this study investigated the profit efficiency of tea production practices using a stochastic profit frontier function. We applied propensity score matching to control for self-selection in assessing the profit efficiency of safe and conventional tea farming. Our results indicated that the average profit efficiency of tea farmers was around 74{\%}, suggesting 26{\%} of profit was lost due to inefficiency. Furthermore, significant different profit efficiency was observed between the two farmer groups. We further found that tea farmers with larger production scale, better irrigation system, accessing extension service are more likely to adopt safe tea practices than others are. Thus, public policies should focus on improving profit efficiency and facilitating adoption of eco-friendly production practice, and also supporting innovations to improve farmers' production conditions, including the access to extension service, irrigation system, enlarged farm size, and labor-saving machinery.},

This paper utilizes panel data from the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) from 2003 to 2013. The results show that the average sales value and total production of sticky rice for irrigated households is greater than those for non-irrigated households by around 36 to 38{\%} per season. Moreover, irrigated households experience improved sticky rice productivity of approximately 2.44 tons per hectare, per season, compared to non-irrigated households. In particular, compared to households with access to irrigation in one period of the surveys, households with access to irrigation in two periods of the surveys have nearly double the sticky rice productivity. Therefore, long-term access to irrigation is more effective for sticky rice productivity. However, we cannot find any evidence to support the impact of irrigation on household consumption. Some policy implications that can be derived from this research are that farmers should be intensively promoted to make the most use of irrigation, development of irrigation system is highly needed, and to ensure effectiveness of irrigation utilization local farmer involvement in monitoring procedure of irrigation is necessary.},

The study shows: First, water-saving irrigation area not only can save agricultural water use, but also has a significant positive effect on production of food crops; Second, water-saving irrigation area affects production of food crops through agricultural input factors, such as sown area, chemical fertilizer, and mechanized power; Third, there is heterogeneity in the effect of water-saving irrigation area on production of food crops, in which water-saving irrigation area has a greater impact on production of food crops in areas where there is less rainfall, or lower water-saving irrigation rate. Therefore, the water-saving irrigation promotion has a significant role in promoting China's production of food crops and has made a certain contribution to ensuring food security},

Second, CF adoption increases food security and varies with the revealed risk preference of smallholders, and risk-seeking smallholders tend to gain higher food security. Third, regardless of revealed risk preferences, smallholders who did not adopt CF beneﬁt from adoption by reducing their labor requirements, with no signiﬁcant losses in yield.},

abstract = {Irrigation remains a critical input into farming and, therefore, it remains a proxy for food security and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Despite their role in economic growth and the received investment, irrigation schemes are still underperforming. Among many irrigation schemes, transferring more management responsibilities to farmers proved to be a viable path toward improving performance. However, the large diversity of implementation strategies makes evaluation difficult, while its well-demonstrated benefits have paramount importance to convince reluctant smallholders to take additional roles. In order to address this gap, we analyze the effects of participation on farming outcomes (yield, revenue, net profit) by estimating the treatment effect. We present the case study of a Mubuku small-scale irrigation scheme, Uganda. We provide a framework to construct the Farmers Participation Index while distinguishing farmers into participating and not participating groups. The effects of participation are investigated through econometric methods including nonparametric and semiparametric estimation methods such as a difference in means, a regression adjustment, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. The analysis reveals a positive and significant treatment effect of participation on farming outcomes. The obtained results endorse the efforts of governmental programs to foster responsibility transfer and the farmers' role in irrigation management. A strong causal relationship between management and profitability provides incentives for farmers to engage in participation.},

Koga irrigation development project (KIDP) is one of such initiatives developed to reduce food insecurity. However, due to political unrest, poor watermanagement practice, limited market linkages and other institutional challenges, the project has not reached its desired goals. The purpose of this study is thus to evaluate the extent to which KIDP has impacted on household food security. Data were collected from 395 farm households and two FGDs drawn using random sampling technique. Multidimensional household food security index and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to measure food security and estimate the impact ofirrigation on food security, respectively. The descriptive analysis shows thatmajorities ofthe sample households were mildly food insecure in the study area. The PSM estimated that irrigation has positive and statistically significant impact on household annual income. However, the impact of irrigation on household food security found statistically insignificant. The FGD analysis confirmed that both groups of households had closely similar food security status. Accordingly, the study concluded that increasingly generated income in irrigation agriculture might not necessarily guarantee multidimensional household food security. Therefore, the growing interest of policymakers in promoting irrigation should integrally plan mechanisms of converting income into food security.},

To overcome the estimation bias existing in previous studies, we use the difference-in-differences method, which can separate time effects from policy treatment effects and is an effective tool to compare the effect before and after policy implementation. We, therefore, use this method to evaluate the net effect of the WRTPP on food security. It is found that the WRTPP can help ensure food security. This effect reaches its maximum in the fourth year after the policy's implementation. It is further found that the WRTPP can improve the adoption of agricultural water-saving irrigation technology to increase the grain yield. Our conclusions complement existing evidence on the factors influencing food security. From the perspective of improving farmers' water-saving irrigation technology, we confirm that the mechanism of the water rights trading pilot policy helps ensure food security.},

It identifies the treatment effect of irrigation access by exploiting a situation where the government used lotteries to distribute irrigated plots. Furthermore, in order to disentangle the channels through which the irrigation reduces poverty, we extend the seasonal consumption smoothing model of Paxson (1993; “Consumption and Income Seasonality in Thailand.” Journal of Political Economy 191(1):39-72) by introducing endogenous credit constraints. Using unique household level monthly panel data over a year, it is shown that with irrigation accessibility, not only the average income increases but also the patterns of income fluctuation changes and the probability of binding credit constraint declines through which transient poverty is mitigated. These empirical results suggest that irrigation infrastructure has a positive impact on reducing both chronic and transient poverty directly and indirectly by improving income and relaxing credit constraints.},

This study aim at shedding some light on an evaluation of climate mitigation agricultural adoption technologies, and its contribution to rural livelihood outcomes in Gurawa district using cross sectional data collected from randomly selected 180 sample households during the 2016 crop production season. Multivariate probit and Propensity score matching was used to identify impacts of adoption technologies, and to identify factors affecting smallholder farmers' multiple technology adoption decisions. The results showed that the probability of adoption of agricultural technologies are influenced by several factors: family size, economical active members, education level, age of the household head, social status, soil fertility status, distance from extension office, land holding, distance to markets and distance to weather road. The impact evaluation results indicated that on average, the participation household in soil conservation has increased food security status and asset accumulation nearly by 38{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively, however it decreases the rate of poverty nearly by 51 percent. Use of improved seeds increased food security status and decreased poverty rate nearly by 38{\%} and 44{\%}, respectively. On the other hand, use of irrigation technology increased food security status and asset accumulation nearly by 23{\%} and 31.8{\%}, respectively, whereas it decreases the rate of poverty nearly by 29 percent. Similarly, adoption of row planting methods increased food security status and asset accumulation nearly by 28.7{\%} and 15.5{\%}, respectively, whereas it decreases the rate of poverty nearly by 51.5 percent.

abstract = {Governments in developing counties often promote intercropping (crops intercropped with fruit trees on cultivated land) schemes in order to improve smallholders' income. However, the implementation of such schemes is often hindered by inappropriate institutional environments and inefficient project management. It is important to assess the impacts of such intercropping programs, especially since such a cultivation strategy can often align closely with smallholders' livelihood strategies, particularly in poor and remote rural regions. This paper attempts to assess the impact of an intercropping program on participants' incomes in rural Xinjiang (China), and to explore the possible shortcomings in the program's design and implementation. We apply a propensity score matching method, based on a survey dataset of 352 households, supplemented with descriptive analysis based on our anecdotal field observations. The findings demonstrate that the intercropping program had negative effects on the incomes that participants derived from farming, their off-farm income and their gross income. Overall, participants experienced significant losses of income. Anecdotal observations show that land tenure insecurity played a crucial role in negating the anticipated income improvement effect of this program. Farmer's perceptions that they have limited security of tenure made them reluctant to invest the necessary time and resources to make the new cropping systems a success, while the available subsidies only partially covered the costs involved. In addition, the program led to a significant drop in yields of field crops as the trees were competing for a limiting and fixed supply of irrigation water.},

abstract = {The Gujarat state government had banned further extraction of groundwater and new electricity connection for agricultural purposes in 57 sub-districts, where over-exploitation of groundwater was observed, in 2001, and these regions were demarcated as dark zone in 2003. The micro-irrigation adopted farmers in these regions are entitled to get additional 10 per cent subsidy since 2012, and concurrently, the ban on new electricity connection was also withdrawn. In particular, adoption of micro-irrigation is mandatory for availing new power connection. Both of them could lead to a large-scale diffusion, and as a result, reducing pressure on groundwater extraction. Although various agricultural interventions are being incentivized in India, there is limited studies with respect to assessing its' impact on farmers' adoption behaviour. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate effect of the above said incentives (subsidy and power connection) on diffusion of micro-irrigation in the dark zone regions. Information on the diffusion of micro-irrigation, i.e., drip and sprinkler irrigation, between 2006-07 and 2014 were collected for 8073 villages and towns, combining both dark zone (treated sample) and its adjacent non dark zone talukas (control group). The empirical analysis was performed for three different samples: (i) full sample, (ii) villages along the administrative boundary line drawn between the dark zone and adjacent talukas, i.e., border villages, and (iii) pair-wise border villages; expected to get robust estimation in the latter two cases as there could be no significant difference with respect to hydrological scenario and cropping patterns. Employing ordinary Least Square fixed effects model, results reveal that these policies are positively influencing diffusion of micro-irrigation. A pecuniary benefits and power connection together, for example, enhance the likelihood of incremental adoption rate by 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent and area installed with micro-irrigation technologies between 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent. This study, henceforth, supports the continuation of present incentive policies to further heightening diffusion of such technologies, and this approach could be replicated in the case other resource efficient technologies as minimizing water and energy footprints are always a policy priority.},

abstract = {Research facilitating farmer{\^{a}}€“researcher collaboration and experiential learning may provide the missing element to tailor crop management recommendations to meet farmers{\^{a}}€™ needs. We tested different crop management systems for irrigated rice in three seasons of adaptive research trials in three locations in the middle Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to assess the agronomic and socio-economic viability of Recommended Management Practices (RMPs) compared to the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Farmers{\^{a}}€™ Practices (FPs). During the 2008 dry season, RMP and SRI significantly increased yields over FP by 2.3 and 2.6 t ha{\^{o}}°€1 across sites. Farmers analyzed their experiences in post-experiment meetings. They appreciated SRI{\^{a}}€™s yield and water-saving potential, but found it labor demanding, especially for weed man- agement requirements that coincided with horticultural activities. Conversely, farmers described RMP{\^{a}}€™s elevated herbicide rate as costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agro-chemical markets, herbicide volumes larger than typically used in FP might be difficult to reliably source. To modify manage- ment systems to fit farmers{\^{a}}€™ needs and assets, we collaboratively developed a fourth, {\^{a}}€˜Farmer Adapted Practice{\^{a}}€™ (FAP) that blended RMP and SRI. FAP used intermittent irrigation during the late vegetative stage, recommended crop density, intermediate seedling age, and a single round of mechanical weeding followed by localized herbicide application. Farmers compared FAP against the initial management systems in the subsequent seasons. Though no yield differences were found between RMP, SRI and FAP, each yielded significantly more (+1.0, +1.1 and +1.5 t ha{\^{o}}°€1) than FP. FAP also reduced labor requirements without increasing weed biomass compared to RMP or SRI, and used 40{\%} and 10{\%} less herbicide than RMP and FP, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions showed that FAP increased net profit potential and decreased economic risk. Prior to the 2009 dry season trials, the Senegalese state eliminated herbicide sub- sidies, doubling their cost. RMP, SRI and FAP yielded 2.9, 3.0 and 3.1 t ha{\^{o}}°€1 more than FP. FAP again reduced weeding labor and herbicide requirements while lowering production risk across sites. This study demon- strates the value-added outcomes that result from research that facilitates farmer{\^{a}}€“researcher collabora- tion to learn from, innovate and tailor management systems to fit local circumstances.},

@techreport{Bhargava2014,
abstract = {This dissertation aims to contribute to the understanding of today's development challenges by shedding light on the constraints, linkages, and opportunities currently facing rural populations in the developing world. It examines two policies aimed at increasing incomes of India's rural poor and the many rural sector linkages at play in their unfolding. Although recent years have been marked by high growth, particularly in urban areas and the services sector, the country remains vastly rural and agricultural in its population and economic activity. As impacts of climate change become more apparent, questions on the state of agriculture today and in the future are of increasingly paramount importance. Consequently, a primary focus of economic development policy—and this dissertation—is on agricultural productivity and efficiency, unskilled rural labor, and the role of natural resources in agriculture. The first two parts of this work examine outcomes of India's Mahatma Gandhi NationalRural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) on agricultural technology adoption and output. Since 2006, NREGA has offered up to 100 days per year of guaranteed public works employment to tens of millions of rural Indian households. Using a regression discontinuity design and Indian agricultural census data, the first essay finds that NREGA's impact in rural labor markets causes a shift of roughly 20 percentage points away from labor-intensive agricultural technologies toward labor-saving ones, particularly for small farmers and low-powered technologies. Farmers also use less water-related technology, such as diesel pumps and alternative irrigation systems, because of NREGA's focus on water infrastructure. The second essay explores the potential long-run impact of the program on agricultural output by developing a household-farm model that includes as inputs short-run results of NREGA on agricultural wages, technology adoption, and infrastructure development. The model is intended to capture the highly-interdependent nature of India's rural sector and the many reverberations that take place over time. The model deviates from neoclassical economic assumptions in allowing households to be both producers and consumers of farm goods and have a full-income constraint incorporating household decisions in both capacities. A simple numerical exercise with recent Indian household-farm data shows that NREGA can lead to impacts of 6–12{\%} increases in agricultural output and hired labor demand in the long run. ivThe final essay focuses on eastern Uttar Pradesh and household-level adoption of waterconserving agricultural technology (WCT). WCTs can reduce the amount of irrigated water needed to grow the staple crops on which the poor depend, such as rice and wheat, while increasing yields. This study builds on previous analyses of private costs and returns to agricultural technology adoption by examining localized spatial externalities of Laser Land Leveling (LLL). It calibrates a hydro-economic model of groundwater supply using household-plot level data gathered in Maharajganj, Deoria, and Gorakhpur districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Results show that, with careful socio-economic and hydro-geological spatial distribution of WCTs such as LLL, policymakers may be able to achieve both decreases in poverty and increases in natural resource conservation with a single policy tool. These studies contribute to the current policy debates in India focused on balancing agricultural development, unskilled rural worker populations, poverty alleviation, and natural resource management. Moving forward, rural development strategies must consider the inter-linkages highlighted here in order to better predict impacts of development and natural resource programs. For example, NREGA may increase rural incomes, incentivize technology adoption, and develop public infrastructure in the short run, but depending on its impact on agricultural output, long-run employment and rural productivity outcomes may be uncertain. Meanwhile, direct intervention into select agricultural technology markets, such as those for WCTs, could lead to more nuanced policies that take advantage of the socio-economic and hydro-geological distribution of farmers in the country. There are many policies that can be introduced in a country as vast and complex as India. As Devesh Kapur wrote in 2005, “It has long been claimed that everything one can say about India is true—and so is the opposite.” This research hopes to shed light using rigorous empirical analysis on some of the key linkages that do exist in India's rural sector today.},

abstract = {Evidence on the potential for agricultural intensification to improve nutrition has grown considerably. While small-scale irrigation is a key factor driving agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan Africa, its impact on nutrition has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this study, we assess the impact of adoption of small-scale irrigation in Ethiopia and Tanzania on household and women's dietary diversity, as well as children's nutrition. We use two rounds of primary data collected from irrigators and nonirrigators in Ethiopia and Tanzania. We used a panel fixed effects econometric approach to control for observed household, women and children specific characteristics as well as observed and unobserved time-invariant confounding factors. The results show that among Ethiopian households who reported having faced drought, women in irrigating households have higher Women's Dietary Diversity Score (WDDS) compared to women in nonirrigating households. In Tanzania, women in irrigating households have higher WDDS compared to nonirrigators and the impact of irrigation on WDDS more than doubles among households facing drought. In addition, among Tanzanian households who reported having faced a drought shock, irrigating households have higher Household Dietary Diversity Score compared to nonirrigators. Children in irrigating households in Ethiopia have weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) that are 0.87 SDs higher, on average, than WHZ of children in nonirrigating households. In Tanzania, irrigation leads to higher WHZ-scores in children under-five among households who reported having experienced a drought in the 5 years preceding the survey. The study shows small-scale irrigation has a strong effect on households' economic access to food and on nutritional outcomes of women and children.},

abstract = {Investment in agricultural water management has been one key poverty reduction strategy in developing countries. In Ghana, irrigation development for livelihood support, which dates back to the 1960s manifested in the development of formal irrigation infrastructure, starting with the rural savannah and coastal regions. This study applied a propensity score matching (PSM) approach and regression analysis (ordinary least squares and switching regression) to ascertain that, pro-poor irrigation investment in the rural savannah region of Ghana is justified due to significant irrigation contribution to consumption expenditure per capita in farm households. The results also show differences in the impacts of irrigation access on household consumption expenditure per capita due to differences in the methodologies employed. The gain in household consumption expenditure per (GH¢) using the different methodologies are as follows: Propensity Score Matching approach (GH¢ 24.90, GH¢28.30), ordinary least squares regression (GH¢ 5.40), and switching regression (GH¢23.70). Thus, the range of estimates of irrigation's impact on household consumption expenditure is positive (GH¢ 5.4 to GH¢ 28.3). The differences in the magnitude of these estimates are ascribed to the underlying assumptions and robustness of each of these methodologies employed in the study.},

A total of 480 farmers (80 focal and 400 control) were selected as sample from Mymensingh, Comilla, Bogra and Gaibandha districts. Focal farmers were selected purposively and a limited amount of nancial support was provided to them to implement WST. On the other hand, control farmers were selected randomly. They did not receive any nancial support and continued practicing conventional irrigation methods. For analyzing the data, a combination of descriptive, mathematical and statistical techniques was used. The study revealed that 62.5 and 37.5{\%} of focal farmers adopted alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and system of rice intensi cation (SRI) methods, respectively, where the majority of them were within the late majority group in terms of adoption. The pro tability and productivity of Boro rice, as well as water productivity, were comparatively higher for focal farmers compared to control farmers. Furthermore, focal farmers{\^{a}}€™ irrigation amount for producing Boro rice was signi cantly lower than control farm- ers. The study also revealed that focal farmers{\^{a}}€™ income from rice production was 24.6{\%} higher than control farmers.

@techreport{Meenakshi2013,
abstract = {Executive summary: The purpose of this evaluation was to quantify the impact of the recent policy change in West Bengal relating to the pricing of electricity from a flat-rate tariff to a metered tariff. The study attempted to assess its impact on the total number of hours pumped, especially in the summer season, and its distribution across use on the pump owner's own farm and sales to other farmers. Program theory suggested that we should see a decline in pumping use overall, but the impact on water use on farms and on sales could be mitigated through various factors. We also examined the impact of this policy change on a set of secondary impact variables that included changes in cropping patterns and crop output. The quantification of impact was made feasible through surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 as part of other studies (Mukherji 2007b; Mukherji et al. 2009) which served as a baseline; the policy of metering tube wells had not yet been initiated then. A 3ie-funded follow-up survey was conducted in 2010, revisiting the same villages and households, to create a panel data set for analysis. Since in 2010, metering had not been implemented in full, some of the baseline villages and households did not have metered tube wells, and thus these served as controls. We also augmented the baseline sample by adding additional villages and households within a village, for a total sample size of over 850 households. Our major result is that the expected impact on reducing pumping hours was felt only in the boro season.1 There is also some evidence that this decrease was not confined to own-farm irrigation, but that water sales and purchases were also adversely affected as a consequence. Yet, metering did not influence either cropping patterns or the output of boro paddy.The latter could well be explained by the overuse of water among those who irrigate their own farms, so that reductions in water use do not translate into decreased output. The impact was insignificant for all indicators in the kharif2 and rabi3 seasons. The evidence of decreased sales and purchases may have implications for equity, especially if small farmers are being driven out of the market completely. Yet, their decreased access to water does not seem to have altered cropping patterns. These impacts have to be seen against the backdrop of an overall decline in pumping hours that was seen in both control and treatment groups, which may have served to swamp the impact of metering. The fact that many of the signs have the expected negative sign, but are insignificant, may mean that our sample was underpowered to detect impact. Drawing policy implications from these impact results requires further analysis. We are currently modelling production technology and the economics of water use to assess whether alternative options, such as a two-part tariff, may be an optimal policy to pursue.},

Over the subsequent planting season, the local irrigation association organized voluntary canal-cleaning days to manage the shared canal systems that irrigate farmers' fields. Treated farmers were 56{\%} more likely than those in the control group to volunteer. The mechanisms through which the treatment seemed to operate was by increasing social connections between plot neighbors and shifting participants' expectations of others' contributions to the public good, suggesting that public goods games provide a setting in which to connect with and learn about one's neighbors and to develop common norms of behavior.},

Results also show that Fadama users significantly had higher mean percentage increase in yield of about 21{\%} than non-Fadama users who recorded only a mean of about 15{\%} increase. The variables that significantly affected rate of adoption were, Farming experience, Farm size Non-farm incomes, access to advisory services and cost of technology adoption, all of which except the last positively influenced rate of adoption. Among the constraints to adoption of technologies, cost of adoption, lack of knowledge of improved technologies, complexity of available technologies and late delivery of required improved technologies were most serious. Among other recommendations it was suggested that governments should intensify efforts to the promotion of the more adoption of proven technologies through the provision of credits in order to increase productivity.},

In the study area also about 70 percent of the irrigation users are food secure while only 20 percent of the non-users are found to be food secure. Access to irrigation enabled the sample households to grow crops more than once a year; to insure increased and stable production, income and consumption; and improve their food security status.

abstract = {We investigated the impacts of piped water on water quality, sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes in marginalized rural households of north-western Bangladesh using a quasi-experimental analysis. A government organization – the Barindra Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) – established a piped water network to provide these rural households with improved water as they have poor access to potable water. Using propensity score matching, the study compares a treatment and a control group of households to identify gains in water-sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes. We found that the BMDA piped water infrastructure had a positive impact on access to improved water and significantly reduced the distance traveled for and time spent on collecting drinking water. However, we found no improvement in the drinking water quality, which was measured by the extent of fecal contamination (E. coli count per 100 ml of water) at the point of use. The hygiene status of food utensils also did not show any improvement; food utensils were tested positive for E. coli in both the control and treatment group. Although access to BMDA piped water in the premises involves cost, it didn't improve hygiene behavior: handwashing with soap after defecation and before feeding children. The treated households own larger water containers which implies that the intervention has had a clear impact on the quantity of water used for household purposes. However, we did not find evidence of health benefits, such as decreased diarrhea incidence of in under-five children, improved child anthropometrics stunting, underweight and wasting of children due to piped water use.},

abstract = { This paper attempts to address the impact of the MGNREGA on the rural agricultural sector, focusing on cropping patterns, irrigated area, crop yields, wages and rural employment. The analysis is based on two data sources: the first is a unique district-season level panel dataset that we construct using multiple sources, and the second is unit record data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Surveys. To identify causal effects, we employ a difference-in-difference matching procedure, where districts are matched based on propensity scores; the use of propensity scores represents a novel aspect of this paper. We also examine pre-programme trends for each outcome variable to provide a check on the validity of our estimates. Our results indicate modest changes in cropping patterns that are state and period specific; however, they do not indicate any improvements in crop yields that were expected given the MGNREGA's focus on investments in irrigation, although there is some evidence that irrigated area may have expanded after a lag. We also find that there is no systematic evidence of impact on wages and therefore no evidence that public works employment in MGNREGA crowded out casual labour in agriculture.},

abstract = {For many developing countries, the productivity of irrigation investments has been falling as a re- sult of poor operations and maintenance (O{\&}M). This problem has increasingly been addressed in development projects by putting users and com- munities in charge of O{\&}M, an approach known as participatory irrigation management (PIM). However, the effect of this approach on equity, and hence its implications for poverty reduction, have yet to be fully explored. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank has examined the paradoxical nature of irrigation projects by evaluating the impact of two such projects in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Irrigation Projects II and III (AP II and AP III) aimed to irrigate 393,000 hectares (ha) of land—65,000 ha served by the Srisailam Right Bank Canal (SRBC), 163,000 ha served by a re- habilitated canal, and 165,000 ha gained from ex- tending the system under the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP). Together these projects were expected to benefit more than 300,000 farm households},

abstract = {The current study is based on comprehensive cross sectional data set collected through field survey from all the four major provinces of Pakistan i.e. Punjab, Sindh, KPK and Balochitan. In total 950 farmers were interviewed. This paper attempts to examine the factors that influence farmers' choice of water pumps (e.g. electric, diesel, solar photovoltaic (PV) or biogas), and to assess the impact of these water pumps on crop productivity, household income, and poverty. The paper uses the multivariate probit model and propensity score matching approach in order to achieve these objectives. The empirical results indicate that educated, younger, and wealthier farmers are more likely to adopt alternate energy-based water pumps for irrigation. Access to credit facilities and frequent hours of load shedding are key factors influencing a farmer's decision to adopt alternative energy-based water pumps rather than relying on electricity. Alternative energy sources have positive and significant impacts on the productivity of wheat, rice and maize crops and on household income. The use of alternative energy sources for water pumping has resulted in the reduction of poverty in the range of 11-20{\%}. The study has important policy implications. The current energy crisis in Pakistan has adversely affected farming operations and in turn crop yield, and the use of water pumps for irrigation based on alternative energy sources has increased crop productivity. Access to these renewable energy technologies for water pumping should be encouraged through subsidies and easy availability of credit facilities, as the majority of farmers in Pakistan are resource-poor with small landholdings.},

abstract = {Despite the past investments and continued interests in public infrastructure like large irrigation dams, there has been limited evidence for their effects on household level consumptions and agricultural production, and how these effects are spatially distributed, depending on the locations of households in relations to the dams. Using a panel household survey, information of the locations of large irrigation dams, drainage basins, and drought index, we assess how large irrigation dams benefit households' consumptions and agricultural production, mitigate the effects of drought, and how these effects are distributed across drainage basins in Nigeria. We classify households into dam-basins (basins that contain large irrigation dams), downstream basins (those located downstream of dams), and other non-dam basins. Multinomial inverse-probability weighting method, combined with difference-in-difference methods, construct appropriate counterfactual samples, through which the effects of large irrigation dams and their variations across drainage basins are identified. We find that large irrigation dams largely benefit the downstream basins, rather than dam-basins or other basins. Households in downstream basins, for whom suitable matches can be found in other types of basins, are less affected by the drought and enjoy relatively stable growth rates of real per capita income and food consumption, compared to what they would experience if they were in other types of basins. Such relative stability in incomes and food consumption in downstream basins, despite the droughts, are partly due to the stable food production that is enabled by the supply of irrigation waters from the dams in the event of drought. These findings are robust against the effects of drought on water supply to the dams, proxy of state level political factors, and drought timing. The findings have important policy implications. Drainage basins have only been recently estimated relatively accurately in countries like Nigeria, while most irrigation dams in Nigeria had already been built by the 1990s. Locations of the new construction or rehabilitation of irrigation dams in Nigeria should carefully consider not only the agroecological and socioeconomic conditions, and weather-risks like droughts in the drainage basins where dams are located, but also these conditions of downstream drainage basins.},

abstract = {Agricultural training is a potentially effective method to diffuse relevant new technologies to increase productivity and alleviate rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers' technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the conventional farmer training approach.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the impact of an agricultural technology adoption program on agricultural production and income using an experimental approach. The context of analysis is the Program for the Support of Innovation in Agricultural Technology (PATCA II) implemented in the Dominican Republic. The program aimed to increase the agricultural productivity and income of smallholder farmers by encouraging the adoption of a technology. We exploit a two-stage randomized experiment conducted at the geographic and farmer levels to estimate the effects of adopting improved pasture and irrigation technologies. To measure the effectiveness of the program, we combined rich microeconomic data obtained from a comprehensive household survey with administrative data to measure both direct and spillover effects. The sample includes 2,499 farmers, including direct beneficiaries, indirect beneficiaries, controls, and farmers within the social network of direct beneficiaries. We find different patterns of adoption and significant impacts on production-related outcomes for both of the technologies analyzed. The results show adoption of improved pastures increased agricultural income and that the effects intensify over time. In the case of irrigation, treatment had adverse effects on total household income and agricultural production; however, there is evidence of a change in the production portfolio of program beneficiaries from temporary to permanent crops as a function of time of exposure to the technology. Whereas irrigation can be implemented immediately after treatment, income benefits take time to materialize, for instance, as permanent crops reach the initial point of harvest or maturity. These results imply the existence of a dynamic learning-by-doing process. Also, the assessment of indirect or spillover effects did not validate the hypotheses that knowledge spillovers might take place among farmers in close geographical and social proximity to program beneficiaries. The results present evidence that liquidity constraints are critical determinants of technology adoption for smallholder farmers in the Dominican Republic.},

abstract = {Irrigation is a lynchpin of rural development strategies and a key input to improving productivity and farm incomes, the key source of livelihood for the majority of the world's poor. Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions.},

abstract = {Managing scarce irrigation water poses a major challenge globally because of changing climate and a rising population. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is widely regarded as a water-saving irrigation technology capable of contributing to sustainable water-use. Existing literature lacks rigorous quantitative analysis of the determinants and effects of AWD adoption. In contrast, applying logit, propensity score matching and multiple regression models to survey data from two drought-prone and groundwater-depleted areas in Bangladesh, this study identifies determinants and effects of AWD adoption and explores policy implications. Age and education-level of household head, access to prior weather information, landownership, topography, and soil-type are found to be significant determinants of AWD adoption. AWD is found to be water-saving, irrigation cost-decreasing and crop yield-increasing. However, AWD adoption in Bangladesh is not widespread. Major policy implications include information dissemination about the use and benefit of AWD through farmers' education and training for widespread adoption and diffusion of water-saving technologies. A rationally coordinated system of policy measures including significant strengthening of institutional support services, scientific research, rethinking of the cropping-mix and greater use of information technology constitute a sine qua non for achieving sustainable water management.},

Using the case of smallholder producers of African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) in peri-urban Kenya, we study whether irrigation-driven productivity growth translates into improved market participation by smallholders. We therefore a) identify factors that drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in Kiambu and b) study how irrigation affects vegetable marketing. We combine a regression analysis and propensity score matching in order to advance existing knowledge on the linkages of irrigation and marketing. We use a 2014 survey of 176 AIV producers in Kiambu County and 156 AIV traders in Nairobi County. We find that irrigation corresponds with up to 99{\%} market participation rate and 86{\%} of output sales. We find that irrigators participate more in urban markets, compete effectively with market intermediaries, have more price bargaining power, sell less at farm gate and face shorter value chains. Surprisingly supermarket outlets were associated with non-irrigators, while irrigators opt for wet markets. Although irrigators have larger commercialization indices, the effect of irrigation depends on the type of technology used. We find that irrigation and the associated access to better marketing arrangements is skewed towards farmers with off-farm income and male headed households. Targeted support for female-headed agricultural households to access modern irrigation technology is therefore an important policy measure we propose.},
