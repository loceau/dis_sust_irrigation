N2  - Steroid estrogens contamination has been linked to adverse effects on exposed aquatic biota. Steroid estrogens are excreted by all mammals and are found in most agricultural wastes including dairy manure and dairy shed effluent (DSE). Some previous studies have demonstrated elevated levels of free and conjugated estrogenic steroids in DSE and this source has increased as New Zealand has experienced rapid expansion and intensification of dairy farming. This research used an approach incorporating analytical chemistry and bioassays to evaluate the levels of estrogenic activity in environmental samples from representative dairy watersheds with differing DSE management practices: either land-applied or discharged to water. The results demonstrated that estrogenic activity and steroid estrogens were prevalent in the waterways within all the studied dairy watersheds. Estrone was the predominant steroid measured in watershed waters because of its presence in dairy cow wastes and as a degradate of the main dairy cow estrogen, 17α-estradiol. Measurable estrogenic activity (17β-estradiol equivalents, EEq) was found at low levels in 83% of the stream samples (highest 1.44ngL−1 EEq) and 75% of the groundwater samples (≤0.15ngL−1 EEq). While estrogenic activity was generally <1ngL−1, one (of 10) stream with measurable estrone, 17α- and 17ß-estradiol had activity of 1.4ngL−1, a level potentially harmful to aquatic biota. Comparable steroid estrogen concentrations and estrogenic activity were found whether DSE was spray irrigated on farm paddocks or directly discharged into waterways. This suggests that direct access of cattle to streams, the direct input of DSE into waterways and runoff from land application all require more intervention and effective management.

N2  - Many empirical equations have been developed to predict the properties of saturation extracts, primarily electrical conductivity, from the properties of soil water extracts of 1 to 5 ratio. Soil water 1:5 extracts are more rapidly and reproducibly prepared than saturation extracts. However, the electrical conductivity of saturation extracts (ECse) is the benchmark to assess soil salinity. Analysis of the information provided by the electrical conductivity of soil 1:5 extracts (EC1:5) is a prerequisite to guide equation development and to use EC1:5 for soil salinity assessment. A total of 135 soil samples were taken from 39 sites at up to four different depths per site, down to a maximum depth of 95cm in an irrigated agricultural area in SE Spain. Soil 1:5 extracts obtained from each sample were analysed for twelve chemical properties: concentration of sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, sulphate, alkalinity and electrical conductivity. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the correlation matrix of the log-transformed data set. The equilibrium status of 1:5 extracts with regard to gypsum was assessed with the chemical speciation programme SALSOLCHEMIS. The soil gypsum content was determined by using an adaptation of the classical method of total dissolution of soil gypsum, adequate to determine low gypsum contents, i.e. lower than 2%. Three principal components, accounting for 82% of the variance in the correlation matrix, were retained after eigenvector extraction. The first component accounted for 53% of the variance and was interpreted as representing the extract salinity due to gypsum dissolution. The second component accounted for 16% of the variance and was interpreted as representing the component of the extract salinity due to salts more soluble than gypsum, such as sodium and chloride salts. The information about soil salinity is split in two components in the 1:5 extracts, which are not easily resolved, whereas only one salinity component was obtained in the saturation extracts. The EC1:5 is a reliable property to estimate ECse, with a 95% confidence interval of ±1.2dSm−1, only when it is lower than 1dSm−1. When EC1:5 is higher than 2.4dSm−1 it could also be reliably used to estimate soil salinity only if the 1:5 extract is gypsum-saturated, which is highly probable when the soil gypsum content is higher than 1.5%, or when the saturation extract is not gypsum-saturated, situation which happens when soil gypsum content is lower than 0.2%. When the EC1:5 is between 1 and 2.4dSm−1, it provides poor information about the ECse, which could be between 4 and 14dSm−1 unless the soil gypsum content is negligible, i.e. lower than 0.2%. The usefulness of the EC1:5 to estimate soil salinity can be extended when it is used in conjunction with an estimate of soil gypsum content. The development of more than one equation to estimate ECse from EC1:5 depending on soil gypsum content is recommended.

N2  - Soil moisture deficit at early season is detrimental for sweetpotato growth and development affecting final yield. This study investigated the effects of different soil moisture regimes on early season growth, developmental, and physiological responses of two sweetpotato cultivars, ‘Beauregard’ and ‘Evangeline’, grown in a greenhouse environment. Five levels of soil moisture treatments, 0.256, 0.216, 0.164, 0.107, and 0.058m3m−3 of VWC, were maintained through sensor-based soil moisture monitoring, and semi-automated programmed irrigation. Midday leaf water potential (LWP), gas exchange, and fluorescence were measured weekly from 30 to 50 days after transplanting (DAT). Growth and development of plants were evaluated through harvesting four plants at 5-day intervals from 14 to 50 DAT. Leaf pigments and cell and chlorophyll stability indices were also determined. Midday LWP of sweetpotato declined linearly with decreasing soil moisture levels. The photosynthetic rate also declined linearly in Beauregard and quadratically in Evangeline with decreasing soil moisture. Both cultivars had a close association between photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance over the soil moisture treatments, suggesting that stomatal closure is a key limitation for the drop in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll concentration was significantly lower at extreme soil moisture deficit conditions. Significant difference was found in water use efficiency between cultivars and among soil moisture treatments. Rates of vine elongation and leaf formation of Evangeline decreased more rapidly than Beauregard with declining soil moisture levels. Also with decreasing soil moisture, the shoot biomass declined more rapidly than root biomass. The results showed that maintaining soil moisture closer to field capacity (0.256m3m−3 of VWC) during early season is beneficial for early development of both root and shoot system and thus better crop performance. The data and the inferences derived from the functional algorithms developed in this study will be useful for crop modelling, field-level irrigation scheduling, and planting decisions.

N2  - The spatio-temporal characteristics of remote sensing are considered to be the primary advantage in environmental studies. With long-term and frequent satellite observations, it is possible to monitor changes in key biophysical attributes such as phenological characteristics, and relate them to climate change by examining their correlations. Although a number of remote sensing methods have been developed to quantify vegetation seasonal cycles using time-series of vegetation indices, there is limited effort to explore and monitor changes and trends of vegetation phenology in the Monsoon Southeast Asia, which is adversely affected by changes in the Asian monsoon climate. In this study, MODIS EVI and TRMM time series data, along with field survey data, were analyzed to quantify phenological patterns and trends in the Monsoon Southeast Asia during 2001–2010 period and assess their relationship with climate change in the region. The results revealed a great regional variability and inter-annual fluctuation in vegetation phenology. The phenological patterns varied spatially across the region and they were strongly correlated with climate variations and land use patterns. The overall phenological trends appeared to shift towards a later and slightly longer growing season up to 14 days from 2001 to 2010. Interestingly, the corresponding rainy season seemed to have started earlier and ended later, resulting in a slightly longer wet season extending up to 7 days, while the total amount of rainfall in the region decreased during the same time period. The phenological shifts and changes in vegetation growth appeared to be associated with climate events such as EL Niño in 2005. Furthermore, rainfall seemed to be the dominant force driving the phenological changes in naturally vegetated areas and rainfed croplands, whereas land use management was the key factor in irrigated agricultural areas.

N2  - New cultivars, improved management and their interactions are key drivers of yield progress in field crops. This study examined the contribution of these factors to cotton yield increase in Australia with the adoption of 23 key locally bred cultivars developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) cotton breeding programme up to 2006. A lint yield dataset of advanced line trials from 1980 to 2009 (325 experiments) was analysed by a linear mixed model when split into two 15-year periods. These trials were conducted at up to 15 irrigated sites each year, and best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of cultivar yield and two long-term controls (Deltapine 16 and Namcala) were used to assess yield trend. Lint yield increased progressively as new cultivars were released and yield gain was almost three times as high in the recent 15-year period as the early one (18.3 versus 7.0kgha−1year−1). This gain tended to be greater in cooler than warmer regions, despite lower yield in the cool. The most recent cultivars also showed improved stability. When pairs of cultivars derived from intra-cultivar selection were compared, reselected ones outyielded their parents and with higher stability. The increased cultivar yield and the reduction of genotype×region and genotype×year interaction were the main reasons behind the ongoing improved yield and stability of these released cultivars. Using yield estimates of 10 cultivars tested in both time periods, yield gain was found to be attributed by cultivar, i.e. genetics (48%), management (28%) and cultivar×management (24%). There was evidence for cultivar resistance to Verticillium wilt being a strong component of the cultivar×management interaction. It was concluded that cotton yield progress in Australia was achieved mostly through exploiting genetic variation and genotypic response to modern management.

N2  - Application of different multivariate statistical approaches for the interpretation of data obtained during a monitoring programme of surface and groundwater in Patancheru industrial town near Hyderabad (India) is presented in this study. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. Thirteen parameters including trace elements (B, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Sr, Ba and Pb) have been monitored on 53 sampling points from a hydrogeochemical survey conducted in surface and groundwater. Data set thus obtained was treated using R-mode factor analysis (FA) and principal component analysis (PCA). FA identified four factors responsible for data structure explaining 75% of total variance in surface water and two factors in groundwater explaining 85%, and allowed to group selected parameters according to common features. Sr, Ba, Co, Ni and Cr were associated and controlled by mixed origin with similar contribution from anthropogenic and geogenic sources whereas Fe, Mn, As, Pb, Zn, B and Co were derived from anthropogenic activities. This study indicates the necessity and usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluation and interpretation of the data with a view to get better information about the water quality and design some remedial techniques to prevent the pollution caused by hazardous toxic elements in future.

N2  - Human pathogens can contaminate leafy produce in the field by various routes. We hypothesized that interactions between Escherichia coli O157:H7 and spinach are influenced by the route of introduction and the leaf microenvironment. E. coli O157:H7 labeled with green fluorescent protein was dropped onto spinach leaf surfaces, simulating bacteria-laden raindrops or sprinkler irrigation, and survived on the phylloplane for at least 14 days, with increasing titers and areas of colonization over time. The same strains placed into the rhizosphere by soil infiltration remained detectable on very few plants and in low numbers (102 to 106 CFU/g fresh tissue) that decreased over time. Stem puncture inoculations, simulating natural wounding, rarely resulted in colonization or multiplication. Bacteria forced into the leaf interior survived for at least 14 days in intercellular spaces but did not translocate or multiply. Three spinach cultivars with different leaf surface morphologies were compared for colonization by E. coli O157:H7 introduced by leaf drop or soil drench. After 2 weeks, cv. Bordeaux hosted very few bacteria. More bacteria were seen on cv. Space and were dispersed over an area of up to 0.3 mm2. The highest bacterial numbers were observed on cv. Tyee but were dispersed only up to 0.15 mm2, suggesting that cv. Tyee may provide protected niches or more nutrients or may promote stronger bacterial adherence. These findings suggest that the spinach phylloplane is a supportive niche for E. coli O157:H7, but no conclusive evidence was found for natural entry into the plant interior. The results are relevant for interventions aimed at minimizing produce contamination by human pathogens.

N2  - The Loess Plateau of China is a major apple-cultivating region, but much of the Plateau is water-limited, and the expansion of apple-growing is putting pressure on soil water resources. Plants’ water consumption patterns have been intensively studied to facilitate formulation of robust agricultural strategies, but previous studies have generally applied indirect methods to characterize their water use. Moreover, the few studies that have applied direct (isotopic) methods have mostly focused on shallow (0–200 cm) soil layers, usually in stands of a single age or single climatic region. To avoid these limitations, we have investigated the primary water sources of apple trees of three ages (10, 15 and 22 years) in semiarid and semihumid climatic regions of the Plateau using both natural stable isotopic signatures (δ2H values) and injections of 2H2O into deep soil layers. We found that water content in apple orchards’ soil decreased with increases in depth and stand age, and was higher in the semihumid area than in the semiarid area. Nevertheless, patterns of apple trees’ water uptake from shallow (0–300 cm) soil layers were similar in the two climatic regions and the main water sources became shallower with increases in stand age. However, water uptake from deep (400–500 cm) soil layers was also detected, particularly in the blossom and young fruit stage in apple orchards of the semiarid area. Moreover, older trees absorbed more water from these layers than younger trees in the semiarid area (but not in the semihumid area) throughout the growing season. Excessive consumption of deep soil water inevitably results in deep soil drying and severely threatens the sustainability of apple cultivation. Our work suggests that it is necessary to take actions (e.g. supplementary irrigation, landscaping and mulching combinations) to reduce the proportion of deep soil water used by apple trees to prevent the development of dried soil layers. It also highlights the need to assess uptake patterns of plants at multiple developmental stages and ages to identify times when and places where interventions may be required or most effective.

N2  - In South Asia, wheat is typically grown in favorable environments,
although policies promoting intensification in Bangladesh's stress-prone
coastal zone have resulted in expanded cultivation in this
non-traditional area. Relatively little is known about how to best
manage wheat in these unique environments. Research is thus needed to
identify `best-bet' entry points to optimize productivity, but classical
parametric analyses offer limited applicability to elucidate the
relative importance of the multiple factors and interactions that
influence yield under such conditions. This problem is most evident in
datasets derived from farmer-participatory research, where missing
values and skewed data are common. This paper examines the predictive
power of three non-parametric approaches, including linear mixed effects
models (LMMs), and two binary recursive partitioning methods:
classification and regression trees (CARTs) and Random Forests. We
collected yield, crop management, and environmental observations from
422 wheat fields in the 2012-13 season, across six production
environments spanning southern Bangladesh, where nutrient rates and
genotypes were imposed, but management of other production factors
varied from farmer to farmer. Fields were grouped into categories
including early- and late-sowing, depending on crop establishment before
or after December 15, respectively, and in combination, across both
early- and late-sowing groups. For each of these groups, we investigated
how each non-parametric analysis predicted the factors influencing
yield. All three approaches identified nitrogen rate and environment as
the most important factors, regardless of sowing category. CART also
identified assemblages of high- and low-yielding environments, although
those located in saline and warmer thermal zones were not necessarily
the lowest yielding, indicating that farmers can optimize crop
management to overcome these constraints. The number of days farmers
sowed wheat before or after December 15, days to maturity, and the
number of irrigations and weedings also influenced yield, though each
method weighted these factors differently. LMMs also indicated a slight
yield advantage when farmers used stress-tolerant genotypes, though CART
and Random Forests did not. One-to-one plots for observed vs. predicted
yields from LMMs and Random Forests showed better performance by the
former than the latter, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute
error for the combined, early- and late-sowing groups, respectively.
While the LMMs were superior in this case, Random Forests may still
prove useful in the classification and interpretation of farm survey
data in which no treatment interventions have been administered. (C)

N2  - Increasing scarcity of resources (labour, water, and energy) and cost of
production, along with climate variability, are major challenges for the
sustainability of rice-wheat system in the northwesten Indo-Gangetic
Plains (IGP). We hypothesized that adopting the principles of
conservation agriculture together with best crop management practices
would improve system productivity and overall efficiency, resulting in a
higher profitability. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the
performance of four cropping system scenarios (treatments), which were
designed to be adapted to current and future drivers of agricultural
changes. The treatments including farmers practices varied in tillage
and crop establishment methods, residue management, crop sequence, and
crop management. Zero-tillage direct-seeded rice (ZT-DSR) with residue
retention and best management practices provided equivalent or higher
yield and 30-50% lower irrigation water use than those of
farmer-managed puddled transplanted rice (CT-TPR). Overall, net economic
returns increased up to 79% with a net reduction in production cost of
up to US$ 55 ha(-1) in ZT-DSR than CT-TPR. Substituting rice with ZT
maize was equally profitable but with 88-95% less irrigation water use.
Avoiding puddling in rice and dry tillage in maize with residue
retention increased yield (by 0.5-1.2 t ha(-1)) and net economic returns
of the succeeding wheat crop. Inclusion of mungbean in the rotation
further increased system productivity and economic returns. In summary,
our initial results of 2-year field study showed positive effects of
CA-based improved management practices on yield and system efficiencies
with greater benefits in the second year. There is a need of longer term
monitoring to quantify cumulative effects of various interventions and
to eventually make recommendations for wider dissemination. (c) 2013

N2  - The National development plans mainly aim to conserve the arable lands in the Nile Valley and Delta, in addition to the Oases and desert fringes. Moreover, increasing land productivity is an important National goal for controlling the gap between food production and consumption. Therefore, providing accurate and integrated information about land resources is a must, especially with the accelerated progress of information technology. Such information would be the base for planning, decision making and research needs. Various available information and database systems were employed (e.g. ArcGIS, ERDAS IMAGINE and ENVI). Data of previous soil survey activities were the bases for the created GIS digital database. Soils survey maps (SCALE 1: 100,000), were prepared as GIS ready maps. Other thematic information layers were imported to the GIS model representing the networks of irrigation and drainage, roads, railways and utilities, each layer includes different categories. Urban settlements were updated using recent ETM+and SPOT satellite images. An intensive field investigation was performed in the study region, with the purpose of representing the soil units and collecting ground control points and soil samples for laboratory analyses. The created digital land resources database was used to figure the distribution of soil units and to evaluate and map land capabilities on the bases of FAO, 1985 [1]. It was found that the Entisols soil order characterize most of the alluvial soils of Nile Delta, while Aridisols cover a limited area. The soil orders Entisols and Aridisols were found dominating the western desert fringes of the Delta. The results showed that 41.16% of the Delta soils are classified as highly capable, corresponding with Vertic Torrifluvents soil sub-great group. The moderately capable soils, which correspond to Typic Torrifluvents sub-great groups, exhibit 8.00% of the Delta. The low capable soils, corresponding to sub-great groups Aquic Torrifluvents, Typic Haplocalcids and Typic Quartizipsamments represent 17.59% of the Delta located mainly around its northern lakes. The very low capable soils dominate the soils of lacustrine and desert deposits, representing 35.25% of the Delta. It could be pointed out that achieving such detailed digital land resources database for local administrations is a great step towards the implementation of sustainable development and management programs. It is characterized by its comprehensiveness, geographical accuracy and updatability. In the current Era of distinctive progress in information technology, such data can be handled, enhanced and exchanged by different users and authorities. The most striking findings noticed was the urban encroachment on the account of most fertile soils; hence shrinkage in areas of high agricultural capabilities. On the other hand, urbanization doesn’t extend largely to low capable land. It was also noticed that a common unbalance between irrigation and drainage system networks is often and may lead to progress of salinization and land degradation.

N2  - An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the enhanced yield possible with grafted tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) under field conditions will also increase the nitrogen (N) crop nutritional requirement (CNR). Determinate ‘Florida 47’ tomatoes were grafted onto interspecific hybrid rootstocks (‘Multifort’ or ‘Beaufort’) and grown in a sandy soil with six N rates (56, 112, 168, 224, 280, and 336kgha−1) under plastic mulched bed and drip-irrigation systems during the spring seasons of 2010 (March–June) and 2011 (April–July). The N-CNR for grafted and non-grafted tomatoes was assessed using five yield response functions: exponential, linear-plateau, quadratic-plateau, quadratic, and square root. Over the two seasons, the estimated N-CNR ranged from 165kgha−1 with the quadratic-plateau model to 324kgha−1 with the square root model. Confidence intervals (CI) around these N-CNR ranged from 125 to 585kgha−1 using the bootstrap method and from 98 to 440kgha−1 using the delta method. Analysis of these CIs gave N-CNR rates of 239–246kgNha−1 for grafted plants, and 196–197kgNha−1 for non-grafted plants. Predicted maximum marketable yields were similar between the models, ranging from 56 -71Mgha−1 for grafted plants, and 43–53Mgha−1 for non-grafted plants, over the two seasons. Overall, while the actual N-CNR is likely to vary with season, soil types, and management practices, the results indicated that grafted tomato plants had a greater N-CNR than non-grafted plants together with an increase in predicted marketable yield. The yield response curves also showed that at a fixed marketable yield goal within the estimated range, the N fertilization rate required was lower for the grafted tomato plants as compared with the non-grafted plants. This study demonstrated that N fertilization program for optimizing tomato production may be modified when grafted plants are used.

N2  - Land cover dynamics in the tropical dry environments of sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood compared to humid environments, especially on a national scale. Previous studies describing land cover in the dry tropics are spatially or temporally constrained. This study presents the first long-term (1972–2016) nationwide land cover dynamics and forest connectivity analyses for Zambia. We employed 300 Landsat images and an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach with the Random Forests (RF) classifier to map nine land covers at six time steps (1972, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2008 and 2016). Post-classification change detection was used to understand the dynamics, while landscape metrics were derived to assess the forest structural connectivity. Overall accuracies ranging from 79 to 86% were achieved. In 1972, 48% of Zambia was covered by primary forest and 16% was covered by secondary forest. By 2016, 62.74% of Zambia had undergone changes, with primary forest decreasing by 32% and secondary forest increasing by 23%. Our results showed that forests have been recovering by 0.03 to 1.3% yr−1 (53, 000–242, 000 ha yr-1); however, these rates are markedly lower than deforestation rates (- 0.54 to - 3.05% yr-1: 83, 000–453, 000 ha yr-1). Annual rates of change varied by land cover, with irrigated crops having the largest increase (+ 3.19 yr-1) and primary forest having the greatest decrease (-2.48% yr-1). Forest connectivity declined by 22%, with primary forest having the greatest decline, while the connectivity for secondary and plantation forest increased. We showed here that land cover in Zambia is highly dynamic with high rates of change, low forest recovery and decline in forest connectivity. These findings will aid in land use planning, reporting for the forthcoming 2020 Global Forest Resources Assessment, and carbon accounting, especially under the reduction in carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation programme (REDD+).

N2  - The aims of this study are: (1) producing a geometrically corrected physiographic-soil map scale 1:50,000 reduced to the attached map; (2) detecting some soil characteristics as (effective soil depth, salinity and alkalinity) of the investigated area during the last 28years to produce the soil resilience maps. To fulfill the first aim, eight soil profiles were selected from 30 profiles to represent the different mapping units. Morphological description was carried out and soil samples were collected for physical and chemical analyses. Based on ETM+ images and the geographic information system, coupled with the field work and laboratory analysis data, the physiographic-soil map was produced. The following main landscape units can be identified: (1) coastal plain (the fluvio-marine deposits) and (2) young sub-deltaic deposits. With respect to the second aim except some environmental processes which occur without human interference, the soil resilience resulted when soils are used and managed in the right way. Land use and management have a direct effect on soil resilience. It can decrease soil degradation and increase soil restoration and accordingly increase soil resilience. The main types of human activities included soil resilience in the investigated area are soil resilience against salinization, soil resilience against alkalinization and soil resilience against water logging. The human action on soil resilience could be recognized through the man-action as good and proper land management, introducing proper land modern irrigation and drainage styles, in addition to adequate fertilizing programs.

N2  - The California Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied Water
(Cal-SIMETAW) model is a new tool developed by the California Department
of Water Resources and the University of California, Davis to perform
daily soil water balance and determine crop evapotranspiration (ETc),
evapotranspiration of applied water (ETaw), and applied water (AW) for
use in California water resources planning. ETaw is a seasonal estimate
of the water needed to irrigate a crop assuming 100% irrigation
efficiency. The model accounts for soils, crop coefficients, rooting
depths, seepage, etc. that influence crop water balance. It provides
spatial soil and climate information and it uses historical crop and
land-use category information to provide seasonal water balance
estimates by combinations of detailed analysis unit and county
(DAU/County) over California. The result is a large data base of ETc and
ETaw that will be used to update information in the new California Water
Plan (CWP). The application uses the daily climate data, i.e., maximum
(T-x) and minimum (T-n) temperature and precipitation (P-cp), which were
derived from monthly USDA-NRCS PRISM data (PRISM Group 2011) and daily
US National Climate Data Center (NCDC) climate station data to cover
California on a 4 km x 4 km change grid spacing. The application uses
daily weather data to determine reference evapotranspiration (ETo),
using the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) equation (Hargreaves and Samani 1982,
1985). Because the ITS equation is based on temperature only, ETo from
the HS equation were compared with CIMIS ETo at the same locations using
available CIMIS data to determine correction factors to estimate CIMIS
ETo from the HS ETo to account for spatial climate differences.
Cal-SIMETAW also employs near real-time reference evapotranspiration
(ETo) information from Spatial CIMIS, which is a model that combines
weather station data and remote sensing to provide a grid of ETo
information. A second database containing the available soil water
holding capacity and soil depth information for all of California was
also developed from the USDA-NRCS SSURGO database. The Cal-SIMETAW
program also has the ability to generate daily weather data from monthly
mean values for use in studying climate change scenarios and their
possible impacts on water demand in the state. The key objective of this
project is to improve the accuracy of water use estimates for the
California Water Plan (CWP), which provides a comprehensive report on
water supply, demand, and management in California. In this paper, we
will discuss the model and how it determines ETaw for use in water
resources planning.

N2  - Chickpea cropping system is largely rainfed and terminal drought is a major constraint to its productivity. Currently available drought tolerant chickpea genotypes are very few. Considering that a large number of traits are collectively needed to confer yield under drought, there is a need to identify more genotypes to introduce diversity in drought tolerance breeding programs. The minicore (n=211) chickpea germplasm collection has been evaluated over three years for drought tolerance index (DTI), calculated as the standard residuals, through a regression approach considering drought yield as a function of days to flowering, yield potential and the residual or drought response, in the short season environment of South-India. The minicore collection accessions exhibited large range of variations for days to 50% flowering (26–78 d) and maturity (70–120 d), shoot biomass (1500–4940kgha−1) and seed yield (210–2730kgha−1) under drought. The heritability for the shoot biomass and seed yields under drought stress (shoot biomass 0.118–0.461; seed yield 0.511–0.795) were relatively higher than that under optimally irrigated environment (shoot biomass 0.232–0.447; seed yield 0.322–0.631). Both the seed yield under drought and DTI showed significant accession×year interaction. A categorization of the DTI using a cluster analysis has revealed five major groups with 5 accessions in highly tolerant group, 78 in tolerant, 74 in moderately tolerant, 39 in sensitive and 20 in highly sensitive groups. ICC 4958, a previously identified drought tolerant genotype, was among the moderately tolerant while Annigeri, a well-adapted cultivar, was in the tolerant group. Though the heritability of DTI was slightly lesser than that of the yield, the DTI represented terminal drought tolerance per se, and was independent of phenology and yield potential influences.

N2  - Fresh produce that is contaminated with viruses may lead to infection and viral gastroenteritis or hepatitis when consumed raw. It is thus important to reduce virus numbers on these foods. Prevention of virus contamination in fresh produce production and processing may be more effective than treatment, as sufficient virus removal or inactivation by post-harvest treatment requires high doses that may adversely affect food quality. To date knowledge of the contribution of various potential contamination routes is lacking. A risk assessment model was developed for human norovirus, hepatitis A virus and human adenovirus in raspberry and salad vegetable supply chains to quantify contributions of potential contamination sources to the contamination of produce at retail. These models were used to estimate public health risks. Model parameterization was based on monitoring data from European supply chains and literature data. No human pathogenic viruses were found in the soft fruit supply chains; human adenovirus (hAdV) was detected, which was additionally monitored as an indicator of fecal pollution to assess the contribution of potential contamination points. Estimated risks per serving of lettuce based on the models were 3×10−4 (6×10−6–5×10−3) for NoV infection and 3×10−8 (7×10−10–3×10−6) for hepatitis A jaundice. The contribution to virus contamination of hand-contact was larger as compared with the contribution of irrigation, the conveyor belt or the water used for produce rinsing. In conclusion, viral contamination in the lettuce and soft fruit supply chains occurred and estimated health risks were generally low. Nevertheless, the 97.5% upper limit for the estimated NoV contamination of lettuce suggested that infection risks up to 50% per serving might occur. Our study suggests that attention to full compliance for hand hygiene will improve fresh produce safety related to virus risks most as compared to the other examined sources, given the monitoring results. This effect will be further aided by compliance with other hygiene and water quality regulations in production and processing facilities.

N2  - The high solubility of carbon dioxide precludes significant desorption within commercial oxygen absorption equipment. This operating characteristic of the equipment limits its application in recirculating water culture systems despite its ability to significantly increase allowable fish loading rates (kg/(Lmin)). Carbon dioxide (DC) is typically removed by air stripping. This process requires a significant energy input for forced air movement, air heating in cold climates and water pumping. We developed a modification for a spray tower that provides for carbon dioxide desorption as well as oxygen absorption. Elimination of the air-stripping step reduces pumping costs while allowing dissolved nitrogen to drop below saturation concentrations. This latter response provides for an improvement in oxygen absorption efficiency within the spray tower. DC desorption is achieved by directing head-space gases from the spray tower (O2, N2, CO2) through a sealed packed tower scrubber receiving a 2N NaOH solution. Carbon dioxide is selectively removed from the gas stream, by chemical reaction, forming the product Na2CO3. Scrubber off-gas, lean with regard to carbon dioxide but still rich with oxygen, is redirected through the spray tower for further stripping of DC and absorption of oxygen. Make-up NaOH is metered into the scrubbing solution sump on an as needed basis as directed by a feedback control loop programmed to maintain a scrubbing solution pH of 11.4–11.8. The spent NaOH solution is collected, then regenerated for reuse, in a batch process that requires relatively inexpensive hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2). A by-product of the regeneration step is an alkaline filter cake, which may have use in bio-solids stabilization. Given the enhanced gas transfer rates possible with chemical reaction, the required NaOH solution flow rate through the scrubber represents a fraction of the spray tower water flow rate. Further, isolation of the water being treated from the atmosphere (1), allows for an improvement in oxygen absorption efficiency by maintaining DN well below local saturation concentrations (2), minimizes building energy requirements related to heating and ventilation and (3), reduces the potential for pathogen transmittance. We report on the performance of a test scrubber evaluated over a range of NaOH solution temperatures, pH, packing irrigation rates, and gas stream compositions. We also describe our experience with the process in a pilot scale recirculating water (trout) production system.

N2  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the key factors limiting maize
(Zea mays L.) productivity in eastern India to develop effective crop
and nutrient management strategies to reduce yield gap. A series of farm
surveys was conducted in two distinct agro-ecological zones of eastern
India to evaluate the importance of crop management and structural
constraints for maize productivity in a range of socio-economic settings
prevalent in smallholder farms. Surveys revealed yield gap and yield
variations among farms across growing seasons. Lower yields of farmers
were mainly associated with farmer's ethnic origin, availability of
family labor, land ownership, legumes in cropping sequence, irrigation
constraints, seed type, optimal plant population, labor and capital
investment, and use of organic manure. These constraints varied strongly
between sites as well as growing seasons. Stochastic Frontier Analysis
suggested intensification of farm input use and removal of
socio-economic and structural constraints for increasing efficiency in
maize production. The use of multivariate classification and regression
tree analysis revealed that maize yield was affected by multiple and
interacting production constraints, differentiating the surveyed farms
in six distinct resource groups. These farm types lend scope for
introducing typology-specific crop management practices through
appropriate participatory on-farm evaluation/trials. Summarily, this
research indicated that interacting production constraints should be
addressed simultaneously, considering the need of different farm types,
if significant productivity improvements are to be achieved. This will
be, however, more challenging for less endowed farms due to lack of
social and financial capital to improve management intensity. A
typology-specific farm support strategy may be formulated to offset this
lack of entitlement among resource-poor farmers. (C) 2014 Royal

N2  - The EU-Rotate_N and the CropSyst simulation models were evaluated in a Mediterranean climate with two leafy vegetable crops, lettuce and escarole, to simulate (i) dry matter production (DMP), (ii) crop N uptake, (iii) marketable crop production, (iv) soil water content (SWC) and (vi) soil mineral N. Nitrogen (N) treatments were examined in three years with differences in N dose. Relevant parameters were calibrated in both models, especially in the CropSyst simulation model which had not been used before for leafy vegetable crops. For both lettuce and escarole, the EU-Rotate_N model accurately simulated DMP, marketable crop production, crop N uptake and soil mineral N. Simulation of SWC with EU-Rotate_N was statistically acceptable for the upper soil layer for both crops. However, during a rainy period at the end of the escarole crop, SWC was overestimated. In both, lettuce and escarole, the performance of CropSyst to simulate DMP and crop N uptake was acceptable; however, it was consistently poorer than with EU-Rotate_N. In lettuce, CropSyst had a tendency to overestimate DMP and crop N uptake under conditions of no N application (N0), and to overestimate soil mineral N in the N fertilizer treatments, especially at harvest. In escarole, the simulation of marketable production with CropSyst was poor. In lettuce, simulations of SWC with CropSyst resulted in unacceptable results suggesting the need for CropSyst to be adapted for drip irrigated vegetable crops. Soil mineral N simulations were poorer with CropSyst than with EU-Rotate_N. The results of this work suggest that the overall performance of EU-Rotate_N was superior to CropSyst in both lettuce and escarole in the conditions of SE Spain. The KNS system was used in combination with the EU-Rotate_N model to optimize N management of lettuce. Crop N fertilizer requirements using the KNS system were determined by using simulations with EU-Rotate_N of both crop N uptake and soil mineral N, and the selection of N buffer levels that ensured no commercial yield or quality losses. In the optimal scenario (defined as that which maximized yield with the smaller N application) N fertilizer was reduced by 57% compared to local practices. In addition, soil mineral N and N leaching were reduced by 61% and 57%, respectively, compared to growers' management. This methodology proved to be a useful and easy tool to be used as a Decision Support System (DSS) to program N fertilization in drip fertigated lettuce.

N1  - Investigation of Coastal Aquifers
N2  - This study characterizes the near-shore portion of the shallow coastal aquifer included in the Ravenna area (Northern Italy) with special attention to the roles of coastal dunes as freshwater reservoirs and their buffer on groundwater salinity. The paper focuses on the presence and evolution of freshwater lenses below coastal dunes and highlights the existing differences between preserved natural dunes and dunes strongly affected by human intervention. The influence that multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, such as land cover, local drainage network, and beach erosion have on the presence, size and evolution of the freshwater lenses in the aquifer is quantified and discussed. The methodology includes multiple seasonal monitoring and sampling campaigns of physical (water level, salinity, and temperature) and chemical (major cations and anions) groundwater parameters. Results indicate that freshwater lenses, where existing, are limited in thickness (about 1–2m). Proximity to drainage ditches as well as limited dune elevation and size do not allow the formation and permanent storage of large freshwater lenses in the aquifer below the dunes. The pine forest land cover, that replaced the typical bush or sand cover, intensifies evapotranspiration reducing net infiltration and freshwater storage. The cation species distribution in the water shows that a freshening process is ongoing in preserved natural sites with stable or advancing beaches, whereas a salinization process is ongoing in anthropogenic-impacted areas with strongly-fragmented dune systems. Currently, the thin freshwater lenses in the shallow Ravenna coastal aquifer are limited in space and have no relevance for irrigation or any other human activity. The dune-beach system, however, is the recharge zone of the coastal aquifer and its protection is important to reduce water and soil salinization, which in turn control the health of the whole coastal ecosystem.

N1  - European Conference on DESALINATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT WATER SHORTAGE
N2  - One of the major options for the remedy of water shortages in the Gaza Strip of Palestine, and the protection of its coastal aquifer from either depletion and/or becoming saline, is the utilization of desalination technology for brackish and seawater in that region. Other effective options for water supply may become feasible after a comprehensive peace prevails in the region. As a means of an immediate remedy to fresh water shortages in cities in central and southern Gaza and water conflict resolution, the donor countries have funded 3 relatively small brackish water reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants, each of which produces between 45 and 75 m3/h. Two private Palestinian water investing companies also established two similar RO plants. Several other much larger seawater RO desalination plants are planned to cover the overall shortages in the whole Gaza Strip and allow time to restore and rejuvenate the polluted and saline Gaza aquifer. The Gaza Strip with its low rainfall and sandy soils depends greatly on its intensive agriculture production on irrigation resulting in an over utilization of the underground water resources. The high water withdrawal through about 4000, mostly unregulated, private farm wells with a capacity of 20–80m3/h and 95 municipality wells of 60–100 m3/h, and lack of sufficient natural recharge is causing a deterioration of the valuable coastal aquifer system in the Gaza Strip. Discussion will entail the USAID many faceted assistance programs to rehabilitate the Gaza aquifers and investigate the options for alleviating the water shortages in the Gaza Strip. USAID allocated and began collaboration with the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) on a USA grant of US$10M yearly, over 5 years, which is currently being implemented through the USA consulting firm of Metcalf and Eddy. Currently, desalination by RO of the abundant supplies of brackish water around the cities in central and southern Gaza, which may be appealing as an emergency alternative water source, is causing through the brine disposal, long range environmental problems, and through intensive underground water withdrawals, a lowering of the water table and encroachment of seawater and other brackish water intrusion into the fresh water aquifer. Furthermore, the brine disposal from the private desalination plants and the small private RO water vendors are a menacing and uncontrolled environmental problem in the Gaza Strip.

N2  - Increasing scarcity of resources (labour, water, and energy) and cost of
production, along with climate variability, are major challenges for the
sustainability of rice-wheat system in the northwesten Indo-Gangetic
Plains (IGP). We hypothesized that adopting the principles of
conservation agriculture together with best crop management practices
would improve system productivity and overall efficiency, resulting in a
higher profitability. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the
performance of four cropping system scenarios (treatments), which were
designed to be adapted to current and future drivers of agricultural
changes. The treatments including farmers practices varied in tillage
and crop establishment methods, residue management, crop sequence, and
crop management. Zero-tillage direct-seeded rice (ZT-DSR) with residue
retention and best management practices provided equivalent or higher
yield and 30-50% lower irrigation water use than those of
farmer-managed puddled transplanted rice (CT-TPR). Overall, net economic
returns increased up to 79% with a net reduction in production cost of
up to US$ 55 ha(-1) in ZT-DSR than CT-TPR. Substituting rice with ZT
maize was equally profitable but with 88-95% less irrigation water use.
Avoiding puddling in rice and dry tillage in maize with residue
retention increased yield (by 0.5-1.2 t ha(-1)) and net economic returns
of the succeeding wheat crop. Inclusion of mungbean in the rotation
further increased system productivity and economic returns. In summary,
our initial results of 2-year field study showed positive effects of
CA-based improved management practices on yield and system efficiencies
with greater benefits in the second year. There is a need of longer term
monitoring to quantify cumulative effects of various interventions and
to eventually make recommendations for wider dissemination. (C) 2013

N2  - Cropping of maize (Zea mays L.) on sandy soil in wet climates involves a significant risk for nitrogen (N) losses, since nitrate added in fertilizers or produced from residues and manure may be lost outside the period with active crop N uptake. This one-year lysimeter experiment investigated the potential of Vizura®, a formulation for liquid manure (slurry) with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3−) leaching from a coarse sandy soil cropped with maize. Maize followed grass-clover (Lolium perenne L.-Trifolium pratense L.) with spring incorporation and was fertilised with cattle slurry. A total of 12 treatments in triplicate were included in a factorial experiment with 1 m2 large and 1.4 m deep lysimeters: 1) with or without spraying the above-ground biomass of grass-clover with DMPP before incorporation; 2) application of cattle manure with or without DMPP, or no fertilization; and 3) natural rainfall or extra rain events to represent wet spring conditions, which were simulated with an automated and programmable irrigation system. Around 20 kg N ha−1 was returned to the soil in grass-clover above-ground biomass, and 145 kg N ha−1 in cattle manure. Cumulative annual N2O emissions ranged from 0.4 to 1.3 kg N ha−1, with between 49 and 86% of emissions occurring during spring. Manure application increased N2O emissions, while extra rainfall had no effect. The mitigation of N2O emissions by DMPP ranged from 46 to 67% under natural, and from 44 to 48% under high rainfall conditions. Total annual NO3− leaching ranged from 65 to 162 kg N ha−1. The extent of NO3− leaching to 1.4 m depth during spring was low, and instead most (72–83%) of total annual NO3−-N leaching was recorded during autumn before harvest. The extra rainfall during spring increased NO3−-N leaching in the pre-harvest period, but it is not clear to what extent this was associated with the N in grass-clover residues or manure applied in spring, or from N mineralisation below the root zone. Despite evidence for a reduction of NO3− leaching in three of four scenarios, overall this effect was not significant. No DMPP was detected in leachates. In conclusion, DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions from cattle manure on this sandy loam soil independent of rainfall, while there was no significant effect on NO3− leaching. The results indicate that N2O emissions and NO3−-N leaching were partly derived from below-ground sources of N not affected by DMPP, which should be further investigated to better predict the mitigation potential of nitrification inhibitors.

N2  - To assess the scope for enhancing productivity of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), the CROPGRO-Soybean model was calibrated and validated for the diverse soybean-growing environments of central and peninsular India. The validated model was used to estimate potential yields (water non-limiting and water limiting) and yield gaps of soybean for 21 locations representing major soybean regions of India. The average water non-limiting potential yield of soybean for the locations was 3020kgha−1, while the water limiting potential was 2170kgha−1 indicating a 28% reduction in yield due to adverse soil moisture conditions. As against this, the actual yields of locations averaged 1000kgha−1, which was 2020 and 1170kgha−1 less than the water non-limiting potential and water limiting potential yields, respectively. Across locations the water non-limiting potential yields were less variable than water limited potential and actual yields, and strongly correlated with solar radiation during the season (R2=0.83, p≤0.01). Both simulated water limiting potential yield (R2=0.59, p≤0.01) and actual yield (R2=0.33, p≤0.05) had significant but positive and curvilinear relationships with crop season rainfall across locations. The gap between water non-limiting and water limiting potential yields was very large at locations with low crop season rainfall and narrowed down at locations with increasing quantity of crop season rainfall. On the other hand, the gap between water limiting potential yield and actual farmers yield was narrow at locations with low crop season rainfall and increased considerably at locations with increasing amounts of rainfall. This yield gap, which reflects the actual yield gap in rainfed environment, is essentially due to non-adoption of improved crop management practices and could be reduced if proper interventions are made. The simulation study suggested that conservation of rainfall and drought resistant varieties in low rainfall regimes; and alleviation of water-logging and use of water-logging tolerant varieties in high rainfall regimes will be the essential components of improved technologies aimed at reducing the yield gaps of soybean. Harvesting of excess rainfall during the season and its subsequent use as supplemental irrigation would further help in increasing crop yields at most locations.

N1  - Human Impact and Geomorphology in Tropical Mountain Areas
N2  - Upland watershed rehabilitation programmes in Indonesia have faced increased scrutiny for not delivering the desired reductions in downstream sedimentation rates. Partly this reflects the fact that conservation measures have not been widely adopted or maintained by upland farmers, mainly for socio-economic reasons. Another potential explanation is that sediment contributions by gullying, (riparian) mass wasting and bank erosion have been seriously underestimated or even ignored. This paper presents estimates of sediment contributions by gullies, riparian mass wasting and bank erosion in the upland volcanic Konto catchment, East Java. Runoff and sediment yield from gullies were studied in two areas with contrasting soils and land use. Gullies in the Maron area (few gullies, Andic Cambisols, maize and rice cultivation on stable broad-based terraces) were related to improper drainage of trails, roads and yards. In the Binangsri area (more widespread gullying, Eutric Cambisols, onion cultivation on forward-sloping terraces), gullying was further enhanced by the practice of downslope furrowing to promote field drainage. Estimated annual sediment yields from the two areas were strikingly different at 22–26 and 50–87 Mg ha−1, respectively. Riparian mass wasting was estimated to contribute ca. 4% of total sediment yield at Maron and 8–19% in the main gully system at Binangsri, with the higher value in the latter case representing the effect of extreme rainfall in the latter half of the rainy season. Short-term wet season rates of gully wall retreat at Binangsri suggested a contribution by bank erosion of ca. 3% (8% including extreme events). As such, 11–27% of the annual sediment yield at Binangsri was estimated to have come from sources other than surface erosion. Substantial volumes of sediment (29–107 Mg km−1 of river length) were also added to streams bordered by irrigated rice fields (sawah) in non-gullied areas, mainly through the collapse of the lowermost terraces due to undercutting.

N2  - Caliciviridae, including norovirus, are considered important sources of human gastroenteritis. As leafy green vegetables are commonly consumed without additional processing, it is important to evaluate interventions to reduce the presence of human pathogens in these products. Feline calicivirus was used as a model for small round structured viruses on lettuce. The lettuce was inoculated by immersion to simulate contamination from irrigation or wash water. The inoculated lettuce was then exposed to electron beam irradiation at various dose levels to determine survival. The D10-value of the calicivirus on lettuce was determined to be 2.95 kGy. Irradiation to reduce bacterial pathogens on cut lettuce could also reduce the risk associated with small round structured viruses on lettuce. Received 14 March 2011 Accepted 21 April 2011 From a food safety perspective, noroviruses, members of the family Caliciviridae, are responsible for widespread foodborne illnesses. They have been classified in the highest priority group of foodborne pathogens, and they are considered the most common foodborne virus (8). In the United States, it is estimated that there are more than 20 million cases of norovirus-associated foodborne illness every year (13). Produce including spinach and lettuce could become contaminated with norovirus either during growth, from contaminated water, or during processing and serving, by infected food handlers. Because these leafy green vegetables are often consumed without any further processing, it is prudent to investigate interventions that may lessen the chance of human infection by these foods. In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule on the use of irradiation for spinach and lettuce, stating, “ . . . FDA concludes that the proposed use of irradiation to treat iceberg lettuce and spinach with absorbed doses that will not exceed 4.0 kGy is safe” (18). The final rule was in response to three multistate outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 traced to spinach and lettuce (3). Although the focus of this final rule was on bacterial contamination, it is possible that irradiation at the approved dose levels could potentially affect enteric virus populations as well. Several researchers have studied the inactivation of caliciviruses (a.k.a., small round structured viruses [SRSVs]) on surfaces and on foods. Slomka and Appleton (14) and Duizer et al. (7) demonstrated obvious time and temperature relationships in the inactivation of these viruses in molluscan shellfish and in water. Gulati et al. (9) evaluated the effectiveness of three commonly used disinfectants on strawberries and lettuce inoculated with feline calicivirus. Ozone (16), UV irradiation (17), and gamma irradiation (2) have also been shown to have various destructive effects on viruses in water or on food surfaces. All of these technologies have advantages and disadvantages from a processing perspective, and each could be of value in a specific processing operation or food service system. Since noroviruses are significant causes of human gastroenteritis, with very low infectious doses and do not readily grow in cell culture, researchers have looked for a similar virus to use as a surrogate for laboratory studies. Slomka and Appleton (14) suggested the use of feline calicivirus (FCV) as a surrogate for Norwalk virus in their research on heat inactivation of the virus in molluscan shellfish. Other researchers, including Doultree et al. (6), Gulati et al. (9), Mattison et al. (11), Thurston-Enriquez et al. 16., 17., and Duizer et al. (7), have also used FCV as a surrogate for SRSVs with foods and food surfaces. More recently, murine norovirus has been used as a surrogate for human norovirus on lettuce (1). However, from a research perspective, FCV appears to be an adequate surrogate for norovirus and other small, round structured human enteric viruses. Although gamma irradiation has been shown to be effective in reducing the populations of caliciviruses in foods, there is currently nothing in the scientific literature documenting the effects of electron beam irradiation. Although the results of the different irradiation sources would be assumed to be similar, electron beam irradiation has advantages from a processing perspective, in part because of a higher product throughput at a given dose. A disadvantage of electron beam irradiation, in comparison with gamma irradiation, is that electron beam irradiation has a relatively small depth of penetration. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between electron beam irradiation and the inactivation of norovirus on leafy green vegetables, in the context of the approval of irradiation as a decontamination strategy for lettuce and spinach.

N2  - A five-year groundwater monitoring program undertaken in Evros (north-east Greece), showed a diversification in the levels of pesticide residues detected in adjacent transboundary aquifers. During the first two years 37 wells, including irrigation, drinking water and artesian wells were monitored while the next three years the survey was focused on the 11 most contaminated wells. The presence of pesticide residues was also monitored in the phreatic horizon (shallow groundwater) of four experimental boreholes drilled in the respective margins of four fields. Among the compounds found alachlor, metolachlor, atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), desisopropylatrazine (DIA) and caffeine were constantly detected. Pesticide concentrations were much lower (up to 1.54μg/L) in the water of the monitored drinking water wells (deep groundwater aquifers) compared to those found in the phreatic horizon (experimental boreholes) of the respective areas (up to 5.20μg/L). DEA to atrazine concentration ratios (DAR) determined for the phreatic horizon of the three boreholes and respective wells were lower than 1, indicating that preferential flow was the cause of the fast downward movement of atrazine to the phreatic horizon. In contrast the DAR for the fourth borehole and the adjacent well were greater than 1 indicating the absence of preferential flow of atrazine. Catabolic processes of the soil converted atrazine to DEA which is more mobile than atrazine itself through chromatographic (darcian) flow. This differential behavior of pesticides in adjacent aquifers (3km) was further investigated by determining the apparent age of water in the two wells. The apparent age of the water present in the first aquifer was 21.7years whereas the apparent age of that in the second aquifer was approximately 1.2years. The faster replenishing rate of the latter is an indication that this aquifer is very vulnerable to contamination with pollutants present in the infiltrated soil water.

N2  - Seven genotypes of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) were used in carrying out half diallel cross, 21 F1 hybrids and 21 F2 progenies evaluated under well watered and rainfed conditions at the Maryout Agriculture Experimental Station of Desert Research Center. Mean squares of genotypes in F1 and F2 generations showed that the differences due to genotypes were significant for all characters studied under well watered and rainfed conditions. The four parental genotypes; P2, P4, P5 and P6 were the earliest in days to 50% flowering and recorded values raging from 30.88 to 47.98days under well watered and rainfed conditions and the two crosses; P1×P3 and P2×P7 in both generations under the two treatments. The parental genotype P2 recorded the highest number of branches per plant (7.85 and 6.94 branches) under well watered and rainfed treatments, respectively. While, the two crosses; P2×P4 and P2×P6 recorded the highest number of pods per plant in both generations under well watered and rainfed treatments. For 100-seed weight the parent Aquadulce (P4) recorded the highest values under well watered and rainfed conditions (95.62 and 71.72g, respectively). As well as the two crosses; P2×P5 and P2×P6 recorded the highest values for seed yield per plant. Significant positive heterosis and heterobeltiosis were detected for different traits; With respect to seed yield per plant, the seven crosses; P1×P7, P2×P5, P2×P6, P4×P6, P5×P6, P5×P7 and P6×P7 had significant positive heterotic effects relative to mid and better parents under the two irrigation treatments. Mean squares of both GCA and SCA estimates were highly significant or significant in both generations for all the studied traits under well watered and rainfed conditions. Variances due to GCA were larger than those for SCA and exceeded the unity were detected for days to 50% flowering in F1 generation under rainfed conditions, No. of branches per plant, No. of pods per plant in both treatments and generations except for F1 generation under rainfed condition, 100-seed weight in both treatments and generations except for the F1 generation under well watered conditions and seed yield per plant in both treatments and generations except for the F2 generation under well watered and rainfed conditions, revealing that the largest part of the total genetic variance associated with different traits being the result of additives types on gene action. General combining ability results showed that the three parental genotypes (P1 (G.461), (P2 (NBL2) and P4 (Aquadulce)) were good combiners for improving most studied traits. Such combinations might have desirable transgressive segregations, provided that the additive genetic system is present in different crosses for increasing plant yield and its components under targeted well watered and rainfed conditions. For SCA, the desirable inter-and intra-allelic interactions were presented in the cross P6×P7 in the two generations under both treatments along with P1×P2 in the F2 generation under both treatments, P1×P5 in F1 and F2 generations under well watered and rainfed conditions respectively, P1×P6, P2×P5 and P4×P6 in F1 under both treatments and the three crosses; P1×P7, P3×P4 and P3×P5 in F1 generation under well watered conditions showed significant positive effects for 100-seed weight. Moreover, seven F1′ P1×P7 in both generations and under the two treatments, P1×P4 in the F1 generation under well watered conditions, P2×P5, P2×P6, P4×P6 and P5×P7 under F1 generation under both treatments and P6×P7 in the F2 generation under rainfed conditions possessed significant positive effects for seed yield per plant. These crosses might be of interest in breeding programs to produce pure lines while most of them involve at least one good combiner for the trait in view.

N2  - Water trading has become a key water scarcity risk-management tool for irrigators. Effective and enduring water trade systems require approaches that can cope with dynamic complexity and enable the inclusion of multiple stakeholders. Previous efforts to improve water trade systems have largely focused on reductionist approaches, which examine system components in isolation neglecting their interconnected nature. Such approaches to water trade system assessment are at risk of maladaptation resulting in increased market inefficiencies, transaction costs and market failure through barriers to participation. Using a systems thinking approach, we develop a conceptual model of a generalised water trade system in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin (MDB or the Basin). The model visualises the Basin's water trade systems as a whole and identifies feedback mechanisms likely to influence trade development and endurance. We argue that such a conceptual model provides an effective communication tool for achieving a better understanding of market dynamics and alignment of stakeholder priorities to improve enduring market use. It can also serve as an assessment/evaluation tool for water trade policy and identify key leverage points for systemic interventions.

N1  - The assessment of soil quality
N2  - Salt-affected soils could produce useful forages when irrigated with saline drainage water. To assess the productive potential and sustainability of using drainage water for forage production, a saline-sodic site (32.4 ha) in California's San Joaquin Valley was characterized for soil quality. The objectives were (1) to spatially characterize initial soil physicochemical properties relevant to maintaining soil quality on an arid zone soil and (2) to characterize soil quality relationships and spatial variability. An initial mobile electromagnetic (EM) induction survey was conducted in 1999, with bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) readings taken at 384 geo-referenced locations, followed by an intensive mobile fixed-array survey with a total of 7288 geo-referenced ECa readings. Using the EM data and a spatial statistics program (ESAP v2.0), 40 sites were selected that reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the ECa measurements for the study area. At these sites, soil-core samples were taken at 0.3-m intervals to a depth of 1.2 m. Duplicate samples were taken at eight sites to study the local-scale variability of soil properties. Soil-core samples were analyzed for a variety of physical and chemical properties related to the soil quality of arid zone soils. Soils were found to be highly spatially heterogeneous. For composite soil-core samples taken to a depth of 1.2 m, ECe (electrical conductivity of the saturation extract) varied from 12.8 to 36.6 dS m−1, SAR from 28.8 to 88.8, and clay content from 2.5% to 48.3%. B and Mo concentrations varied from 11.5 to 32.2 mg l−1 and 476.8 to 1959.6 μg l−1, respectively. CaCO3, NO3− in the saturation extract, exchangeable Ca2+, Se, and As consistently had the highest coefficients of variation (CV) while pHe, ρb, and Ca2+ in the saturation extract consistently had the lowest CVs at all depths. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to spatially partition the local- and global-scale variability. Local-scale variability was greatest for pHe. Laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were very low (0.0000846–0.0456 cm h−1), whereas field measurements were considerably higher (0.49–1.79 cm h−1). Based on the Cl− data, the leaching fraction (LF) for the entire study area was estimated to be 17%. Soil quality was reflected in yield and chemical analysis of forage. Forage Mo contents determined from newly established Bermuda grass varied from 1 to 5 mg kg−1 on a dry matter basis, and Cu/Mo ratios averaged 3.3, while forage yield in the establishment year declined with ECe, and failed to grow above ECe levels of approximately 22 dS m−1. The initial soil quality assessment of the research site indicated that the sustainability of drainage water reuse at this location would depend upon maintaining a sufficient LF with careful consideration and management of salinity, boron, molybdenum, and sodium levels.

N2  - Human norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of fresh produce-associated outbreaks and human NoV in irrigation water can potentially lead to viral internalization in fresh produce. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel intervention strategies to target internalized viral pathogens while maintaining fresh produce quality. In this study electron beam (E-beam) and gamma radiation were evaluated for efficacy against a human NoV GII.4 strain and Tulane virus (TV). Virus survival following ionizing radiation treatments was determined using direct quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), the porcine gastric mucin magnetic bead (PGM-MB) binding assay followed by RT-qPCR, and plaque assay. In simple media, a high dose of E-beam treatment was required to completely abolish the receptor binding ability of human NoV (35.3kGy) and TV (19.5–24.1kGy), as assessed using the PGM-MB binding assay. Both human NoV and TV were more susceptible to gamma irradiation than E-beam, requiring 22.4kGy to achieve complete inactivation. In whole strawberries, no human NoV or TV RNA was detected following 28.7kGy of E-beam treatment using the PGM-MB binding assay. Overall, human NoV and TV are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and therefore the technology may not be suitable to eliminate viruses in fresh produce at the currently approved levels. In addition, the PGM-MB binding assay is an improved method to detect viral infectivity compared to direct RT-qPCR.

N2  - The importance of indigenous knowledge is being increasingly realized for identifying sustainable interventions enabling environmental conservation coupled with socio-economic development of local communities. This study aimed to evaluate livestock diet composition, diet overlap, forage selection and livestock husbandry and associated land use practices in a typical traditional village landscape in the cold arid region of the trans-Himalaya, India. The village territory (4300–4600m amsl.) was differentiated into (i) irrigated cropping on terraced slopes, (ii) meadows valued for hay and mulch material and (iii) meadows grazed by cows, non-lactating dzomos (female offspring of cow–yak cross), goats, donkeys and sheep. The traditional livestock husbandry and grazing management practices included: (i) dependence of livestock almost exclusively on grazing during summer (May–September) and on stall feeding during winter (November–March), (ii) regulation of utilization of hay and mulch material by the village council, (iii) divison of grazing area into blocks, each grazed for 5–7 days followed by an equally long rest phase and (iv) regulation of animal movements by herders such that donkeys did not mix with other animals and all animals spent almost equal foraging time in moist depressions dominated by graminoids and dry slopes by legumes and forbs. The livestock types did not differ significantly in respect of foraging period and bite rate. Bite size and daily forage intake of goats and sheep were markedly lower but search cost higher as compared to those of dzomos, donkeys and cows. Sheep and goats foraged on all plant species, while Astragalus zanskarensis was excluded by cows, Caragana versicolor by cows and dzomos and Thermopsis inflata and Potentilla fruticosa by cows, dzomos and donkeys. Goats showed the highest degree of selection for T. inflata and all other livestock types for Carex infuscata. The highest level of similarity in diet composition during grazing was observed between sheep and goats followed by that between donkeys and cows. Goats and dzomos showed the highest diet breadth value (0.73) followed by sheep (0.53) and cows or donkeys (0.44). The bulk of stall-feed comprised the species that were not preferred during grazing. Local people consider Cousinia thomsonii and Cicer microphyllum to be the best quality winter feed for all livestock. Thermopsis inflata was considered harmful to dzomos, cows and donkeys and Seseli trilobum to dzomos and cows. People do not harvest C. versicolor, a poor forage but an excellent fuelwood species, from village lands as they consider it as a ‘keystone’ species facilitating regeneration and growth of high-quality forage species. The traditional land use and animal husbandry systems need to be improved with appropriate scientific and institutional inputs to meet the challenges arising from market forces on one hand and environmental conservation on the other.

N2  - Soil salinization in the lower reaches of Amudarya is a constant threat. High seepage losses in irrigation water delivery network and deteriorated drainage network result in rising groundwater tables. The shallow groundwater table contributes to salinization of the rooting zone which is tackled by leaching at the end or beginning of the vegetation season. However, there is growing concern that the efficiency of the leaching with application of high amounts of water is low, and besides that the leaching effects are not long-lasting. To monitor local soil salinity an efficient strategy is developed, using electromagnetic induction (EMI) meter measurements. The monitoring strategy is applied and evaluated in a case study in Uzbekistan. The study area of 80ha was surveyed in 2008–2011, at the end of the vegetation season (October–November), with the EMI in vertical dipole mode. In addition, at 142 calibration locations (including 28 revisited) both EMI was recorded and the soil was sampled to determine electrical conductivity (ECe) in laboratory. Log-transformed values of EMI and ECe were used to fit a simple linear regression model. Maps of ECe at the four time points were obtained by simulating multiple maps of log(EMI) using the ordinary kriging model. Besides, multiple vectors of regression coefficients were simulated, which were used to transform the simulated log(EMI) maps. Finally, simulated maps of regression residuals were added to the transformed log(EMI) fields, and backtransformed. Besides maps with predicted ECe the simulations were used to derive maps of the probability that ECe exceeds the critical threshold of 8dSm−1, and a map of the predicted linear temporal trend in ECe. The results show that in 2008–2011 most of the area was not saline, with only several spots reaching a predicted ECe of 6dSm−1. The probabilities that ECe exceeds the critical threshold of 8dSm−1 were small, and the predicted percentage of the area where ECe exceeds this threshold was very small. At most places a slight positive linear trend in ECe was predicted, but this predicted local trend was not significant at most places. Two areas of concern could be distinguished. First, spots occur displaying pronounced fluctuations in salinity from year to year with peaks close to the critical threshold, suggesting that these areas might be prone to soil salinization over short periods of time. Second, in the central part of the area a gradual build-up of soil salinity was seen, which calls for interventions to halt or reverse the build-up.

N2  - This paper presents the results of engineering geological investigations and tunnel support design studies, carried out at the Sulakyurt dam site, northeast of Ankara, Turkey. The Sulakyurt dam will be used for flow control and water storage for irrigation projects. Studies were carried out both in the field and the laboratory. Field studies include engineering geological mapping, intensive discontinuity surveying, core drilling and sampling for laboratory testing. The diversion tunnel will be driven in rock mass, consisting of granite and diorite. Empirical, analytical and numerical methods were combined for safe tunnel design. Rock mass rating (RMR), Rock mass quality (Q) and Geological strength index (GSI) systems were used for empirical rock mass quality determination, site characterization and support design. The convergence–confinement method was used as analytical method and software called Phase2, a 2D finite element program, was utilized as numerical method. According to the results acquired from the empirical, analytical and numerical methods, tunnel stability problems were expected in both granite and diorite rock masses. The support system, suggested by empirical methods, was applied and the performance of suggested support system was evaluated by means of numerical modelling. It was concluded that the suggested support systems were adequate, since after applying the suggested support system to granite and diorite, tunnel deformation and the yielded elements around the tunnel decreased significantly. Thus, it is suggested that for more reliable support design empirical, numerical and analytical methods should be combined.

N1  - Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture
N2  - Water is critically important to the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people living on less than $1 a day, particularly for the 850 million rural poor primarily engaged in agriculture. In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear. This article provides a menu of promising pathways through which agricultural water management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction.

N2  - An understanding of the causes of genotype×environment (G×E) interactions is essential for the implementation of efficient selection and evaluation networks. Currently, studies involving the interpretation of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) G×E interactions are limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the relative influence of environmental factors on the G×E interactions of sugarcane under rainfed conditions in South Africa through a comprehensive analysis of a multi-environment trial (MET) dataset. Fifteen commercial cultivars were evaluated over 147 environments (trial×ratoon combinations) across the coastal (C), hinterland (H) and midlands (M) regions of the sugar industry. Environments were characterized according to five site covariates (soil depth, clay percentage, organic matter percentage, nitrogen mineralization category, and total available moisture) and nine seasonal covariates (time of harvest, age at harvest, average daily heat units, solar radiation, rainfall, evaporation, and three derived water stress indices). Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) biplots for cane yield (TCANE), estimated recoverable crystal percent (ERC) and tons ERC (TERC) revealed overlapping of C and H environments, while M environments formed unique clusters characterized by specific cultivar adaptabilities. Principal components analysis (PCA) allowed visualization of the covariates determining the regional separation patterns. AMMI interaction principal components axes (IPCA) 1 and 2 scores were correlated to the covariates and showed that harvest age, temperature, and water stress were mainly responsible for separation of M environments from C and H environments on the TCANE and TERC biplots. Time of harvest was identified as an important covariate influencing ERC G×E patterns in the C and H regions. The third water stress index (based on a ratio of observed yields to simulated irrigated yields) was a dominant factor influencing G×E patterns within the C and H regions and was identified as a superior indicator of water deficient environments for future studies. The M trials were characterized by shallower soils with lower total available moisture and greater variability in this regard compared with the C and H trials. Nitrogen mineralization category, organic matter percent, and clay percent were not significantly correlated to IPCA scores, while soil depth was identified as a major site selection criterion in the M region. The M region should be treated as a single mega-environment, while the C and H regions could be combined for future interpretive studies, where covariates should be summarized within growth phases. The results of this study will assist in restructuring the MET network through exploitation and targeting of the relevant environmental factors within the different regions.

N1  - Agriculture and Climate Change - Adapting Crops to Increased Uncertainty (AGRI 2015)
N2  - Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) is a vegetative propagated tropical root occupying the 9th position among world food crops. Taro is an important staple food for many local populations of Asia and Africa. The crop is dependent of wet and highly irrigated growth conditions. Under the scenario of undergoing climatic changes, is estimated that taro production could decrease in the next 30 years as result of drought constraints. The project EU Aid Taro, DCI-Food/2009/45 “adapting propagated crops to climatic and commercial changes” aims to study ways to adapt this clonally propagated root to these climatic changes. A set of drought stress assays were realized at ISOPlexis Genebank (Madeira University), using local taro cultivars (Macaronesian taro genepool) and elite cultivars and seedlings provided by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The 1st pilot assay was realized in a small greenhouse, included 3 local cultivars and aimed to modelate the wattering regimes and their influence on crop growth. The 2nd full assay was realized in two greenhouses, during a full plant growth cycle. Thirty four taro cultivars, 15 elite lines provided by SPC, and 19 local cultivars, from Madeira (10), Canary Islands (6), Azores (2), and Cyprus (1) were screened. Plants were individually cultivated in pots under 2 contrasting wattering regimes, high (0,36 liters/day) and low (0,18 liters/day). Data for 14 morpho-agronomic traits, biomass and yield parameters were collected from 5 plants for each cultivar, per treatment. Preliminary results show significant differences in the ability to cope with drought stress among elite and local varieties. A classification of cultivars according to their relative drougth tolerance was made. The most resilient of these varieties will be subject to a new complete assay, in order to better assess their level of tolerance and recommend for breeding programs in Asian countries.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between herd characteristics and the isolation of Salmonella from dairy cows in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Study farms were 129 conventional and organic farms enrolled without regard to previous history of Salmonella infection. Herds were sampled at 2-month intervals over a 1-year period. This is the largest study to date on Salmonella shedding in dairy cows and the only study evaluating herd-level risk factors using longitudinal sampling to characterize Salmonella shedding on dairy farms. Salmonella was isolated in fecal samples from 1026 (4.9%) of 20,089 cows. Over the course of the study, 113 (87.6%) of 129 farms had at least one positive cow sample. Multi-variable logistic regression using the generalized estimating equations approach was used to test the association between herd-level risk factors and the dependent variable of within-herd prevalence by visit (number of Salmonella-positive cows/number of cows sampled) after adjustment for effects of herd size, season, state of origin, and the multiple sampling occasions per herd. Factors retained in the final model included lack of use of tiestall or stanchion facilities to house lactating cows (OR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.1–3.3), not storing all purchased concentrate or protein feeds in an enclosed building (OR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.3–4.9), not using monensin in weaned calf or bred heifer diets (OR=3.2; 95% CI: 2.0–5.4), access of lactating or dry cows to surface water (e.g., lake, pond, river, or stream) (OR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.3–3.9), disposal of manure in liquid form (slurry or irrigation, as opposed to disposal of manure by broadcast/solid spreader only) on owned or rented land (OR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.3–3.9), and cows eating or grazing of roughage from fields where manure was applied in solid or liquid form and not plowed under during the same growing season (OR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.0–3.0). A seasonal association was also present as cows were more likely to be Salmonella-positive in summer, spring, and fall compared to winter. Herd size was not associated with Salmonella shedding in the final multi-variable model. The herd-level risk factors identified in this study could potentially be implemented in Salmonella control programs on dairy farms.

N1  - Biomass use trade-offs in cereal cropping systems:Lessons and implications from the developing world
N2  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is promoted as a promising technology to stabilize or improve crop yields in Africa and Madagascar. However, small-scale farmers face difficulties to retain soil cover, mainly because of competing uses for the biomass produced, especially to feed cattle. To explore the relation between dairy production and CA we developed an optimisation model at farm level. Our aim was to explore trade-offs between CA practices and the size of dairy cow herds. Our model includes three main components: the farm, the crops and the cattle herd. The optimisation was made on the total net income for three years. Biomass produced by cropping activities can either serve as mulch or to feed cows. We applied a constraint on the minimum soil cover % to keep at the end of each year for CA fields: from 30% to 95%. We simulated two scenarios of milk market: a small milk market with low forage price and an open milk market scenario with higher price of forage. Three prototypes of farms were simulated with different proportion and size of four kinds of field. These three prototypes were: medium-sized farm with hillsides dominating, medium-sized farm with paddy fields dominating and small-sized farm with hillsides. Changing the degree of soil cover to be retained on CA plots did not significantly modify the total net farm income. It was more strongly influenced by the characteristics of the milk market. In case of a limited milk market it was not profitable to have more than seven cows because the expenses were not compensated by animal production. When setting minimum soil cover to 30% then all of the simulated results include biomass coming from CA cropping system even with 12 cows/farm. Conversely when setting this constraint to 95%, above 6/7 cows/farm forage come only from conventional fields. In all of the situations simulated even with 6 cows, with the current and twice the price for forage, it was possible to keep at least 50% of soil cover on 30–60% of the total farm area. CA was not feasible for farms with no irrigated paddy fields or when forage fetched a high price regardless of the constraint for % of soil cover to be kept on CA fields. Overall, CA systems can be beneficial for dairy cow farmers due to the forage produced, although the milk market and thus the value of biomass for forage, has a strong influence on CA practice at field level.

N2  - Ongoing tectonic continental collision between the Indian subcontinent and Eurasia is the main driving force molding and creating snow- and rain-fed mountain watersheds and ground-water basins in Afghanistan. All large cities, as well as rural, agricultural-based populations of Afghanistan draw water from aquifers within tectonically controlled, alluvium-filled structural basins. The underlying geologic fabric controls ground-water occurrence and changing climate will dramatically change watershed natural conditions Also human-caused contamination and salinization of aquifers, recharge reduction along alluvial aquifers and canal systems, and overuse of fresh-water resources, negatively affect many downstream and cross-border rivers and alluvial aquifers. Conflict increases impacts by reducing government ability to control and manage aquifer over-pumping, especially from high capacity, engine-powered well pumps that supply water for illicit opium poppies. To overcome obstacles, first steps are to understand natural underlying geologic and hydrologic conditions and limitations controlling water availability. Sustainable approaches to managing water resources in Afghanistan must be directed by underlying natural conditions. Cities, populations, and economics will always be focused on these structurally controlled valleys and their alluvial aquifers. Relatively inexpensive, potable, and bacteriologically safe drinking water occurs in deep aquifers that cannot be ignored and developing this valuable resource correctly will significantly improve health and economics in Afghanistan. Technology to access water sources must be applied correctly because the new mud-lubricated, rotary drill-rigs can drill deeper, and with larger well pumps, can increase detrimental water withdrawals. Irrigation and watershed management programs for Afghanistan should use: (1) new passive-seismic technology to conduct inexpensive yet effective ground-water exploration, (2) mud-lubricated, rotary drilling techniques for Afghan cities, and (3) improved karez repair and rehabilitation. Robust governance, focused security, and capacity-building goals, based on underlying natural conditions and limitations, help reduce threats and improve downstream and transboundary water quality and quantity issues.

N2  - In Medicago truncatula Gaertn. cv. Jemalong plants some mechanisms involved in drought resistance were analysed in response to a progressive water deficit imposed by suppression of soil irrigation. Withholding water supply until the soil had reached one-half of its maximum water content had no significant effect on leaf RWC, gas exchanges or chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Under severe drought conditions, the plants resistance to water shortage involved mainly drought avoidance mechanisms through a decrease in stomatal conductance. The consequent decrease in the internal CO2 concentration (Ci) should have limited the net CO2 fixation (A). Since A decreased slightly more than Ci under severe water deficit, non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis may have also occurred. Analysis of A/Ci curves showed reduced carboxylation efficiency due to limitations in RuBP regeneration and Rubisco activity, confirming the presence of non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis. Drought tolerance mechanisms involving osmotic adjustment and an increase in cell membrane integrity were also present. Altogether, these mechanisms allowed M. truncatula cv. Jemalong plants to still maintain a quite elevated level of net CO2 fixation rate under severe water deficit conditions. These results may contribute to identify useful physiological traits for breeding programs concerning drought adaptation in legumes.

N2  - The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the major winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) producing areas in China. Current wheat yields in the NCP stabilize around 5Mgha−1 while the demand for wheat in China is growing due to the increase in population and the change in diet. Since options for area expansion of winter wheat are limited, the production per unit of area need to be increased. The objective of this study is to quantify the production potential of winter wheat in the NCP taking into account the spatial and temporal variability caused by climate. We use a calibrated crop growth simulation model to quantify wheat yields for potential and water-limited production situations using 40 years of weather data from 32 meteorological stations in the NCP. Simulation results are linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS) facilitating their presentation and contributing to the identification of hotspots for interventions aimed at yield improvements. In the northern part of the NCP, average simulated potential yields of winter wheat go up to 9.7Mgha−1, while average water-limited yields only reach 3Mgha−1. In the southern part of the NCP, both average potential and water-limited yields are about 7.5Mgha−1. Rainfall is the limiting factor to winter wheat yields in the northern part of the NCP, while in the southern part, the joint effect of low radiation and high temperature are major limiting factors. Temporal variation in potential yields throughout the NCP is low in contrast with the temporal variation in water-limited yields, which is especially great in the northern part. The study calls for the collection of location-specific and disaggregated irrigated and rainfed wheat yield statistics in the NCP facilitating the identification of hotspots for improvement of current wheat yields.

N2  - Man-made change in wetland ecosystems is mainly a 20th century process. Here, we report the changes over the last 55 years in the hydrology and botany of a Spanish semi-arid wetland, Las Tablas de Daimiel, a Ramsar site and a National Park. The landscape is valuable because of interesting waterfowl and plant species (particularly, Netta ruffina and Cladium mariscus) brought about by the fluctuations in water table arising from the interaction of surface flooding due to stream- and groundwater discharges and water retention by watermill dams. However, drainage reduced the wetland area to one seventh of its original value in 8 years between 1965 and 1973, and watermills were destroyed in the 1960s. Water pollution, mainly organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus, coming from point (towns and agroindustry) and non-point sources (agricultural practices in the watershed) started in the late 1970s and peaked by the middle of next decade, decreasing later as a result of newly-implemented, water treatment plants in the catchment area. Water availability was reduced greatly between the late 1970s and the 1990s because of irrigation programs in the catchment area, which exhausted the groundwater aquifer, and their effects on plants were mediated by decreasing yearly average flooding and its variability. The combined effect of increased eutrophication and decreased water inputs reduced the Cladium cover 10-fold, reduced the extent of Charophyte meadows and three quarters of hydrophyte species were lost. The reed (Phragmites communis) cover increased 22-fold. Later, a sudden increase in water inputs coming from a nearby aquifer raised the number of hydrophytes and the Cladium cover, and reduced the reed cover. Thus, decreases in water quantity and quality have acted together on wetlands over the last 35 years affecting plant species richness and cover. Wetland survival is endangered if no remedial actions, such as those we propose, are implemented.

N2  - Children residing in mining towns are potentially disproportionately exposed to metal(loid)s via ingestion and dust inhalation, thus, increasing their exposure when engaging in school or home gardening or playing outside. This citizen science study assessed preschool children’s potential arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) exposure via locally grown produce, water, incidental soil ingestion, and dust inhalation at four sites. Participants were trained to properly collect water, soil, and vegetable samples from their preschools in Nevada County, California. As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in irrigation sources did not exceed the U.S. EPA’s maximum contaminant and action levels. In general, garden and playground As and Pb soil concentrations exceeded the U.S. EPA Regional Screening Level, CalEPA Human Health Screening Level, and California Department of Toxic Substances Control Screening Level. In contrast, all Cd concentrations were below these recommended screening levels. Dust samples (<10 μm diameter) were generated from surface garden and playground soil collected at the preschools by a technique that simulated windblown dust. Soil and dust samples were then analyzed by in-vitro bioaccessibility assays using synthetic lung and gastric fluids to estimate the bioaccessible fraction of As, Cd, and Pb in the body. Metal(loid) exposure via grown produce revealed that lettuce, carrot, and cabbage grown in the preschool gardens accumulated a higher concentration of metal(loid) than those store-bought nation-wide. None of the vegetables exceeded the respective recommendation maximum levels for Cd and Pb set by the World Health Organization Codex Alimentarius Commission. The results of this study indicate that consumption of preschool-grown produce and incidental soil ingestion were major contributors to preschool-aged children’s exposure to As, Cd, and Pb. Traditionally, this level of site- and age-specific assessment and analyses does not occur at contaminated sites. The results of this holistic risk assessment can inform future risk assessment and public health interventions related to childhood metal(loid) exposures.

N2  - In recent years, decays by Alternaria spp. and Cladosporium spp. constituted a hazard to “Bosc” pear fruit during cold storage with significant economic losses (about 50%) in the Rio Negro and Neuquen Valleys. Studies with new fungicides that potentially have good activity against these key pathogens of “Bosc” pears were carried out. During the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, commercial formulations of pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pyr+Bosc), cyprodinil+fludioxonil (Cyp+Flu), fludioxonil (Flu), pyrimetanil (PyrM) and myclobutanil (Myc) were studied by in vitro and in vivo tests. Commercial formulations of Flu, PyrM and Myc were added to the study to be used and have a use register for pome fruits in Argentina. In vivo tests were applied postharvest on laboratory and semicommercial scale, and, preharvest, to orchard. In vitro tests showed high percentages of inhibition of mycelial growth and conidia germination of both Alternaria and Cladosporium, however Flu was highlighted in the inhibition of Alternaria (EC50=0.0014) and Pyr+Bosc to Cladosporium (EC50=1.14×10−8). In vivo assays on semi-commercial scale, showed that fungicides evaluated (Pyr+Bosc, Cyp+Flu, Flu and Pyr) applied postharvest only reduced the natural incidence of Alternaria-Cladosporium complex (4months at −1/0°C), between 24 and 35%, while on wounds artificially inoculated, the reduction achieved was between 91 and 98%. These results suggest that for the control of Alternaria-Cladosporium complex in Bosc pears, postharvest interventions are insufficient. In this sense, the results obtained of preharvest application of Pyr+Bosc showed that the control of the incidence of this decay after 4 months of cold storage was 44.6% of Alternaria-Cladosporium and 95% of B. cinerea. The results of this study indicate that preharvest applications, with the fungicide Pyr+Bosc, reduce the incidence of decay in postharvest, so this might be an important strategy to reduce postharvest losses in the irrigated valleys of Rio Negro y Neuquen.

N1  - Soil Processes under Pastures in Intertropical Areas
N2  - Sloping Vertisols having large exchangeable sodium contents are erodible. In Martinique, French West Indies, intensive market gardening during 15 years decreased their organic matter content, biological activity (roots, earthworms, mesofauna, microorganisms), soil porosity, and increased soil losses due to erosion. Conversely, old irrigated pastures (Digitaria decumbens, Pangola grass) on these soils maintained organic matter content, biological activity, soil porosity and aggregate stability. A research programme was set out in 1991 in the south-eastern part of Martinique in order to study the respective roles of grass roots and earthworms in the restoration of the properties of a degraded Vertisol. Plots with and without plants, with and without earthworms were tested and physical properties were followed during 4 years and compared with properties existing under market crops and old pastures. The restoration of physical properties was more rapid and more important in treatments with plants than in treatments without plants. Plants played a dominant role through rhizosphere effects and possible carbon rhizodeposition. The effect of earthworms was less important. Earthworms particularly increased the stability of aggregates of 200–500μm size, and decreased clay dispersion.

N1  - Hydrology Conference 2010
N2  - Summary
Hydrological knowledge or information has mostly remained in the domain of scientific community. The communities that interact with the hydrological aspects such as groundwater and surface water on a day to day basis are hardly aware of the information that could critically influence their livelihoods. From the perspective of the communities’ information pertaining to groundwater aquifer characters, potential to provide the water resource, surface groundwater interactions in varying geo-hydrological conditions are important. The ‘public good’ nature of the resources and their linkages with ecological systems gives rise to externalities that could be pervasive. In a number of countries, especially the developing countries, groundwater is the single largest source of drinking as well as irrigation water. In the absence of scientific information with the communities, extraction of groundwater resources for productive purposes has become a risky venture leading to adverse impacts on livelihoods. The externalities associated with over exploitation of groundwater resources and the resulting widespread well failure is identified as one of the main reasons for pushing farmers into debt trap and one of the reasons for farmer suicides in India. The negative externalities are increasingly becoming severe in the context of climate variability. This paper attempts to highlight the importance of hydrological information to the user communities from a socioeconomic perspective using a newly developed framework ‘REDUCE’ based on theories of effective communication. It shows, based on the evidence, how farming communities are getting affected in the absence of the basic hydrological information across socioeconomic groups. It is argued, using relevant information that the negative externalities could be mitigated to a large extent with proper dissemination of information among the communities and capacitating them to measure and use the information on their own. In order to make the hydrological information relevant and useful for the communities at the macro level, there are six key areas to be addressed viz., Resource (water), Estimation or Evaluation, Distribution, Users, Communication and Execution. Ground water extraction and use is associated with mostly negative externalities. Estimation methods and scale are not commensurate with the users’ needs. The natural distribution pattern of the groundwater accentuates the inequalities in its access and use. These inequalities could be corrected through proper policy interventions that pave the way for treating the resources as a common pool resource instead of allowing it to be exploited like a private resource. That is, the hydrological resources ought to be brought under the management regime with the help of policy and governance structures. Users neither have the wherewithal to obtain the right kind of information nor the ability to manage the resource judiciously without institutional support. In this context the communication part of the process of groundwater management becomes important. The external agencies like the NGOs, scientists and policy makers and implementers have to interact and provide the right kind of information packaged to suit the needs of the users. Innovative execution of policies through evolution of institutional mechanisms and user involvement is key to the success of groundwater management.

N2  - After a wildfire, the management of burnt wood may determine microclimatic conditions and microbiological activity with the potential to affect soil respiration. To experimentally analyze the effect on soil respiration, we manipulated a recently burned pine forest in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada National and Natural Park, SE Spain). Three representative treatments of post-fire burnt wood management were established at two elevations: (1) “salvage logging” (SL), where all trees were cut, trunks removed, and branches chipped; (2) “non-intervention” (NI), leaving all burnt trees standing; and (3) “cut plus lopping” (CL), a treatment where burnt trees were felled, with the main branches lopped off, but left in situ partially covering the ground surface. Seasonal measurements were carried out over the course of two years. In addition, we performed continuous diurnal campaigns and an irrigation experiment to ascertain the roles of soil temperature and moisture in determining CO2 fluxes across treatments. Soil CO2 fluxes were highest in CL (average of 3.34±0.19μmolm−2s−1) and the lowest in SL (2.21±0.11μmolm−2s−1). Across seasons, basal values were registered during summer (average of 1.46±0.04μmolm−2s−1), but increased during the humid seasons (up to 10.07±1.08μmolm−2s−1 in spring in CL). Seasonal and treatment patterns were consistent at the two elevations (1477 and 2317m a.s.l.), although respiration was half as high at the higher altitude. Respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture. Watering during the summer drought boosted CO2 effluxes (up to 37±6μmolm−2s−1 just after water addition), which then decreased to basal values as the soil dried. About 64% of CO2 emissions during the first 24h could be attributed to the degasification of soil pores, with the rest likely related to biological processes. The patterns of CO2 effluxes under experimental watering were similar to the seasonal tendencies, with the highest pulse in CL. Temperature, however, had a weak effect on soil respiration, with Q10 values of ca. 1 across seasons and soil moisture conditions. These results represent a first step towards illustrating the effects of post-fire burnt wood management on soil respiration, and eventually carbon sequestration.

N2  - The problem of concern in this project is that in the dry season following a lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop, yields of post-rice crops are generally low, despite adequate water commonly being available in the soil profile to grow a potentially high yielding dry season (DS) crop without irrigation. Maize (Zea mays L.) yields are as low as 1Mgha−1 or less, soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) at 0.3 to 0.8Mgha−1 in Indonesia and mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzek) around 0.5Mgha−1 in the Philippines. These are all very much below the yield potential of these soils. For example, mungbean yields of 2.2Mgha−1 have been achieved by IRRI in the Philippines on these soils without irrigation or additional fertilisers. The causes of low yields of DS crops after rice are mainly poor crop establishment and poor root growth due to soil physical constraints. These result from the breakdown of soil structure during wet cultivation (puddling) for rice. Yields are also limited by biological and chemical constraints. As a result of these low yields, farmers are reluctant to invest in post-rice crops. Therefore, land after lowland rice (at least 51millionha in Asia according to Huke [Huke, R.E., 1982. Rice Area by Type of Culture: South, Southeast, and East Asia. International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines, 32 pp.]) represents an underutilised resource that can be used to meet the food requirement of the ever increasing population of the developing world. To increase the utilisation of these soils, improved management practices are required to enable dry season crops to use the stored water in the soil profile after the rice crop. This paper outlines a project which was established with the general objective of developing soundly based soil management technologies that can overcome soil physical limitations to DS crop production after lowland rice. The specific objectives of the program were1.to test a range of soil management and agronomic practices that have the potential to overcome adverse soil physical conditions for DS crops after rice, across a range of soil and climates;2.to evaluate these practices by2.1.measuring the changes in soil physical conditions throughout the complete cropping cycle from rice to DS crops;2.2.determining the performance of the DS crop (establishment and growth) and its ability to extract soil water.3.to determine the mechanisms involved in dispersion due to puddling and in flocculation and structural development as the soil dries after draining surface water from rice fields. Relevant outcomes from this project are described in the following papers in this issue.

N2  - The global and regional variability and changes of climate and stream flows are likely to have significant influence on water resource availability. The magnitude and impacts of climate variability and change differs spatially and temporally. This study examines the long term hydroclimatic changes, analyses of the hydro-climate variability and detect whether there exist significant trend or not in the Gidabo catchment, rift valley lakes basin of Ethiopia. Precipitation, temperature and stream flow time series data were used in monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. The precipitation and temperature data span is between 1982 and 2014 and that of stream flow is between 1976 and 2006. To detect trends the analysis were done by using Mann Kendal (MK), Sen's graphical method and to detect change point using the Pettit test. The comparison of trend analysis between MK trend test and Sen graphical method results depict mostly similar pattern. The annual rainfall trends exhibited a significant decrease by about 12 mm per year in the upstream, which is largely driven by the significant decrease in the peak season rainfall. The Pettit test revealed that the years 1997 and 2007 were the change points. It is noted that the rise of temperature over a catchment might have decreased the availability of soil moisture which resulted in less runoff. The temperature analyses also revealed that the catchment was getting warmer; particularly in the upstream. The minimum temperature trend showed a significant increase about 0.08°c per annum. There is generally a decreasing trend in stream flow. The monthly stream flow also exhibited a decreasing trend in February, March and September. The decline in annual and seasonal rainfall and the increase in temperature lead to more evaporation and directly affecting the stream flow negatively. This trend compounded with the growth of population and increasing demand for irrigation water exacerbates the competing demand for water resources. It thus calls for prudence in devising appropriate intervention in the planning and sustainable development of the basin water resources.

N2  - Narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) is a grain legume well adapted to sandy soils of a Mediterranean climate and is the major grain legume in Australia. Improved herbicide tolerance of lupin cultivars is now considered as top priority by the industry for effective weed management. This paper reports induced mutation by seed mutagenesis in metribuzin-sensitive but anthracnose resistant cv. Tanjil, selection for metribuzin tolerant mutants in the field and evaluation of the tolerant mutants to metribuzin and anthracnose resistance. Two highly tolerant mutants Tanjil-AZ-33 and Tanjil-AZ-55 were identified and they were the first reported metribuzin tolerant mutants. The estimated mutation rate was 2.5×10−5. Tanjil-AZ-33 was six times and Tanjil-AZ-55 was four times more tolerant to metribuzin than the original cultivar Tanjil and they were also more tolerant than the tolerant cv. Mandelup. Tanjil-AZ-33 was the most tolerant lupin germplasm. Disease nursery assessment over 2 years revealed that both mutants also retained anthracnose resistance. Seed yield under irrigation was 4.2t/ha for Tanjil-AZ-33 and 1.9t/ha for cv. Tanjil when the seedlings were treated with metribuzin at 300g/ha at the six-leaf stage. Clearly the mutation process has created new tolerance to metribuzin, but did not alter the anthracnose resistance. The mutant Tanjil-AZ-33 has been used as a parent in the lupin breeding program as a source of both metribuzin tolerance and anthracnose resistance. Seed mutagenesis followed by field selection in M2 proved to be an effective method to develop new tolerance to herbicides.

N2  - Yield constraint analysis using a combination of experiments and crop growth models has been useful for quantifying the relative role of yield-limiting factors, and for prioritizing management interventions aimed at increasing the yields of non-photoperiod-sensitive rice grown under rainfed conditions. The use of a systems approach for photoperiod-sensitive varieties is constrained by the lack of crop growth models that can simulate the varieties’ photoperiod response. This study used data from the literature, from a controlled-growth experiment, and from multi-location field experiments to determine the photoperiod-sensitivity parameters of Jasmine rice grown in north-east Thailand, and incorporated these in the ORYZA2000 model. Next, the model was used to analyse yield gaps by comparing yields in farmers’ fields with the simulated attainable yields with an adequate N supply (60kgha−1) under irrigated conditions. The ORYZA2000 model adequately simulated growth, development, and yield of Jasmine rice over a 0–150kgNha−1 range under irrigated and normal to above-normal rainfall conditions. The simulated attainable yields ranged from 3.47 to 5.96Mgha−1. A simulated yield gap of 1.76Mgha−1 (41%) currently exists in rainfed rice farmers’ fields. Yield gaps could be substantially reduced by 1.48Mgha−1 (34%) through improved N-management practices. The yield gap caused by water limitation was small (0.02Mgha−1, <1%) during the study period, when rainfall was normal to above normal. The large yield gap beyond the farmers’ current fertilizer level suggests considerable scope for increasing yields through site- and time-specific nutrient management. A long-term simulation study including years with rainfall below normal is needed to comprehensively quantify yield gaps caused by water limitation. Such long-term simulation is hindered by the lack of long-term groundwater depth measurements.

N2  - In West Africa, the lowlands comprise a wide range of hydrological environments—from permanently flooded to permanently non-flooded conditions. Rice breeding programs must develop genotypes that are expected to perform well either across all hydrological environments or for a specific target population of environments. We evaluated 14 rice (Oryza spp.) genotypes in seven experiments during 2 years (2007 and 2008) in Benin to investigate genotype×environment (G×E) interaction for grain yield, and to identify high-yielding genotypes and plant characteristics associated with high yield. The genotypes consisted of O. sativa indica genotypes, including ‘aerobic rice genotypes’ and interspecific genotypes, developed from crossing O. sativa and O. glaberrima for upland (‘NERICA’ genotypes) and lowland conditions (‘NERICA-L’). The mean grain yield ranged from 231 to 588gm−2 across experiments, with the higher grain yields from flooded lowland conditions. The G×E interaction accounted for 22% of the total sum of squares, with environment and genotype responsible for 71 and 8%, respectively. Three environment groups were identified from a pattern analysis on grain yield. Grouping was related to water availability, distinguishing (i) an aerobic environment, with rice grown under aerobic conditions with supplemental irrigation, (ii) a hydromorphic environment, with rice grown under rainfed conditions with drought spells at the vegetative stage, and (iii) a permanently flooded environment. An interspecific genotype WAB1159-4-10-15-1-3 produced high yields in both flooded and hydromorphic environments, while two interspecific genotypes, NERICA-L-6 and NERICA-L-54 performed well only in a flooded environment. An aerobic rice genotype B 6144F-MR-6-0-0 outyielded these three interspecific genotypes in the aerobic environment. High grain yields in the flooded and hydromorphic environments resulted from biomass accumulation rather than harvest index, whereas the higher yield in the aerobic environment was the result of harvest index rather than biomass accumulation. Genotypes with high growth vigor at 42 and 63 days after sowing tended to have higher yields in the flooded and aerobic environments. Grain yield in the hydromorphic environment was positively correlated with growth duration. We conclude that while interspecific breeding appears to offer an effective approach to improving lowland rice productivity, a systematic effort is needed to screen a wide range of O. sativa and interspecific genotypes across hydrology gradients in West Africa to identify genotypes that perform well across or within a specific target population of environments.

N2  - A common dryland rotational cropping system in the semi-arid central Great Plains of the USA is wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (WCF). However, the 12-month fallow period following corn production has been shown to be relatively inefficient in storing precipitation during the summer months and in some years could leave the soil vulnerable to wind erosion. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect on system productivity when the fallow period in a WCF rotation was replaced with spring-planted forage triticale (X Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.). The 3-yr study was conducted at Akron, CO and Sidney, NE under both dryland and very limited irrigation conditions (to approximate average precipitation during the growing season). Growing season precipitation during the course of the study was above-average in five of the six site-years. Over a wide range of wheat water use (361–591mm) wheat yields ranged from 1696kgha−1 to 5527kgha−1. Wheat yields averaged 17% lower when triticale (T) replaced fallow, primarily because of reductions in water content at wheat planting. Corn yields were unaffected by triticale replacing fallow and ranged from 3159kgha−1 to 8085kgha−1. Triticale yields ranged from 2967kgha−1 to 6724kgha−1. System productivity as quantified by system net returns was greater for WCT than for WCF when growing season precipitation was above-average resulting in triticale production over 6000kgha−1, but even in drier years net income was not reduced when the fallow phase was replaced with triticale production. A WCT rotation can be recommended over WCF provided that growing season precipitation is not far below average and there is an available market for the triticale forage produced.

N2  - The adoption of conservation agriculture has gained considerable attention due to growing interest in managing soil biological diversity and overall soil health. However, there is limited understanding of how practices such as conservation tillage and residue retention affect soil biota across different spatial scales and are associated with alterations to other soil properties. In this study, we examined changes in soil physicochemical properties, soil macrofauna, and microbial communities at two soil depths (0–10 cm, and 10–20 cm) in a 6-year field experiment manipulating tillage and maize residue management. The following treatments were included in the experiment: no-till with residue retention; no-till with residue harvest; conventional tillage with residue retention; and conventional tillage with residue harvest. Macrofauna taxa were identified and estimated visually, while bacterial and fungal communities were identified and analyzed using high throughput sequencing and multivariate statistics including non-metric dimensional scaling and indicator species analysis. Soil physicochemical properties measured include soil carbon and nitrogen, soil moisture, permanganate oxidizable carbon, available soil phosphate, pH, electrical conductivity and aggregate stability. Residue retention increased macrofauna abundance and diversity across soil depths and tillage treatments. Fungal diversity was also highest under residue retention in the topsoil (0–10 cm), while bacterial diversity was generally higher under conventional tillage. Residue retention was the main driver of macrofauna and microbial community composition, while an interaction between tillage and residue management indicated that the effect of tillage on microbial communities was most pronounced when residues were retained. Soil carbon and nitrogen, aggregate stability, permanganate oxidizable carbon, soil moisture content, available soil phosphate and soil electrical conductivity were all enhanced under residue retention in the topsoil. Indicator species analysis suggested that macrofauna taxa belonging to Annelida, Aranaea and Chilopoda together with bacterial phyla Fibrobacteres and fungal phyla Rozellomycota were indicators for no-till combined with residue retention, while Coleoptera, Spirochaetae and Basidiomycota were indicators for conventional tillage with residue retention. Multivariate analyses suggested that total macrofauna abundance, soil carbon and pH were strongly associated with bacterial and fungal community composition in the topsoil layer. Co-inertia analysis indicated significant covariation between soil physicochemical, macrofauna, bacterial and fungal datasets, suggesting a strong association between different soil parameters and cascading effects of management on multiple soil properties. Our findings demonstrate that residue retention enhances soil biological, physical and chemical properties and that communities of soil macro- and microorganisms tend to respond in similar ways to these management interventions.

N2  - Modelling can be valuable in evaluating potential risks that heavy metals may pose to the environment, e.g. groundwater pollution, but there is no general agreement about the usefulness and limitations of different sorption approaches. Our objective was to test and compare different empirical and mechanistic models with respect to their suitability to describe and predict the transport of heavy metals in soils. Undisturbed columns of the acid subsoils of a sandy Podzol and a silty Cambisol were irrigated for two years with 4 mm day−1 at 8 °C with either relatively small (HM1, 0.1 to 1 mg L−1 corresponding to 0.9 to 19.2 μmol L−1) or markedly increased concentrations (HM2, 0.3 to 3 mg L−1 corresponding to 2.7 to 57.7 μmol L−1) of the heavy metals Pb, Cr(III), Cu, Ni and Cd. PHREEQC2 was used to calculate one-dimensional transport and homogenous and heterogenous reactions. The following models were tested: Sorption isotherms considering concentrations (Freundlich-1, Langmuir-1) or ion activities (Freundlich-2, Langmuir-2), cation exchange (CE) and competitive sorption (CSM)). Furthermore, two different calibration approaches were evaluated: a calibration procedure using the data of experiment HM2 followed by an independent validation (HM1) (approach A) was compared to a combined calibration using both data sets for parameter optimization (approach B). Parameters were optimized for all models using the parameter optimization program PEST. To evaluate the performance of the different models the modelling efficiency (EF) which provides a comparison of the efficiency of the respective model to the efficiency of describing the data as the mean of the measured data was used. Copper and Pb were retained in all columns to more than 99 %, whereas Cd and Ni reached concentrations up to 27 μmol L−1 (HM2) in solution. The modelling efficiency values for prediction (EFpredA) did not simply follow the order according to the number of adjustable parameters in the different models [CSM (3)>Freundlich, Langmuir (2)>CE (1)]. Model CSM predicted transport behaviour of Ni and Cd in the Podzol better than the best empirical model approach as reflected by higher EFpredA values (CSM: 0.85 (Ni) and 0.76 (Cd) vs. 0.60 (Ni; Freundlich-2) and 0.74 (Cd; Freundlich-2)). In the Cambisol, Cd transport dynamic was better predicted than Ni transport dynamic by all models tested. The best prediction was obtained by using Freundlich isotherms (EFpredA=0.72 and 0.73 for Freundlich-1 and Freundlich-2, respectively). As expected, independently of the model used, combined calibration of the HM1 and HM2 data generally improved the agreement between modelled and measured Ni and Cd concentrations (HM1) in both soils, where the prediction in approach A was only satisfactorily (EFpredA<0.60). Our results indicated that neither the application of mechanistic nor empirical models can be generally recommended for all soils. Thus, calibration experiments appear to be generally required for a subsequent accurate prediction of independent experiments. PEST was well-suited for the parameter optimization of all calibration models.

N2  - The performance of rapid sand filters was evaluated in three tertiary wastewater treatment plants in the State of Kuwait. These plants are located at Ardiya, Rikka and Jahra, and receive municipal wastewater flows of 220,000, 95,000 and 42,000 m3 d−1, respectively. The Ardiya plant uses a two-stage activated sludge process for the secondary treatment of wastewater whereas both the Rikka and Jahra plants use the extended aeration process. Daily records were obtained from each plant over a period of 1 year, and the efficiency of the tertiary sand filters was determined based on reductions in SS, VSS, BOD, and COD. Analysis of these records showed that the secondary-treated effluent quality is highly variable. Seasonal variations were observed due to nitrification and denitrification that enhance the production of nitrogen gas and carry over of sludge solids in the effluent during summer, causing more frequent backwashing of the filters. The data were also statistically analyzed using the ANOVA program. The results obtained indicated significant improvements, at 95% and 99% significance levels, in solids (SS, VSS) and organics (BOD, COD) removal by sand filtration. They also showed that, in addition to improving effluent quality, the tertiary filtration played an important role in the stability of effluent quality so as to dampen variations in the quality of secondary-treated effluent. The tertiary effluent consistently satisfied the water quality requirements for irrigation.

N2  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain yields vary considerably between seasons under subtropical irrigated conditions. Reports on comparisons of grain yield between early- and late-season rice in subtropical environments are lacking. In order to evaluate the role of climatic and physiological factors under double rice-cropping system in determining rice grain yield in farmers’ fields, six field experiments were conducted in both early and late seasons from 2008 to 2010 in Wuxue County, Hubei province, China. For early season crop, the attainable yield was highest under dense planting (38.5hillsm−2) when N was applied at a rate of 120–180kgha−1. However, the effect of hill density on grain yield was relatively smaller for late season crop, while moderate hill density (28.1hillsm−2) and nitrogen rate (120kgha−1) were advantageous in terms of grain yield and lodging resistance. Remarkably higher grain yields were achieved in late season crops compared with early season crops, as the former had superiority over the latter in sink size (sink capacity, such as spikelets per m2) and biomass production. The comparatively lower yield under early season mainly resulted from slower growth during the vegetative phase, which can be attributed to the lower temperature rather than reduced mean daily radiation. Summary statistics suggested that there was ample opportunity to improve rice yield in early season crops, compared with late season crops. Correlation analysis further showed that spikelets per m2, panicles per m2, leaf area index at panicle initiation and flowering, biomass at physiological maturity and biomass accumulation after flowering should be emphasized for increasing grain yield, especially in early season crops under the double rice-cropping system in central China. Current breeding programs need to target strong tillering ability, large panicle size and greater grain filling (%) for early season crops, and high yield potential and lodging-resistance for late season crops as primary objectives.

N2  - Groundwater in Spain, as in other arid and semiarid countries worldwide, has been widely used in the expansion of irrigated agriculture. In the Spanish Mancha Occidental aquifer, the excessive, and sometimes illegal, water abstraction for irrigation has promoted outstanding socioeconomic development in the area, but it has also resulted in exploitation of the aquifer and degradation of valuable wetlands. Water policies implemented in the region have not yet managed to restore the aquifer and face strong social opposition. This paper uses a multi-scale modeling approach to explore the environmental and socio-economic impacts of alternative water conservation measures at the farm and basin levels. It also analyzes their comparative cost-effectiveness to help policy makers identify the least costly policy option for achieving the goal of the Mancha Occidental aquifer's sustainability. To conduct this analysis, a Mathematical Programming Model has been developed to simulate: the closing-up and taxed-legalization of unlicensed wells, uniform volumetric and block-rate water prices, water quotas, and water markets. Aggregate results show that net social costs are not substantially different across policy option, so none of the considered policy options will be clearly more cost-effective than the others. However, there are significant differences between private and public costs (at the farm and sub-basin levels), which will be critical for determining the application in practice of these policies. Results show that controlling illegal water mining (through the legalization of unlicensed wells) is necessary, but is not sufficient to recover the aquifer. Rather, effective water management in this area will require the implementation of other water management policies as well. Among them, uniform volumetric and block-rate water pricing policies will entail the lowest net social cost, but will produce important income losses in the smallest and most water-intensive farms, which might put at risk the viability of these farms and the social acceptance of the policies. Further investigations on social costs, policy enforcement capacity and public participation in water management are highly recommended.

N1  - Monitoring of Changes Related to Natural and Manmade Hazards Using Space Technology
N2  - Depletion in the forest area threatens the sustainability of agricultural production systems and en-dangers the economy of the country. Every year extensive areas of arable agricultural and forestlands are degraded and turned into wastelands over time, due to natural causes or human interventions. Depletion in forest cover, therefore, has an important impact on socio-economic development and ecological balance. High population growth rate in Pakistan is one of the main causes for rapid deterioration of the physical environment and natural resource base. In view of this, it was felt necessary to carryout landuse studies focusing on mapping the past and present conditions and the extent of forests and rangelands using satellite remote sensing (SRS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies. The SRS and GIS technologies provide a possible means of monitoring and mapping the changes occurring in natural resources and the environment on a continuous basis. The riverine forests of Sindh mostly growing along the river Indus in the flood plains are spread over an area of 241,000 ha but are disappearing very rapidly. Construction of dams/barrages on the upper reaches of the river Indus for hydroelectric power and irrigation works have significantly reduced the discharge of fresh water into the lower Indus basin and as a result 100,000 acres of forests have disappeared. Furthermore, heavy floods that occurred in 1978, 1988, 1992 and 1997, altered the course of the River Indus in many places, especially in the lower reaches, this has also damaged the riverine forests of Sindh. An integrated approach involving analysis of SRS data from 1977 to 1998 and GIS technique have been used to evaluate the geographic extent and distribution of the riverine forests of Sindh and to monitor temporal changes in the forest cover between 1977 and 1990; 1990 and 1998; and 1977 and 1998. The integrated landuse forest cover maps have shown not only the temporal changes that occur in the riverine forest but also in the river Indus course between 22 years period.

N2  - Tolerance to drought-stress (DS) of the citrus rootstock Forner–Alcaide no. 5 (FA-5) was tested and compared with that of its parents, Cleopatra mandarin (CM) and Poncirus trifoliata (PT). Nine-month-old seedlings of CM, PT and FA-5 and 15-month-old grafted trees of ‘Valencia’ orange scions on these three rootstocks were cultivated in sand under glasshouse conditions and irrigated with a nutrient solution. Plants were drought-stressed by withholding irrigation until leaves were fully wilted. Survival time of both seedlings and grafted trees under DS was linked to the water extraction rate from the soil, which depended mainly on leaf biomass and on transpiration rate. Seedling responses to DS affecting leaf water relationships and gas exchange parameters varied among genotypes. FA-5 seedlings survived longer than the other seedlings, maintaining the highest levels of water potential, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and net CO2 assimilation towards the end of the experiment, when water stress was most severe. Thus, FA-5 was more resistant to DS than its parents (CM and PT). Moreover, rootstock affected the performance of grafted trees under water stress conditions. The higher drought tolerance induced by FA-5 rootstock could be related to the greater osmotic adjustment (OA), which was reflected by smaller reductions in leaf relative water content (RWC) and in higher turgor potentials and leaf gas exchange than the other rootstocks.

N2  - Today, food security has a critical place in the government agendas of developing countries. In Latin American case, urban contexts have been subject to radical transformations in the last decades, most apparently through the expansion of social housing, which may limit or condition access to food for the neediest population. Nowadays, in Latin America, there are numerous cases of urban agriculture. Quito (Ecuador) stands out for the development of urban agriculture through the Participatory Urban Agriculture Project - AGRUPAR; initiative that has led to the implementation of orchards with organic production, raising of small animals, food processing and marketing of surpluses for food-nutrition security. Above all, it has transcended its urban and peri-urban intervention to rural areas, favoring the urban-rural connection. Also, worldwide the urban agriculture is developed in different forms, one of which is through crops protected by a greenhouse on the roofs: Rooftop greenhouse (RTG). This form of UA uses specific substrates for hydroponic crops and has modern irrigation systems often combined with rainwater harvesting and provides a unique opportunity to improve urban agriculture in Quito. The purpose of this study is to identify the implementation potential of rooftop greenhouses in social neighborhoods in Quito. Standard methods to assess the potential use of rooftop greenhouses were adapted to a social neighborhood. The guidelines follow three steps: Step 1: Characterization based on criteria; Step 2: Available surface determination and Step 3: Production, self-sufficiency and self-supply. “La Comuna Santa Clara de San Millán” was selected as study area. The results showed that 33.2% (7.70 ha) of the neighborhood rooftops had a short-term feasibility to install rooftop greenhouses, with the potential to produce 1,579,140 and 56,720 kg/year of tomato and lettuce respectively. The research has developed reliable guidelines that prove the feasibility to install rooftop greenhouses in similar large Latin-American cities area.

N2  - ABSTRACT
The cerrado is a Neotropical savanna characterized by a soil and vegetation mosaic where plants endure dystrophic soils and seasonal drought. Dry spells or flooding are the main environmental stress native species face in their growth period. African grasses are common invasive species, jeopardizing the biodiversity by displacing native species and outgrowing them. Invasive species may benefit from human interventions that increase nutrient availability in natural areas and may respond differently than natives to environmental conditions. Therefore, we compared the performance of one native (Schizachyrium microstachyum) and one invasive (Melinis minutiflora) grass in different conditions of water and nutrient availability simulating possible cerrado scenarios. Five-week-old seedlings were submitted to different irrigation treatments (simulating dry spells, normal rainfall, and flooding) and fertilization treatments (high or low nutrient availability) for four weeks, and were analyzed for morphological (leaf area, length of the shoot, number of tillers, seedling dry weight, and root:shoot ratio) and physiological parameters (chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment concentration, nutrient content, and biochemical assays). There was a trend for the invasive species to show better responses to water stress by growing more profusely, showing an even higher effect when the soil was richer in nutrients. The invasive species may outcompete the native species by using nutrients and water more efficiently, showing a weaker oxidative response to drought and fertilization. The native species would perform at a similar pace to the invasive species in conditions of less water and nutrient availability, whereas unnatural fertilization inputs and high-water availability would benefit the invasive species.

N2  - Irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield increases in Asia have slowed down in recent years. Further, yield increases are likely to occur in smaller increments through fine-tuning of crop management. On-farm experiments at 179 sites in eight key irrigated rice domains of Asia were conducted from 1997 to 1999 to evaluate a new approach for site-specific nutrient management (SSNM). Large variation in initial soil fertility characteristics and indigenous supply of N, P, and K was observed among the eight intensive rice domains as well as among farms within each domain. Field- and season-specific NPK applications were calculated by accounting for the indigenous nutrient supply, yield targets, and nutrient demand as a function of the interactions between N, P, and K. Nitrogen applications were fine-tuned based on season-specific rules and field-specific monitoring of crop N status. The performance of SSNM was tested for four successive rice crops. Average grain yield in the SSNM increased by 0.36Mgha−1 (7%) compared to the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons or 0.54Mgha−1 (11%) compared to the baseline FFP yield before intervention. Average nutrient uptake under SSNM increased by about 10% in the same seasons or by 13% (N) and 21% (P, K) compared to the baseline data. Yield increases were associated with a 4% decrease in the average N rate, but larger amounts of fertilizer-K at sites where the previous K use was low. Average N use efficiencies increased by 30–40%, mainly through the use of improved in-season N management schemes. Across all sites and four successive rice crops, profitability increased by US$ 46ha−1 per crop or 12% of the total average net return. The performance of SSNM did not differ significantly between high-yielding and low-yielding climatic seasons, but improved over time with larger benefits observed in the second year. Average profitability increased from US$ 32ha−1 pre crop in the first year to US$ 61ha−1 pre crop in the second year due to improvements in the SSNM approach and re-capitalization of P and K applied in the first year. SSNM required little extra credit for financing, and remained profitable even if rice prices are somewhat lower than current levels. Further, scope for improvement exists at many sites by alleviating other crop management constraints to nutrient use efficiency. Profit increases ranged from US$ 4 to 82ha−1 per crop among eight rice domains. However, profit decreases occurred in about 25% of all cases, indicating that a certain minimum level of crop care is required for SSNM to be profitable. Yields at sites with labor-saving direct-seeding of larger fields were about 1Mgha−1 lower than those achieved at sites with labor-intensive transplanting and good management, raising concern about future trends in rice production. SSNM has potential for improving yields and nutrient efficiency in irrigated rice to close existing yield gaps. The major challenge for SSNM will be to retain the success of the approach while reducing the complexity of the technology as it is disseminated to farmers. The nature of the approach will need to be tailored to specific circumstances in different countries. In some areas, SSNM may be field or farm specific, but in many areas it is likely to be just region and season-specific.

N2  - Pakistani farmers are using groundwater at an increasing rate to supplement their irrigation needs. This practice has led to overexploitation of groundwater in the country, resulting in many negative externalities and increased resource costs. In response to the growing water shortage, the informal groundwater markets in the arid and semi-arid regions of Punjab have gradually emerged. These markets are believed to improve the fair distribution of groundwater and encourage more efficient use of agricultural water. This study aims to investigate these claims through conducting a field survey of 120 farmers that are further divided into three groups i.e. buyers, self-users cum sellers, and self-users (control group). Further, the study employed a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to estimate the water use efficiency of all three type of groundwater actors. The study findings show that water buyers are mostly small farmers who do not own tube wells, hence buy water from tube well owners (large farmers). The study also found that groundwater markets improve the equity of water access to some extent, as water is transferred from large farmers to small farmers. The results of DEA analysis show water buyers and water sellers are more efficient in using water than the control group, making buyers the most efficient of all groups. Therefore, participation in water markets appears to be improving the WUE of farmers. The results of single bootstrapped truncated regression show that participation in water markets and access to extension services can improve WUE, while off-farm income and the diesel tube wells can reduce WUE in the study area. However, government could play an important role here through introducing groundwater regulations and improving water use efficiency for sustainable and equitable distribution of water among water users.

N2  - The association of specific target traits for drought resistance (early flowering, high accumulation of stem water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) reserves, presence of awns and high green flag-leaf area persistence) with yield performance under late-season drought was analyzed utilizing two doubled-haploid (DH) populations derived from crosses between Beaver×Soissons and Rialto×Spark in two seasons 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. The aim was to quantify associations between target traits and yield responses to drought, and to prioritize traits for drought resistance. Flowering time variation had a neutral effect on the absolute yield loss under drought, suggesting there may be a trade-off between water-saving behaviour in the shorter pre-flowering period with early flowering and a reduced capacity to access water associated with a smaller rooting system. The presence of awns also had a neutral effect on yield loss under drought amongst lines of the Beaver×Soissons population. The potential advantages of awns for increasing water-use efficiency and sensible heat transfer responsible for a cooler canopy appeared to be of less significance under moderate droughts in the UK than under severe droughts in other regions worldwide. The value of large stem soluble carbohydrate reserves for drought environments alone could not be confirmed in the UK environment. Stem WSC was positively associated with grain yield under both irrigation and drought. The genetic trait which showed the clearest correlation with the ability to maintain yield under drought was green flag-leaf area persistence. Averaged across years, the positive phenotypic correlation of this trait with yield under drought amongst DH lines of the Beaver×Soissons population (r=0.49; p≤0.001) indicated the potential use of this trait as a selection criterion for yield under drought. It is suggested that screens for this trait including marker-assisted selection would have value in future breeding programmes aimed at improving yields in high yielding, rainfed environments, but where drought can also be a problem, such as the UK.

N2  - This paper is about sustainability in water management from a business perspective. The idea of sustainability has evolved over the centuries. It emerged after the era of super abundance, through the needs of humans in community, to the protection of the commons, and the wider environment. Regulation by government is a relative latecomer, in response to third party scrutiny of resource mismanagement. However, the idea of sustainability has also been embraced, and put into practical effect, through the passion and vision of some business leaders. Richard Pratt has built an entire global business on the foundation of sustainability—through recycling and closed-loop principles. Richard Pratt's vision for sustainability in Australia's water management has spawned Pratt Water, which is shortly to report on an intensive study into business investments to save and sustain water resources in the Murrumbidgee Valley in NSW, Australia.The Murrumbidgee River carries 4400 gigalitres (GL) of water each year for 1700 km between Canberra and Balranald. About half this is diverted for irrigated agricultural production purposes. The Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency Feasibility Project seeks to answer key water efficiency questions that will drive new investment, save water and enhance the prospects for regional communities. The current Murrumbidgee Valley's water supply businesses revealed that they cannot support the new investments required to allow them to operate at best practice in terms of water efficiency. The water business balance sheet shows that water is being lost from the River Valley system, and no-one confidently knows where it is going, or at what opportunity cost it is being lost.Pratt Water has found that, Valley-wide, about 70 GL are lost to evaporation from the open water, and a further 170 GL, or around 8% of allocations, are lost on or near farms each year. Much larger volumes (over 500 GL/year) are simply unaccounted for. Problems with measurement and monitoring of river and offtake flows contribute to water supply uncertainty. Measurement variances of up to 33% mean that no-one can confidently ‘sign off’ on the water business accounts.Pratt Water undertook a detailed economic ranking to establish the costs and benefits of fixing the leaks or otherwise capturing the system's water losses and putting them to new productive use. Using the saved water on higher values crops, and/or including saving costs as part of the overall water supply charges are two ways of achieving better water use for the entire community's benefit.The Pratt Water Murrumbidgee project identified additional or new market-based production opportunities within the valley to both generate water savings through best practice (compared to existing activities) and to utilize water saved through other interventions. On this analysis, valley-wide farm gate income could rise by over $100 m/year, which represents about a 20% increase on current economic output. Pratt Water also identified and trialled ways of dramatically lowering the cost of irrigation water delivery, while at the same time improving water use efficiency. This included a new woven, plastic-coated flume pipe which cost 72% less than conventional delivery infrastructure and saved 30–40% of the irrigation water.Better management of high summer river flows was also addressed. Solutions included above-ground and below-ground water storages. An aquifer storage and recovery scheme was identified which could provide additional water for as little as $62/ML, whilst providing a means of managing the excessive drawdown in the lower valley's groundwater profile. The team also characterized the ecological assets of the valley and identified ways of supplying the right water at the right time and in an economically feasible way to sustain those environmental resources.As the present drought has starkly underlined, water delivery choices, in terms of quality, quantity and timing, are also becoming critical issues for the entire community. While demand for water grows in a supply-constrained system, water users are demanding cost competitiveness in the supply and delivery of that water in the face of increased market competition for the goods they are producing. Pratt Water is showing the needed leadership for the private sector to provide business-led solutions to tackle this crucial water sustainability challenge.

N1  - Agriculture and Climate Change - Adapting Crops to Increased Uncertainty (AGRI 2015)
N2  - Rainfed agriculture with nearly 58% of the cultivated area is home to about 40% of human and 60% of livestock population in India and contributes 40% of the country's food production. Even after full realizing the full irrigation potential of the country, half of the cultivated area will continue to be under rainfed farming which highly dependent on monsoon rainfall. It is widely believed that increasing rainfall variability is likely to affect the livelihoods of millions of small and marginal farmers in the years to come. The National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) was initiated in 2011 to primarily strengthen research to address climate change and to demonstrate proven resilient practices in most climate vulnerable parts of the country. Farmer participatory technology demonstrations are being carried out since 2011-12 in 100 vulnerable districts prone to recurrent drought, floods, and extreme weather events like cyclone, heat and cold wave. Interventions broadly fall into four modules related to natural resource management (NRM), crop, livestock and fisheries production systems and capacity building. During these three years, rainfall variability such as delayed onset and prolonged breaks in monsoon was experienced in several parts of the country. A total of 1259 NRM interventions to impact resilience through in situ soil moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting and efficient recycling were demonstrated, which resulted in a significant increase in crop yields by about 20-40% even under variable rainfall situations. Short duration, drought and flood tolerant varieties in paddy, pulses and oilseeds crops were demonstrated in about 2700ha covering 7831 farmers with adaptation gains ranging from 10 to 31% [1,2]. Some of the climate resilient practices and technologies which have been found promising are being mainstreamed into the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), a flagship government initiative for enhancing productivity and resilience of Indian agriculture in accordance with the stated aim of the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC).

N2  - Perchlorate ion (ClO4−) has been identified in samples of dormant salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) growing in the Las Vegas Wash. Perchlorate is an oxidant, but its reduction is kinetically hindered. Concern over thyroid effects caused the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to add perchlorate to the drinking water Contaminant Candidate List (CCL). Beginning in 2001, utilities will look for perchlorate under the Unregulated Contaminants Monitoring Rule (UCMR). In wood samples acquired from the same plant growing in a contaminated stream, perchlorate concentrations were found as follows: 5–6 μg g–1 in dry twigs extending above the water and 300 μg g–1 in stalks immersed in the stream. Perchlorate was leached from samples of wood, and the resulting solutions were analyzed by ion chromatography after clean-up. The identification was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry after complexation of perchlorate with decyltrimethylammonium cation. Because salt cedar is regarded as an invasive species, there are large scale programs aimed at eliminating it. However, this work suggests that salt cedar might play a role in the ecological distribution of perchlorate as an environmental contaminant. Consequently, a thorough investigation of the fate and transport of perchlorate in tamarisks is required to assess the effects that eradication might have on perchlorate-tainted riparian ecosystems, such as the Las Vegas Wash. This is especially important since water from the wash enters Lake Mead and the Colorado River and has the potential to affect the potable water source of tens of millions of people as well as irrigation water used on a variety of crops, including much of the lettuce produced in the USA.

N2  - The sites of limitations on photosynthesis in rice are reviewed for the purpose of developing a strategy to bring about an increase in yield. On the basis of measurements made on irrigated rice under tropical conditions, the sites of real and potential photosynthetic losses are identified. It was found that rice was not optimally adapted for photosynthesis under high irradiance, with light saturation of upper leaves and midmorning depressions of photosynthetic capacity. The limitation of photosynthetic capacity may occur because of the combined effects of developmental programming and incomplete acclimation to high irradiance. Some rice varieties appear to have Rubisco levels well in excess of those required to support measured photosynthetic rates, suggesting its role as a store of leaf N. The important interaction between photosynthetic capacity and the mobilization of Rubisco as a source of leaf N for grain development is discussed. These findings are considered in the context of the introduction of C4 photosynthesis into rice. In this regard, the implications of the increased ATP/NADPH requirement of C4 photosynthesis are also assessed in terms of electron transport.

N2  - One of the main challenges for organic vineyards is weed management. Weeds tend to compete for water and nutrients, and can cause large yield reductions. Traditional under-vine weed management in organic vineyards consists on mechanical cultivation along the season, which is associated to soil and young vine root damages, and to high fuel consumption. Thus, sustainable alternatives need to be found. Cover crops are becoming common in the last decades due to their multiple benefits in agroecosystems. Nevertheless, under-vine cover crop implementation in Mediterranean vineyards is limited as this competes for resources (water and nutrients), reducing the yield, vegetative development, and grape size of vines. The use of organic mulches could overcome all these problems, while benefitting vine performance. In the present work, the response of vines, soil and weeds to mulching was evaluated. An experiment was carried out in Raimat, Lleida (Catalonia, NE Spain) in a commercial vineyard from 2019 to 2021, and the following treatments applied: 1) mechanical cultivation with an in-row tiller; 2) mowing a permanent spontaneous cover with an in-row mower; 3) almond shell mulch; and 4) chopped pine wood mulch. Results showed lower weed cover along the three seasons in mulched treatments, as well as higher yield, better vine water status, and greater vegetative development from traditional measurement. The latter was confirmed by and analised with further detail with measurements acquired with a mobile terrestrial laser scanner (MTLS) based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. Besides, petiole nutrient status was better in vines without a spontaneous living cover. Organic mulches improved vine performance and weed control, so these results allow to optimize water use efficiency in the Mediterranean basin with scarce water resources. Mulching can be considered as a useful strategy that enhances a more sustainable viticulture.

N2  - Publisher Summary Emitter clogging continues to be a major problem in micro-irrigation systems. For high-valued annual crops and for perennial crops, where the longevity of the system is especially important, emitter clogging can cause large economic losses. Even though information is available on the factors causing clogging, controlled measures are not always successful. Problems can be minimized by appropriate design, installation, and operational practices. Reclamation procedures to correct clogging increase maintenance costs, and unfortunately, may not be permanent. Reliable operation of micro-irrigation systems depends upon preventive maintenance. A preventive maintenance program should include water filtration, field inspection, pipeline flushing, and chemical water treatment. A suitable combination of type, size, and capacity filter unit is required. Appropriate procedures should be followed for the field inspection and flushing of micro-irrigation systems. Chemical water treatment should be properly selected for maintaining emitter performance. Because water quality is of primary importance in the design and operation of the system, adequate water analysis should be made and evaluated on the basis of past experience, such as the water classification scheme presented to evaluate the clogging potential of the micro-irrigation water source.

N2  - Clean water is an important resource for maintaining human life, economic activities, and ecosystems' survival. Nevertheless, its irregular distribution and occasional scarcity lead to the need to promote its sustainable use. To assess the current situation and the dynamics of sustainable water use, it is crucial to identify the main factors affecting it and to propose monitoring indicators. This paper develops an approach based on compromise programming to analyse water use sustainability at the municipal level, with a methodology that comprise a framework designed in five steps: 1 – indicators' choice; 2 – indicators's weights; 3 – definition of sustainability rankings with the application of a compromise programming approach; 4- application of a GIS analysis; 5 – identification of the main factors affecting sustainable water use. As a first result, the consensus weights of the chosen indicators were defined, indicating that the most important internal factors affecting sustainable water use are safe water, the percentage of housing served by water supply and water distributed by inhabitant. Then sustainability rankings at the municipality level were defined considering these factors. Finally, it was possible to conclude that tourism activity, income level, and young age population have a significant negative effect on sustainable water use, and municipal revenue has a positive effect. Irrigated farming shows a non-significant negative effect on sustainable water use. Population density, elderly population and education level did not show the expected effects on sustainable water use.

N2  - Standard hydroeconomic policy models are usually applied to areas in the world where precipitation is very low and crops are fully irrigated. As such, these models pool the annual stored precipitation plus other water supplies and assume that this total water supply can be allocated by time and place. This water pooling approach treats precipitation and irrigation water as fully substitutable. In many irrigated areas, however, a significant amount of water used by crops comes from precipitation. In fact the majority of the global irrigation systems are supplemental to rainfall and, in this context, precipitation and water stored in reservoirs are not fully substitutable. By using primary data from a watershed in Brazil, where precipitation and supplemental water use occur, this paper shows that standard models under-estimate the predicted drought impacts. The paper investigates this issue by setting up two model specifications of regional net-revenue maximization based on a calibrated economic programming model integrated with a mass balance hydrologic model. In one model the substitution between precipitation and irrigation water is explicitly formalized and in the other precipitation and irrigation water are aggregated together in a single water supply. The models are used to estimate and predict the short-run impacts of precipitation cuts on irrigation reservoir levels and the impacts of lower irrigation water supply on farmers' agricultural income. In comparing the results, we find that the standard aggregated hydroeconomic model under-estimates losses in expected returns to farmers and also results in less variability of returns under stochastic rainfall.

N2  - CONTEXT: Village Tank Cascade Systems (VTCSs), which are ancient
irrigation systems in Sri Lanka have un-dergone various pressures over
time including climate variability, population growth, land use changes
and agricultural intensification. VTCSs have provided irrigation and
vital ecosystem services for generations, while facing these pressures.
As external pressures have increased drastically over the last century,
it is worthwhile to investigate VTCS's current capacity to tolerate
pressures exerted on them while sustaining their functions.OBJECTIVE:
The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the pressures exerted on
Mahakanumulla VTCS due to climate change, population growth, land use
changes and agricultural practices, (ii) evaluate the impacts of the
pressures on the system in terms of water quality and quantity.METHODS:
Rainfall data from 1906 to 2020 were analyzed to identify the rainfall
trends over the last century. Land use maps were developed for 1910,
1979, 2002 and 2018. To identify current farming practices, a
ques-tionnaire survey was carried out targeting 357 respondents followed
by field investigations. Environmental impacts due to pressures on the
system were evaluated using water quantity estimations and quality
tests.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Paddy extent has increased from 6.3% to
20.2% while the homestead extent has increased from 1.6% to 11.5%
during the last century. The lands used for sustainable shifting
cultivation have encroached with permanent agricultural lands and human
settlements. The runoff coefficient rose from 0.29 to 0.45, indicating a
high outflow of water during rains and limiting water retention within
the system. This is an indication of increasing water scarcity in dry
periods due to limited recharge capacity. Although the system continues
to function without significant water quality deterioration,
agricultural activities can cause threats in the future. Hence, the
system needs immediate attention in the context of proper land use
planning, farmer awareness and integrated nutrient management at the
cascade level to minimize these pressures exerted upon the
system.SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying and quantifying various pressures
exerted on VTCSs is the fundamental step in setting management and
mitigation plans. Project planners and policymakers need evidence-based
information in this regard. Therefore, this study's findings and the
research framework that may be extended to other VTCSs and similar
systems are significant in creating a favorable policy environment and
implementation programmes to reduce the risks the VTCSs are exposed to.

N2  - Provision of landscape amenities produced by farmers, in addition to their economic function of producing food and fibre, has contributed to a reassessment of the role of agriculture in society. In this paper, we examine whether agricultural landscape provision really responds to a social demand as is argued by those in favour of multifunctionality. Thus, the aim of the present work is two-fold. First, we evaluate rural landscape preferences of citizens from a range of choices in the mountain area of the Alpujarras (south-eastern Spain), and second, we estimate their willingness to pay (WTP) to enjoy each of the landscape characteristics existing in the area. For the empirical analysis, based on a survey of public preferences due to the good public characteristics of landscape amenities, we applied two stated preference methods: Conjoint Analysis (CA) and Contingent Valuation (CV). Three landscape attributes were considered for this analysis: type of vegetation layer, density of rural buildings, and level of slope. Several levels were also considered for each attribute: abandoned fields, dryland farming, irrigated farming, and natural lands were included for the vegetation layer; three levels (low, intermediate and intense) were considered for the level of slope and three levels (none, little and intense) for rural buildings. The empirical findings from the CA and CV confirm that the agricultural-landscape component (first irrigated lands, followed by dryland farming, within the attribute “vegetation layer”), plays an important role in public preferences on the landscape and WTP. Maintaining local agricultural activities, preventing future migration from agricultural lands, recovering abandoned fields, and including elements of rural landscape observation and appreciation of existing recreational programmes for rural tourism in the area, were among the strategies to take full advantage of this aesthetic landscape potential, and to foster sustainable development of the region.

N2  - Independently controlled irrigation plots were designed to test two container nursery irrigation regimes on oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia ‘Alice’) in both nursery and controlled greenhouse environments. The experiments were conducted in both 3.8 and 11.4L containers. Plants were automatically irrigated by one of two soil moisture sensor-based regimes: (1) a daily water use (DWU) system that delivered the exact amount of water that had been lost in the previous 24h and (2) an on-demand (OD) irrigation system based on a specific substrate moisture content derived from the relationship between substrate moisture and photosynthetic rate. In this system, irrigation was applied when the substrate moisture level fell below 33% container capacity, which corresponded to 90% maximum predicted photosynthetic rate. Both treatments delivered the volume of water required to return the containers to container capacity by overhead irrigation, but the DWU system was static, irrigating once per day, whereas OD was dynamic and irrigated whenever the substrate moisture reached the 33% threshold level. Gas exchange was measured at the driest point prior to the next irrigation event. Periodical growth index, water use, and final dry weight were recorded. OD used less water than DWU outdoors, reduced leaching fraction among greenhouse experiments, and had either no or a positive impact on biomass in all but one trial. For 3.8L plants, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were consistently greater when irrigated by the OD program. Both treatments used significantly less water than the industry standard of 2.5cm per day. This research demonstrated that both DWU and OD are a dramatic improvement over conventional irrigation scheduling and could be adopted as conservative irrigation systems for nursery production.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture is the primary sector demanding water resources in the world. Given that, improved irrigation technologies could play a crucial role in enhancing water use efficiency. This paper uses causal inference estimators to evaluate the effect of these technologies on irrigators at the farm level in two irrigated valleys in Central Chile. Doubly robust estimators were employed to address the selection bias of the adoption of improved irrigation technologies. The results show first a low level of technology adoption, with only 18% of irrigators adopting irrigation, where access to credits and education plays a crucial role in their adoption. Despite this low rate, the estimates show consistently positive and significant impacts on adopters in terms of annual margins and land use. As a result, our research calls for attention towards focusing programs and policy targeting on reducing entry barriers and broadening the adoption of irrigation technologies, allowing to reduce the gap in terms of economic wellbeing and the long-term sustainability and adaptation to climate change of irrigated areas.

N2  - The primary purpose was to investigate the effect of the Environment Friendly Agricultural Land Protection (EFALP) program initiated in 2006. More specifically, the study objectives were to determine the adoption levels of environmentally friendly practices, the extension activities being performed in the region, and to analyse the factors influencing the adoption of the program. Respondents were selected by drawing two stratified samples based on farm size. Cross tabulation and chi-square tests of independence were used to achieve the first objective of the study. Focus-group interviews were conducted for the second objective, and finally, a binary logistic-regression model was applied for the third objective. The findings showed that the adopter farmers used land protection measures extensively relative to the non-adopters, and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock of Turkey, provides useful extension services in the region. Farm size, irrigated land, income level, specialization area, cooperative membership, and travel frequency to large cities influence the adoption of the EFALP program. The conclusion is that the promoted program significantly influenced the protection of the land and other natural resources, and therefore, the regions implementing programs of this type must be extended to other environmentally sensitive areas of the country.

N2  - Ascorbic acid (AsA) is considered as one of the most important and profusely known occurring water soluble antioxidants in plants, however, it is not well known to what extent this antioxidant might contribute in alleviating the adverse effects of water deficit on plant growth, yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). In attempt to clarify whether exogenous application of AsA could alleviate the adverse effects of water deficit on sunflower plants, two seasons (2014 and 2015) of field experimentation were conducted using six combinations of two AsA levels (AsA(–) and AsA(+), i.e. zero and 450 ppm AsA, respectively) and three irrigation water amounts (I100, I85, and I70, i.e. 100, 85 and 70% of crop evapotranspiration, respectively). Under water shortage, leaf chlorophyll content increased but proline content lowered in AsA–treated plants compared to the untreated ones. Lower values of LAI, head weight, seed yield ha–1, and oil yield ha–1 were recorded with decreasing water supply, while the highest values were gained when supplying plants with sufficient water (I100) plus application of AsA (i.e. AsA(+)), i.e., I100AsA(+). Plants under the latter treatment grew well and possessed higher yields compared to that of suffering from deficit water without AsA application, i.e. I85AsA(–) or I70AsA(–). Head weight and seed as well as oil yields ha–1 produced in 2014 season under sufficient water supply without AsA application (I100AsA(–)) could be achieved under moderately water–stressed condition in conjunction with applying AsA (I85AsA(+)). Implication of AsA tends to minimize the reduction in seed yield due to insufficient water supply, where I85AsA(+) and I85AsA(–), each saved same percentage of water (15.0%) but the reduction in seed yield associated the former treatment was less than that under the latter one. On the other hand, IWUE reached the maximal values in both seasons under I100AsA(+) treatment but, however, without marked differences in comparing to those recorded I85AsA(+) in 2014 season. Moreover, the differences in IWUE values exhibited by I100AsA(–) and I85AsA(+) did not reach the P < 0.05 level of significance in 2015 season, which could reveal the positive role of AsA in alleviating water stress.

N2  - In this study, a stochastic-fuzzy-based fractional programming (SFFP) method is advanced for optimizing water-resources allocation and soil-salinity control under uncertainty. The developed method can address ratio objective optimization problems of complex system in association with stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties, which can help gain in-depth analysis of the interrelationships between marginal effectiveness and system reliability. Then, SFFP is applied to an irrigation region in the lower reach of Amu Darya River basin, where linear crop yield-salinity functions and salt-leaching functions are introduced into the modeling formulation for reflecting the complicated interactions among water resources, soil salinity, arable land, and electricity supply. Solutions under 96 scenarios related to different irrigation efficiencies, water availabilities, and electricity supplies have been obtained. Our findings are: i) increased water availability, electricity supply, and irrigation efficiency result in high marginal benefit; ii) irrigation efficiency is the key factor influencing water allocation patterns for crop irrigation and salt-leaching, promotion of which can facilitate mitigating economic and environmental losses in the water-deficit and soil-salinized region; iii) leaching water allocation patterns for soil-salinity washing is related to salinity characters of crops and regions, and boosting drought- and salt-tolerance crop can be effective in adaption to risks of water scarcity and land salinization. Compared to the conventional approaches, SFFP can generate more flexible alternatives and achieve higher marginal effectiveness. These findings can provide effective decision support to identify desired water management strategies under multiple uncertainties for supporting agricultural sustainability in arid regions.

N2  - Drought is the main factor affecting crop grain yield. Increasing grain yield under drought and crop water use efficiency (WUE) is essential for enhancing world crop production and food availability. The objective of this study, carried out in India on 20 durum wheat cultivars, under three water regimes (full irrigation, limited irrigation and residual soil moisture) and during two seasons, was to investigate the potential use of plant traits (particularly carbon isotope discrimination, Δ, and ash content, ma) to predict grain yield and WUE in wheat. WUE components were estimated using a soil water balance model (Budget) allowing comparison of environments in data scarce situations. A highly significant correlation was noted between grain yield and grain Δ across water regimes. However, the associations between grain yield, Δ and ma were found to depend highly on the water regime and environmental conditions. The association between grain yield and grain Δ was significant under full irrigation in season 1 and under residual soil moisture in season 2. Significant positive correlations were noted in both seasons between grain yield and leaf Δ under residual soil moisture and between grain yield and leaf ash content at anthesis under limited irrigation. A significant correlation was found across environments between grain and leaf Δ and T, the quantity of water transpired during the growth cycle, as estimated by the soil water balance model. T also significantly correlated to grain and leaf ma. Variation in WUE across environments was driven more by runoff, drainage and soil evaporation than by harvest index and transpiration. The associations between WUE and transpiration, runoff and Δ were negative but not significant. WUE was significantly correlated with leaf and grain ma at maturity. The study indicates that Δ and ma can be used as indirect selection criteria for grain yield and suggests that ma is a good predictor of transpiration, grain yield and WUE across environments. The use of mechanistic models that allows differentiating between cultivars should permit in a next future to analyze the relationships between WUE, Δ and ma across cultivars and evaluate the possibility to use these traits as predictors of WUE in wheat breeding programs.

N2  - In regions with a strong seasonal or interannual asymmetry in the distribution of precipitation and higher frequency of droughts, collective irrigation systems are vital infrastructures for agricultural activity. Although operating for decades, several systems have ageing infrastructures, with relevant water losses and pumping energy inefficiencies. Consequently, the systems are not adequately designed or operated to meet current and future water demand. Therefore, rehabilitation to improve water and energy efficiency while ensuring infrastructure, economic sustainability and service quality is crucial. In this sense, comprehensive approaches using performance assessment to support the planning process or benchmarking between water users associations play an essential role in improving efficiency in collective irrigation systems. However, few methodologies assess interdependencies between water losses, energy efficiency, infrastructure condition, service quality, economic and operational dimensions. Additionally, these approaches rarely were applied to the different stages of the planning process (diagnosis, planning, monitoring, and reviewing the impact of measures) and to different types of collective irrigation systems (gravity, pressurised, combined) for comparative analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive performance assessment system (PAS) for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems. Afterwards, the PAS is applied for diagnosis and prioritisation of alternatives to enhance the efficiency of a gravity system. The results indicate significant water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges and leakage in canals and low-pressure pipes, related to network ageing and insufficient flow monitoring and control for the gravity system. Ranking allowed identifying the gravity network area with high priority of intervention due to poor performance in non-revenue water, water losses due to discharges, energy efficiency of pumping stations and system energy in excess. Several alternatives were studied for this network area, and infrastructural solutions involving canal rehabilitation and water discharge control significantly impact global performance improvement besides the substantial investment associated. Subsequently, the PAS is used for comparing gravity and pressurised systems. In opposition to gravity, the pressurised system, with efficient use of water resources, presents a poor performance in pumping energy efficiency. Furthermore, the significant energy costs indicate the importance of energy improvement measures for the pressurised system. Besides assessing water and energy efficiency, the novel PAS may help managers and policymakers identify every system's best practices and weak points.

N1  - High Level Meeting on National Drought Policy
N2  - Drought is one of the major constraints affecting food security and livelihoods of more than two billion people that reside on dry areas which constitute 41% of the world׳s land surface. Drought is defined as deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time resulting in water scarcity. Our best minds should be concentrated where the greatest challenges lie today – on discoveries and new solutions to cope with the challenges facing dry areas particularly drought and water scarcity. In addition to facing severe natural resource constraints caused by the lack of water in many of the developing world׳s drylands, we also have to cope with rapid growth of the younger segment of the growing population, and high levels of poverty. Coping with drought and water scarcity are critical to address major development challenges in dry areas namely poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and social conflict. Drought is a climatic event that cannot be prevented, but interventions and preparedness to drought can help to: (i) be better prepared to cope with drought; (ii) develop more resilient ecosystems (iii) improve resilience to recover from drought; and (iv) mitigate the impacts of droughts. Preparedness strategies to drought include: (a) geographical shifts of agricultural systems; (b) climate-proofing rainfall-based systems; (c) making irrigated systems more efficient; (d) expanding the intermediate rainfed–irrigated systems. The paper presents successful research results and case studies applying some innovative techniques where clear impact is demonstrated to cope with drought and contribute to food security in dry areas. The CGIAR Consortium Research Program (CRP) on “Integrated and Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems for Improved Food Security and Livelihoods in Dry Areas” (in short, “Dryland Systems”), led by ICARDA, was launched in May 2013 with many partners and stakeholders from 40 countries. It addresses farming systems in dry areas, at a global level, involving 80 partner institutions. The Dryland Systems Program aims at coping with drought and water scarcity to enhance food security and reduce poverty in dry areas through an integrated agro-ecosystem approach. It will also deliver science-based solutions that can be adopted in regions that are not yet experiencing extreme shocks, but will be affected in the medium to long-term. The approach entails shifting the thinking away from the traditional focus on a small number of research components to take an integrated approach aiming to address agro-ecosystems challenges. Such an approach involves crops, livestock, rangeland, trees, soils, water and policies. It is one of the first global research for development efforts that brings “systems thinking” to farming innovations leading to improved livelihoods in the developing world. The new technique uses modern innovation platforms to involve all stakeholders, adopting the value chain concept along a research-to-impact pathway for enhanced food security and improved livelihoods in dry areas.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to provide a better insight into the adaptive processes to water deficit of Rosa hybrid plants grown in soilless cultivation. Rose plants were grown in a greenhouse under two water regimes, corresponding to 100% and 67% of the irrigation needs. Watering was stopped for 0, 72, and 96h (dry-down period) and photosynthetic parameters, water relations, chlorophyll fluorescence, carbohydrate and ion content were determined. The imposed drought conditions, in both regimes, caused: (i) a negative effect on the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance but an increase in the intercellular CO2, (ii) a decline in chlorophyll fluorescence (iii) a decrease in transpiration rate and leaf water potential (LWP) but had no effect on relative water content (RWC) and water use efficiency (WUE), (iv) an increase in carbohydrate and potassium content but no change in calcium. The data indicated that the adaptive responses of Rosa ‘Eurored’ to water stress combined with the dry-down program involved mechanisms at both stomatal and non-stomatal level. The plants maintained their metabolic and physiological processes not simply through stomatal closure but also through osmotic adaptation (higher carbohydrate and potassium concentration).

N2  - Farmers' participation in extension training and demonstration programs may unleash farmers' potential and enable them to adopt improved production techniques to bring about sustainable farm productivity improvement. This study applies Poisson model with the endogenous covariate in primary data from 469 farming households in the Mvomero district of Tanzania to determine the effect of the agricultural extension training and demonstration programs on the adoption intensity of rice production technologies practices (RPTPs). The study found that training and demonstration programs improved the adoption intensity of RPTPs by 64.4%, and governments and other stakeholders should invest more in them. Simultaneously, access to irrigation water improves RPTPs adoption intensity, implying that besides the extension programs, the provision of irrigation services is needed to promote rice production technologies and productivity improvement. Therefore, extension training and demonstration programs should incorporate farming training on RPTPs as a set of complementary innovations to guide the adoption of multiple technology practices.

N2  - We describe in this paper the implementation of E-Water, an open
software Decision Support System (DSS), designed to help local managers
assess the Water Energy Food Environment (WEFE) nexus. E-Water aims at
providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production
at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mekrou
river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary
sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing
significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the
productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of
farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient
fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation
of cropland.
In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and
issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the
following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a
simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external
inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multi-objective genetic algorithm
optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and
(4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and
visualization.
To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and
hypothetical scenarios in the Mekrou river basin. The results obtained
show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could
be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and
optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also
affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in
the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal
agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across
the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food
self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural
income.
The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling
decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic
management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would
augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with
increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural
resources, also taking other economic sectors-like livestock, urban or
energy-into account.

N2  - Rainfall insurance which was relatively unknown in India few decades ago is now available with other regions of the country. There exist tremendous benefits from its adoption because rainfall insurance protects against climatic shocks. Despite its potential benefits, available literature suggests that its adoption rate is relatively slow. This study assesses farm households’ both willingness to insure and pay for an innovative rainfall insurance product and identifies various socio-economic factors that influences the purchase of an insurance product in rural India which can manage risk to crop yields associated with flood and drought. A hypothetical rainfall insurance program is designed to know the actual demand of farm households’ for an insurance program using a Contingent Valuation Program in both irrigated and rain-fed regions of rural India. Using Double-hurdle model, this study highlights several determinants of willingness to pay for an insurance product. Empirical results suggest that gender, education, farm experience, income from rice, and land ownership have significant influence on willingness to insure for an insurance program where as education, marital status, farm size, off-farm income source, household size, land ownership, farm age, and awareness found to be significant factor influencing farmers’ WTP for insurance program. The study therefore recommends that the design to implement rainfall insurance scheme should take into consideration the education and awareness level of sample household in these regions. This study provides decision makers with evidence-based tools as a guide so as to effectively promote and develop demand oriented insurance product that meets farmers’ needs.

N2  - Mungbean (Vigna radiate L. Wilczek) is an important pulse crop for South Asian region. Its productivity is low and usually grown under water limited environments. Generally, irrigation at around flowering stage is provided if soil moisture is limiting. Its growth and yield is highly sensitive to fluctuations in climatic conditions, especially water-logging at any growth stage. Present study aimed at developing simple mungbean growth (MungGro) model, following the principles of SUCROS2 and the programme is written in Fortran Simulation Translator (FST). Water balance sub-routine has been undertaken along with G × E interaction, and the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of Bangladesh. Subsequently the model was utilized to evaluate the interaction effects of increased temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Yield, in general, decreased with the rise in temperature, primarily due to reduction in growth duration and seed weight growth rate of the crop. Increased CO2 levels compensated to some extent the deleterious effects of increased temperatures. Water-logging, especially at the beginning of the crop growth stage, had pronounced effect in reducing the grain yield drastically that was also reflected from the model. At present, we have calculated nitrogen (N) uptake and N fixation at the terminal stage of the crop. The model further needs to be improved by including N balance and insect-pest sub-routines.

N2  - During two consecutive years (1988–1989) field experiments were conducted in the region of Trás-os-Montes, N.E. Portugal. The work formed part of a wider research programme assessing the effects of water and nitrogen (N) on the productivity of potatoes in a hot, dry environment. Line-source experiments were carried out using potato crops (Solanum tuberosum, L.) subjected to four N levels (N0, N1, N2 and N3) and five irrigation (I) treatments (I4–I0). The main aims were to characterise crop productivity and develop the drought response factor Ky and the crop yield production functions in relation to rainfall and irrigation (P+I) and to total water-use (ETc), that could be used to assess the benefits of irrigation and fertilisation practices in the region. ETc was monitored by intensive field measurement of soil water content using a neutron probe device. Single values of total water applied (P+I) ranged from 148 to 387mm in 1988 and from 295 to 724mm in 1989. By contrast, single values of ETc (including the contribution from soil water storage), ranged from 230 to 504mm in 1988 and from 330 to 802mm in 1989. Full irrigation increased mean yields of fresh tubers from 11.8 to 24.7t/ha in 1988 and from 13.6 to 49.8t/ha in 1989. Total fresh tuber yield from droughted crops tended to decline with increasing N fertiliser up to 80kg/ha. Yield responses to P+I (52–91kg/(hamm)) and to ETc (62–105kg/(hamm)) varied with fertiliser application. In both years, the relative values of Ky were similar for all three fertilised crops (N1, N2 and N3) regardless of nitrogen dosage. The mean Ky value in 1988 was 0.71 and 1.12 in 1989.

N2  - Field studies were conducted to determine the response of processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) to deficit irrigation (DI) to guide programs for the development of improved irrigation management practices for sub-humid zones. Field experiments were conducted in Bursa province, Turkey. Industrial tomato plants (cv. Shasta) were subjected to different levels of irrigation using a drip system in the field on a clay–loam Entisol soil for 2 years. Well-watered plants were irrigated at100% crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with 3-day intervals. In other treatments, irrigation was not applied during the vegetative, flowering, yield formation or ripening stages or during combinations of these stages. Fruit weight, marketable yield (MY) and net income decreased with decreases in the amount of irrigation depending on the irrigation timing, but the effect of soil water deficit on the shape index was minor. The highest MY and fruit weight were obtained with the full irrigation (100% ETc) treatment. Water deficit by non-irrigation during the flowering and/or yield formation stages substantially reduced MY values in both years. The results showed that full irrigation during the whole growing season is preferable for higher yield and net income. However, in regions of water scarcity, irrigation managers should adopt the DI approach to achieve economically sustainable crop production. As an alternative to full irrigation during the entire growing season, the application of full irrigation until the beginning of the fruit ripening stage and the cessation of full irrigation after that time can be recommended as optimal because it achieved irrigation water savings of 33%, an increase of 42% in irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), a satisfactory fruit soluble solids content (SSC) and an acceptable net income with a yield loss of only approximately 5% compared with full irrigation.

N2  - The impact of climate change on agriculture is projected to be more severe over the coming years due to changing intensity, magnitude and distribution of precipitation, soil water content, atmospheric water vapor, higher temperatures, and thus larger evapotranspiration. This will have significant consequences for irrigation requirements, especially in semi-arid area of Southern Europe, which is recognised as a climate change hotspot. Since the total water use to satisfy agricultural demand is currently about 25% of total water withdrawal in Europe and up to 80% in some Mediterranean countries, improvements in water management are needed to cope with worsening climate conditions. Although several crop models (e.g. EPIC, WOFOST, CERES-Maize) and hydrological models (e.g., DREAM, SWAT, HYDRUS) have been developed, the call for developing models able to couple crop growth, soil water balance, and irrigation practices to assess agricultural water management both at local and regional scale is increasing. In this work, the Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied Water (SIMETAW#) model is implemented in R programming language with two new versions able to estimate crop water consumption, irrigation demand and scheduling at local (SIMETAW_R) and regional scale (SIMETAW_GIS platform) using extensive climate and environmental geospatial datasets. SIMETAW_R was validated in ten experimental sites, and SIMETAW_GIS performance in Mediterranean countries was assessed by estimating the impact of climate change on maize, wheat, and wine grape water requirements in the past (1976–2005) and future climate conditions (2036–2065), under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results show that in Mediterranean countries, maize, wheat, and grape production will require on average about 13%, 16%, and 10% more water, respectively, under future climate. This represents a considerable challenge for water resources management, especially with demand increasing in other sectors. The tool showed great potential in estimating climate change impact on crop water consumption and irrigation requirements, both at local and regional scale, and offers new analytical skills for water resources management planners for improved decision-making.

N2  - Agronomic systems based on zero tillage and residue retention are becoming more important due to their potential for climate change adaptation through the reduction of soil erosion and improved water availability. Denser soil surface conditions and large amounts of crop residues, however, may be a constraint for early plant establishment, especially in irrigated production areas with high yield potential. Genotype by tillage interactions for yield are not well understood and it is unknown whether tillage should be an evaluation factor in breeding programs. Twenty-six CIMMYT bread (Triticum aestivum) and durum (Triticum turgidum) wheat genotypes, created between 1964 and 2009, were tested for yield and agronomic performance at CIMMYT’s experimental station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, over six years. Treatments included conventional and permanent raised beds with full and reduced irrigation. The objectives were to study breeding progress in distinct agronomic systems and to elucidate the importance of tillage and genotype by tillage interaction for yield and agronomic traits. Breeding progress was achieved irrespective of agronomic treatment. Tillage influenced plant growth and number of grains per m2 in both wheat types. In bread wheat, genotype by tillage interaction was significant for yield, test weight, and growth parameters. However, no cross-over effects were detected and rank changes were small. In durum wheat, genotype by tillage interaction was only significant for plant growth. The results do not indicate the need for separate breeding programs. However, the question of a need for selection under zero tillage to increase breeding progress is yet to be answered.

N2  - Developing cities suffer from overpopulation, with direct effects on environmental sustainability issues. Using model sustainability cities to address the problem can help these cities. The cities of Seattle and Florianópolis were used for this research to analyze which water and energy efficiency programs in Seattle buildings can be applied in developing cities such as Florianópolis. This research was elaborated with the approach of the qualitative problem, using a checklist to collect the data in own documents and respective to each city research. The research resulted in a sustainability index of 100% for Seattle and 35% for Florianópolis. In addition, a series of programs have been identified that are carried out in Seattle, but which can serve as a model for mitigating the deficiencies of Florianópolis, such as energy and water conservation, and efficient irrigation equipment. We consider limitations of this research the methodology adopted and the cities surveyed. The research aims to contribute in theoretical aspects with the literature on the sustainability of cities and buildings. In practical aspects, the research aims to contribute to help developing cities to mitigate the impact caused, as well as, the financial and environmental economy, aiming at the growth of the city in an economically viable and environmentally sustainable way.

N2  - Water utilities incentivize turf replacement to promote water conservation, but the effects of such programs have received limited evaluations. In 2014, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) undertook an unprecedented investment to incentive turf replacement throughout Southern California in response to a serious Statewide drought. MWD devoted $350 million to the program, resulting in more than 46,000 rebate payments (25,000 in Los Angeles County) to remove 15.3 million square meters of turf. The program implementation provided a unique opportunity to address research gaps on turf replacement implementation. We analyzed socioeconomic and spatial trends of program participants and assessed landscape changes from turf replacement using a random sample of properties (4% of LA County participants in 2014–16). Specifically, we used a novel and cost-effective approach Google Earth Street View to characterize landscapes in front yards and created a typology of land cover types. Results showed: post-replacement landscapes had a diversity of land cover types – diverse yards with several land cover types, as well as more homogenous yards with a single land cover such as woodchips, bare soil, gravel, and artificial turf. Analysis also indicated some evidence of “neighborhood adoption” effects. We describe the need for longitudinal studies to understand long-term effects of turf replacement and associated water use, and suggest that water utilities should also evaluate results in backyards, which requires site visits. This study provides a novel contribution that can be replicated over space and time to further knowledge of turf replacement program implementations and evaluation.

N2  - Nowadays improving the method of design in agriculture using new technologies is a common issue. Irrigation system plays an important role in productivity and some new methods are proposed in this domain. As most of the proposed models are more focused on performance criteria, their obtained design have problems in terms of practicality and feasibility. This paper presents a simulation-optimization model for designing a surface irrigation system. The main innovation of the proposed model is its special focus on the feasibility in real issues. It gives an optimal and feasible surface irrigation system by fuzzy expert systems and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Five fuzzy expert systems analyze the feasibility level of the obtained irrigation system using inference rules which are proposed by expert farmers, and 10 meta-heuristic optimization algorithms optimize the irrigation system based on the fuzzy expert systems outputs. Experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed model. Parameters of 14 fields with different irrigation systems were used in the experiments. The experimental results were re-evaluated by two well-known simulator software programs as SIRMOD and WinSRFR, the obtained results validate the performance of the simulation part of the model. The results of the experiments were compared with the results of three other simulation-optimization models. It was found that the designs presented by the proposed model provide more favorable results in terms of quality, practicality and labor. The designs provided by the proposed model on average reduce labor by 10%, increase practicality by 9% and improve performance by 13%.

N2  - Due to its extraordinary biodiversity and rapid deforestation, north-eastern Madagascar is a conservation hotspot of global importance. Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests, shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being.

N2  - A Brazilian produce plant was evaluated according to good agricultural practices (GAPs) using a checklist. The agricultural water was sampled for total and faecal coliform and Escherichia coli counts. Equipment/handler sanitary facilities, the handling of agrochemicals and pesticides, records of the composting process, prior analysis of the irrigation water for the identification of heavy metals and pesticide residues, inadequate temperature control of the raw material storage room, qualified person to manage the operations and periodic training programmes on food manipulation, hygiene and microbiology, were the main critical points found during the inspection. Microbiological analyses of the irrigation water gave counts between 0.3 and 1.2logMPN/ml for total and faecal coliforms, respectively and absence of E. coli. The results are discussed and the necessary corrections suggested in order to improve process safety.

N1  - Supplement on Sea Lamprey International Symposium III (SLIS III)
N2  - Lampreys worldwide face multiple anthropogenic stressors. Several species are ‘at-risk’ listed, yet abundance data for most remain insufficient to adequately assess conservation status. Lamprey population declines are largely due to habitat degradation and fragmentation, pollution, and exploitation. Conservation priorities include: quantification of population trends and distribution; identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units; improved water quality and habitat; barrier removal or effective mitigation; ecologically-sensitive river flow management and hydropower planning; and mitigation of climate change impacts. There is urgent need for ecological and population demographics data for multiple species, particularly those in the Southern Hemisphere, Caspian Sea region, and Mexico. Irrigation and damming are already extensive, or rapidly expanding (e.g. Chile), while water-stressed regions (Mexico, California, Chile, Australia, Iberia) may be further impacted by climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures. Barrier removal should benefit lampreys by increasing available habitat. However, fishways vary in effectiveness and are often inadequate, but present research opportunities encompassing ecohydraulics, biotelemetry and engineering. Environmental DNA permits rapid assessment of lamprey distribution within catchments, especially if improvements to distinguishing genetically similar groups are possible. Marine environments may play a critical role in population dynamics yet remain a “black box” in anadromous lamprey biology. Studying juvenile lamprey ecology is a substantial challenge but should be a priority. Some examples are monitoring of parasitic feeding-phase lamprey through trawl surveys and fisheries bycatch, telemetry of movements, or examining chemical tracers of marine habitat use. Knowledge transfer between the sea lamprey control programme and native-lamprey biologists worldwide remains crucial to developing effective lamprey management.

N2  - The aim of this study is to develop a multi-objective decision-making method, named Simultaneous Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives (SECA) for optimal ranking of wastewater allocation alternatives. This multi-objective decision-making method is for the continuous environment, meaning that experts can choose the best solution among the solutions obtained. The SECA multi-objective non-linear programming method has three objective functions: (i) maximization of the overall performance of alternatives, (ii) minimization of the deviation of criterion weights from reference point based on the within-criteria variation information, and (iii) minimization of the deviation of criterion weights based on the between-criteria variation information as well as two limitations for the weights of criteria. First, 15 criteria from different fields, including economic, socio-cultural, technological, and environmental, and six alternatives were determined for reusing wastewater, including reuse in the industrial sector, for recreational consumption, supplying environmental demand, artificial aquifer recharge, agricultural irrigation, and landscape irrigation. Then, decision-making matrix was constructed and reference points were calculated. By programming the SECA code in Lingo software and considering different β values, different weights for criteria and alternatives were ranked. In the other words, determining the best value for β was the most important step, so different values for β from 0.1 to 10 were examined. Results showed that in the value of β equal to 4, the maximum value of the objective function was obtained as 0.6926. Therefore, it was the best value for β and the weight of the effects on water resources criterion was equal to 0.0957 and was the most important criterion, and the allocation alternative in the environmental sector with a score of 0.8575 was the best wastewater allocation alternative. Followed by the environmental sector alternative, landscape irrigation, industrial sector, artificial aquifer recharge, agricultural irrigation, and recreational consumption were placed. Therefore, water supply for the environmental sector by considering the effect of wastewater on water resources is the best alternative for optimal allocation of wastewater.

N2  - Recent research has highlighted the positive role of green areas in urban environments, providing numerous social, environmental and economic services, such as mitigation of the urban heat island effect, storm attenuation, increased water infiltration into the soil, reduction of noise and air pollution, among others. However, the maintenance of green areas may result in high consumption of water, reaching 50% of the total consumption in some municipalities, and energy, becoming a reason of concern. The present study aimed to integrate techniques and technologies that promote the automatic and efficient irrigation of urban landscapes, using alternative sources of energy and water, toward its sustainability. The conceptual unit was able to reduce in 64% the water consumed in irrigation. Rainwater met 69% of the demand and the photovoltaic system supplied all the energy required. The economic feasibility analysis showed that the conceptual unit is financially unfeasible, under the conditions of this study. However, with some interventions for reusing the surplus energy and water, and considering the higher fees charged by other cities, the investment became attractive. In this new scenario, the internal rate of return (15 years) was 27.3% and the discounted payback period was 4.9 years. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Many aquifers in semi-arid and arid regions with rapid urbanization are over-exploited or even at the point of depletion. Driven by the increased demand for food and other agricultural products, irrigated agriculture constitutes the biggest user of groundwater, and has thus contributed to this critical situation. In this paper, we compare different designs of groundwater management institutions in order to avoid aquifer over-exploitation and ensure secure water sources. We assess externally imposed reward-based and punishment rules as well as communication on their effectiveness to reduce water extraction behavior of groundwater users. Moreover, we evaluate how different user types affect the outcome of these institutional designs. To do so, we conducted a framed field experiment with 600 households along the rural-urban interface of the fast growing city of Bengaluru, India. Results indicate that all treatments can prolong the life of the resource but reward-based and punishment rules seem to be more effective than communication. Moreover, we find that user type behavior identified in the baseline trial is persistent in the treatment trial despite interventions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The survival of more than 40% of the country’s population such as India, Ethiopia, and others whose one-fourth of the GDP is based on agricultural products. Therefore, agriculture plays a significant role in the country’s growth. The government’s growth is constantly hampered by issues that relate to agriculture. A feasible solution to this issue is to opt for developed and modern farming that includes modern trends. Thus, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to smart agriculture. Smart farming increases crop production, decreases water wastage, and minimizes excessive fertilizer usage. With the aid of detectors, this IoT-based system can help farms track terrain requirements anywhere and can even irrigate fields using an automatic device. World agriculture’s future needs to be sorted out through awareness and unnecessary cessation technology that can increase productivity and, in turn, restore farmers’ interest in this sector. So these smart farming strategies will help farmers minimize scrap and increase efficiency. It is certainly a glorified tech and capital-intensive crop cultivation system for the general public in a responsible way. The problems like adverse weather conditions, enviromental effect on cultivation, etc. that farmers are facing inspired us for the suggested programs that are: Global farming is on the snag due to the limited technical awareness of best and productive farming methods and furthermore they are still relying on traditional farming methods that lead to lower crop productivity. This chapter addresses a methodology to solve these problems by considering different agricultural parameters that influence yields; this also uses a GPS system to obtain geolocation data. Furthermore, it sends all information to the server where it can be investigated further. Finally, this methodology also includes a mobile application that provides the farmer with convenient access to the data.

N2  - The phenotyping of secondary characters is a common practice in breeding programs aiming at finding physiological mechanism related to drought tolerance. However, the dynamics of these characters depend on crop phenology, levels of water shortage, and other factors that affect their relationship with yield and limit their capacity to be used for predictive purposes. In this work, we compared tuber yield with the temporal trend (using accumulated thermal time) of chlorophyll concentration (ChlSPAD), osmotic potential, and relative water content under water restriction. UNICA, a potato variety characterized by its low drought susceptibility was tested under full irrigation (as a control) and different treatments of partial root-zone drying and deficit irrigation in greenhouse and field conditions. ChlSPAD was the only trait showing a concurrent changing trend (slope) with yields, particularly in field conditions. The rate of greenness loss or senescence was slower in the higher water restriction treatments, which indicates that the stay-green effect (delayed senescence) occurs in some potato varieties. ChlSPAD at the loss of half the maximum plant cover during senescence (between 1040 and 1170°C days) was high and negatively correlated with final yield in all irrigation treatments. Our findings suggest that during senescence, chlorophyll increment is not related to a rise of carbon assimilation (non-functional stay-green), but could be associated with an oxidative stress occurrence, ultimately reducing yield.

N2  - Economic performance of two land configuration systems, namely conservation bench terrace (CBT) and conventional (sloping borders), were evaluated through an experimental study conducted during 1997-2005 in a sub-humid climate of India. Energy use efficiencies of the two systems were also evaluated. The two systems were cultivated with maize + cowpea in rainy season followed by wheat + mustard in dry winter season. For CBT, an additional intervention of rice cultivation was done during rainy season in its recipient area. Mathematical relationships were established between seasonal and effective rainfalls as well as between effective rainfall and crop equivalent yields. These relationships were then utilized for evaluating economic efficiency of various combinations of the two inter-crop based land configuration systems. Excess runoff from the combinations was considered as rainwater harvested into a common tank for recycling as supplemental irrigation during intervening dry spells in the rainy season and the remaining during dry winter season. In this way, the best combination for inter-crop based systems adoptable to a region experiencing rainfall uncertainty i.e. regular intervening dry spells was identified. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze response of the combinations to changes in economic parameters. Based on the analysis of experimental data, net present value of CBT system was observed to be 56% higher than the conventional system due to higher average crop equivalent yields. Net energy return, energy ratio and energy profitability of CBT system were higher by more than 100% as compared to conventional system, thus indicating better energy use efficiency. Benefit-cost analysis of the system combinations under different rainfall probabilities suggested that a combination with higher proportion of CBT will be more remunerative. However, the 75:25 (CBT:conventional) combination was observed to be the best for minimizing risks associated with erratic rainfall at all probability levels. Sensitivity analysis of various combinations indicated that CBT predominant combinations will be least affected by changes in considered economic parameters. From the study, it was concluded that adoption of 75:25 (CBT:conventional) combination can be recommended for sustaining crop productivity by generating sufficient runoff for harvesting and its subsequent recycling as supplemental irrigation during both seasons on mildly sloping lands in sub-humid climates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Nutrient management, water quality protection, and irrigation efficiency top the list of on-farm resource concerns indicating a need to address them through conservation strategies. A suite of Best Management Practices (BMPs) has been identified and recommended, through several outlets, to farmers to ameliorate these concerns. This research examines the adoption of strategies that ameliorate the resource concerns as a joint decision, using a bivariate model. Data from the 2016 Nutrient Management Survey, conducted by the Louisiana Master Farmer Program, are used to examine the factors affecting adoption of these conservation practices. A bivariate probit regression found significant results for explanatory variables and emphasize the effect of perception regarding the role of on-farm practices, ownership of land, participation in conservation programs in the past, and producers educational attainment on the likelihood of adopting the conservation practices. Implications for policy development and educational programs are discussed.

N2  - This study investigates the effect of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs on common pool resource management in the context of village collective-managed irrigation systems (VMISs) in China. Drawing on institutional bricolage theory, we propose that the functioning of a PES program depends on its combination with local institutions. We infer transaction cost-reduction and trust-strengthening mechanisms as the two pathways for institutional bricolage to illustrate the process whereby a PES program enables a VMIS to internalise positive externalities. Based on data from a field survey at the household level, our empirical results confirm that a PES program is an effective means of improving the performance of VMISs in terms of environmental, economic, and equitable benefits, because it aligns benefits for the village collective with those for the overall society. We conclude that a PES program is of greater benefit to communities with local institutions and that PES programs and local institutions exert an interactive impact as they reinforce each other's effect on common pool resource management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Watermelon yield loss due to Fusarium wilt is increasing in the U.S., due in part to the emergence of the virulent race 2 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, and to the shift in production to triploid cultivars, which generally have less host resistance than previously grown diploid cultivars. One potential management strategy is the use of soil-applied fungicides to reduce Fusarium wilt. The U.S. national program, interregional project 4 (IR-4) supported multistate trials of soil-applied chemicals to manage Fusarium wilt of watermelon. Greenhouse trials were conducted in Maryland, Indiana and Georgia to test the efficacy of 14 chemicals on Fusarium wilt. Based on the performance of these chemicals in the greenhouse, six in Maryland and Delaware and eight in Indiana were selected for subsequent field evaluations. These chemicals were applied once, as a drench at planting, in field trials in Maryland, Indiana, and Delaware in 2008. The fungicides prothioconazole, acibenzolar-S-methyl, and thiophanate-methyl resulted in the greatest reduction in Fusarium wilt, and caused no phytotoxicity. In Maryland and Indiana in 2009, these chemicals were applied through the drip irrigation line alone and in combination, at 0, 2 and 4 weeks after planting. The experiment was repeated in 2010 in Maryland. Prothioconazole alone and in combination with acibenzolar-S-methyl or/and thiophanate-methyl resulted in the greatest decrease in the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of Fusarium wilt of watermelon in Maryland in 2009. The same trend was observed in 2010 in Maryland where three of the prothioconazole treatments ranked the lowest of all treatments and prothioconazole in combination with thiophanate-methyl had significantly lower Fusarium wilt AUDPC compared to the non-treated control. All chemical applications except for acibenzolar-S-methyl in combination with prothioconazole reduced Fusarium wilt AUDPC in Indiana in 2009. Prothioconazole alone and prothioconazole in combination with thiophanate-methyl ranked lowest in Fusarium wilt AUDPC, although not significantly lower than most other treatments. These studies are the first to demonstrate that the soil-applied fungicides prothioconazole and thiophanate-methyl may provide an additional field management option for Fusarium wilt of watermelon.

N1  - Policies and Tools for Sustainable Water Management in the European Union
N2  - The paper reports the first results of the Project WADI (Sustainability of European Irrigated Agriculture under Water Directive and Agenda 2000), funded under the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union (EU). The objective of the project is to evaluate the economic, social and environmental sustainability of European irrigated farming under different scenarios concerning water policy and the Common Agricultural Policy. The methodology relies on scenario analysis combined with farm level mathematical programming models. Two pilot case studies are presented for Italy: cereal farming and fruit farming. According to the first results, the impact of the directive, up to reasonable prices, may be summed up in a minor reduction of water use associated with a sharp decrease of farm income and a significant reduction of employment. Nevertheless, different farming systems may react in very different ways. More detailed local analyses are needed in order to support the design of effective and efficient policies at basin level.

N2  - In this study, integration of analytic hierarchy process method and entropy method (AHP-EW) for quantifying the knowledge and experience accumulated by regional managers as well as the socioeconomic situation, the partial least squares regression (PLS) for reflecting the relationship between irrigation water use efficiency and agronomic inputs, and the ecosystem service value for measuring environmental impacts of changing crop planting area were considered in one framework simultaneously. With help of these efforts, a bi-level multiobjective stochastic approach to improve irrigation water use efficiency and decrease the pollution production of agronomic measures in the process of agricultural production. The proposed framework integrate bi-level multiobjective programming and stochastic expectation programming to not only make tradeoffs among multiple concerns from two-level decision makers, but also deal with the randomness of runoff. Then, the proposed approach was applied to a real-world case in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. Results show that the developed approach can improve irrigation water use efficiency, reduce CO2 emission, expand ecosystem service values, and provide more profitable and environment-friendly agricultural planting strategies to decision makers, which can further contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture. Furthermore, by comparing the bi-level multiobjective stochastic programming (BMSP) model with the other six models originated from developed model, it can be found that 1) the single objective model can obtain the best value of that objective, but cannot readily consider other important aspects; 2) the multiobjective models can make tradeoffs among multiple objectives; 3) the BMSP model can reflect the leader-follower relationship in the optimization process. The approach is applicable for arid and semiarid regions that face similar problems to determine agricultural planting strategies.

N2  - The present paper studies the effects of alternative modifications of a subsidy for electricity used to pump groundwater on the behavior of profit maximizing groundwater users. It proposes a stylized model for groundwater extraction, and then numerically derives general results by simulation. The model is applied to aquifers in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico and Kern County, California. The performance of two traditional policy intervention measures—subsidy elimination and reduction—are compared to a new, innovative modification policy, namely, decoupling the subsidy from the electricity bill; this policy is arguably more politically acceptable. The results of extensive simulations suggest that the rate of aquifer water extraction, and the consequent level of water in the aquifer, can be improved significantly by changing the subsidy structure.

N2  - Surface water is one of the primary sources of irrigation water for produce production; therefore, its contamination by foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella, may substantially impact public health. In this study, we determined the presence of Salmonella in surface water and characterized the relationship between Salmonella detection and environmental and anthropogenic factors. From April 2019 to February 2020, 120 samples from 30 sites were collected monthly in four watersheds located in two different central Chile agricultural regions (N = 1080). Water samples from rivers, canals, streams, and ponds linked to each watershed were obtained. Surface water (10 L) was filtrated in situ, and samples were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella. Salmonella was detected every month in all watersheds, with a mean detection percentage of 28% (0%–90%) across sampling sites, regardless of the season. Overall, similar detection percentages were observed for both regions: 29.1% for Metropolitan and 27.0% for Maule. Salmonella was most often detected in summer (39.8% of all summer samples tested positive) and least often in winter (14.4% of winter samples). Random forest analysis showed that season, water source, and month, followed by latitude and river, were the most influential factors associated with Salmonella detection. The influences of water pH and temperature (categorized as environmental factors) and factors associated with human activity (categorized as anthropogenic factors) registered at the sampling site were weakly or not associated with Salmonella detection. In conclusion, Salmonella was detected in surface water potentially used for irrigation, and its presence was linked to season and water source factors. Interventions are necessary to prevent contamination of produce, such as water treatment before irrigation.

N2  - Ensuring safe irrigation practices is vital to sustaining food production in water-scarce delta areas. Bangladesh and many other developing countries discharge untreated wastewater into their surrounding surface water bodies, serving as the primary irrigation source. This indirect irrigation of wastewater is believed to pose threats to the farmers, consumers and market vendors and may also affect crop and soil quality. To assess the risk, peri-urban farmers who use surrounding water bodies of Khulna city, Bangladesh, for crop irrigation were selected for the study. The microbial and heavy metal concentrations were measured in water samples collected from various locations over different seasons. For heavy metals As, Co, Ni, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb, concentrations were below the detection limit, whereas Al, Fe, Mn, Ti and Zn were present but below the FAO recommendation limit for safe irrigation. The mean concentrations of microbial parameters were above the thresholds of WHO guidelines for crop irrigation intended for human consumption. Significant temporal variations in Faecal Coliform, E. coli and Enterococcus concentrations in the water samples were observed. The annual risk of infection for farmers was determined using the screening-level Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). The results indicated that the annual probability of infection with pathogenic E. coli in different seasons ranges between 5 × 10−3 to 5 × 10−2, above the WHO's acceptable threshold for annual risk of infection for safe water reuse in agriculture. During the farmers' survey, around 45% reported health-related issues and more than 26% reported suffering from water-borne diseases after getting in contact with polluted surface water. This illustrates the actuality of the risks in practice. To ensure safe irrigation, the health risks need to be reduced below the acceptable limits. Suggested technical measures include adequate treatment of wastewater before disposal into rivers and access to protective equipment for farmers. This should be complemented by raising awareness through education programs among farmers to reduce accidental ingestion.

N2  - The vast majority of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa depend on rainfed agriculture for food production and livelihood. Various factors including but not limited to rainfall variability, land degradation, and low soil fertility constrain agricultural productivity in the region. The objectives of this study were to 1) estimate the water resources potential to sustain small-scale irrigation (SSI) in Ethiopia during the dry season so as to expand food supply by growing vegetables, and 2) understand the gaps and constraints of vegetable production. The case studies were conducted in the Robit and Dangishta watersheds of the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. To document farmers’ cropping practices, field-level data were collected from 36 households who had been cultivating tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and onion (Allium cepa L.) during the dry season (November – April). Two components of the Integrated Decision Support System (IDSS) - the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) – were respectively used to assess impacts of SSI at the watershed and field-scale levels. Results suggest that there is a substantial amount of surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge at the watershed scale. The field-scale analysis in the Robit watershed indicated that optimal tomato yield could be obtained with 500 mm of water and 200 to 250 kg/ha of urea applied with 50 kg/ha of diammonium phosphate (DAP). In Dangishta, optimum onion yield can be obtained with 400 mm of water and 120 to 180 kg/ha of urea applied with 50 kg/ha of DAP. The field-scale simulation indicated that the average shallow groundwater recharge (after accounting for other groundwater users such as household and livestock use) was not sufficient to meet tomato and onion water demand in the dry season (October to April). The field-scale analysis also indicated that soil evaporation attributed a significant proportion of evapotranspiration (60% for onion and 40% for tomato). Use of mulching or other soil and water conservation interventions could optimize irrigation water for vegetable production by reducing soil evaporation and thereby increasing water availability in the crop root zone.

N2  - This paper developed a remote-sensing-based multiobjective (RSM) approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale. To meet the spatial resolution and accuracy need of agricultural management, downscaled precipitation data sets were obtained with the help of global precipitation measurement (GPM) data and other spatial information. Spatial crop water requirement information were obtained via the combination use of the Penman-Monteith method, remote sensing information (MOD16/PET) and virtual water theory. Through integrating these spatial data and considering the impact of different spatial environments on crop growth, a grid-based integer multiobjective programming (GIMP) model was developed to determine best suitable crop planting types at all grids. GIMP can simultaneously consider several conflicting objectives: crop growth suitability, crop spatial water requirements, and ecosystem service value. Further, GIMP results were inputted into a grid-based nonlinear fractional multiobjective programming (GNFMP) model with three objectives: maximize economic benefits, maximize water productivity, and minimize blue water utilization, to optimize irrigation-water allocation. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, a real-world application in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China was conducted. Results show that the proposed method can improve the ecosystem service value by 0.36 × 108 CNY, the economic benefit by 21.85%, the irrigation-water productivity by 25.92%, and reduce blue water utilization rate by 24.32% comparing with status quo.

N2  - Climate change poses a big challenge to rural livelihoods in the Shire Valley area of Southern Malawi, where communities have depended almost entirely on rain-fed agriculture for generations. The Shire Valley area comprises of low-altitude dambo areas and uplands which have been the main agricultural areas. Since early to mid 1980s, the uplands have experienced prolonged droughts and poor rainfall distribution, while the dambos have experienced recurrent seasonal floods. This study assessed some of the adaptive strategies exercised by small-scale rural farmers in response to climate change in the Shire Valley. The methodology used in collecting information includes group discussions, household surveys in the area, secondary data, and field observations. The results show that small-scale rural farmers exercise a number of adaptive strategies in response to climate change. These adaptive strategies include: increased use of water resources for small-scale irrigation or wetland farming, mostly using simple delivery techniques; increased management of residual moisture; and increased alternative sources of income such as fishing and crop diversity. It was also observed that government promoted the use of portable motorized pumps for small-scale irrigation in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, these external interventions were not fully adopted; instead the farmers preferred local interventions which mostly had indigenous elements.

These are mainly agricultural activities, notably irrigation, with more than 2000ha currently under irrigation and approximately 2000ha planned for future expansion. Other anthropogenic activities include urban development and weir construction along the Orange River. Population increase along the river has resulted in proliferation of unplanned settlements with no proper sanitation facilities. This study was aimed at assessing the current water quality and overall health status of the Orange River in Namibia. The South African Scoring System 5(SASS5) was applied in eight sites where samples for macroinvertebrates, physical and chemical water quality parameters such as nutrients in the water, pH, turbidity and presence of bacteria were obtained. Satellite images i.e. Landsat images were also used to assess the land-uses over time in the study area with the view of linking such changes to variance in water quality over time. The SASS5 results indicated a fair water quality and river health condition in category C, indicating that the river is moderately modified. Water quality parameters at all sites varied moderately and were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity and chlorophyll a. There was a significant difference in the mean concentrations of nine water quality parameters among sampling periods, whereby F-value>F-critical at α=0.05 among sites, F-value<F-critical at α=0.05, except for turbidity and chlorophyll a. The Landsat images also showed minimal changes in land-use activities between 2002 and 2012, with a net increase of 38ha in irrigated area. According to National Water Policy White Paper of Namibia of 2000, it was found that policies and legislation address water resources management from a broader spectrum and not specific to river health. Thus, it was concluded that the river health of Orange River is still within acceptable range despite the fact that there is an urgent need to develop an effective and sustainable water quality monitoring and development programme.

N2  - Integrated watershed management (IWSM) was implemented to address issues of poverty and land resource degradation in the 14,500 ha upper Agula watershed, in semi-arid Eastern Tigray (Ethiopia), an area known for poverty and resource degradation caused by natural and man-made calamities. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of IWSM and determine the land use and cover dynamics that it has induced. The change in land use and cover was assessed by integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Two sets of aerial photographs (taken in 1965 and 1994 at scale of 1:50,000) and Landsat ETM+ image (taken in 2000 with 30 m resolution) were used to produce the land use/land cover map and assess land use change. The results reveal significant modification and conversion of land use and cover of the watershed over the last four decades (1965-2005). A significant portion of the watershed was continuously under intensively cultivated (rainfed) land. The area under irrigation increased from 7 ha to 222.4 ha post-intervention. The area under dense forest increased from 32.4 ha to 98 ha. The study further shows that IWSM decreased soil erosion, increased soil moisture, reduced sedimentation and run off, set the scene for a number of positive knock-on effects such as stabilization of gullies and river banks, rehabilitation of degraded lands. IWSM also resulted in increased recharge in the subsurface water. This study reconfirms the importance of IWSM as a key to improve the land cover of watersheds, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable livelihood. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Critical water shortages, triggered by increasing demands and decreasing supplies, are growing in frequency and spatial extent pausing major challenges for water resources managers around the world. This paper presents an integer linear programming decision support model for the optimal treatment and allocation of water resources. The model seeks to minimize the total water cost which includes the economic cost of treatment and distribution, as well as the associated environmental costs. The model is unique in its ability to account for spatially distributed water supply and demand nodes, as well as multiple water supply (seawater, surface, ground and wastewater) and demand (irrigation, potable, and industrial) types and qualities. It accommodates various treatment technologies, different energy recovery levels, and resource availabilities or capacities. The optimal solution yields volumes of water transported from each supply source to each treatment plant and treated by an appropriate technology in order to satisfy multiple water demands at different required water qualities with the lowest overall economic and environmental costs. The model is applied to a case study. Results showed that the distance of brackish water sources and the environmental cost, observed in terms of carbon savings only, had limited impact on the optimal solution with the demand for the base case being met through a combination of conventional water and wastewater treatment and brackish water reverse osmosis. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effects of variations in demand/supply volumes as well as variable distances and environmental cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that increased demand under limited resources can be met through the introduction of seawater desalination plants, initially through multi effect distillation combined with residual thermal energy then augmented with seawater reverse osmosis plants with further increase in demand.

N2  - Runoff and drainage from fields planted with neonicotinoid-coated seeds often contain insecticides that adversely affect aquatic life and other non-target organisms. Management practices such as in-field cover cropping and edge-of-field buffer strips may reduce insecticide mobility, making it important to understand the ability of different plants used in these interventions to absorb neonicotinoids. In this greenhouse study we evaluated uptake of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, in six plant species – crimson clover, fescue, oxeye sunflower, Maximillian sunflower, common milkweed, and butterfly milkweed – along with a native forb mixture and a native grass plus native forb mixture. All plants were irrigated with water containing 100 or 500 μg/L of thiamethoxam for 60 days, then plant tissues and soils were analyzed for thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin. Crimson clover accumulated up to 50% of the applied thiamethoxam, which was significantly more than other plants and indicates this species may be a hyper-accumulator that can sequester thiamethoxam. In contrast, milkweed plants had relatively low neonicotinoid uptake (<0.5%), meaning that those species may not pose excessive risk to beneficial insects that feed on them. In all plants, accumulated masses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin were greater in above-ground tissues (leaves and stems) than in below-ground roots, with more accrual in leaves than stems. Plants treated with the higher thiamethoxam concentration retained proportionally more of the insecticides. Because thiamethoxam primarily accumulates in above-ground tissues, management strategies that include biomass removal may reduce the input of such insecticides into the environment.

N2  - Since the 21st century, the natural runoff from the headwater region of the Yellow River has generally been decreasing, resulting in a particularly prominent contradiction in utilization of water resources. In this study, key components were identified from the perspective of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, and a WEF nexus model was established for the Upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB), taking into consideration the benefits of water supply to the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River, food growth in major food-producing areas in the UYRB and hydropower utilization of the UYR reservoir system. The Multi-start Solver of LINGO and the ε constraint method were used to carry out multi-objective optimization, revealing the trade-off between the WEF benefits. 1) The model computed the Pareto non-inferior set of solutions for the electricity generated by the UYR reservoir system and the degree to which the water demands of the main intake areas (Ningxia and Inner Mongolia irrigated areas, and Toudaoguai section) are satisfied, quantifying the improvement room for the overall benefits brought about by the jointly optimal operation of the WEF sectors. 2) The historical operation of Longyangxia Reservoir, a multi-year storage reservoir, was evaluated, the results of which show that the realization of the WEF benefits is determined by the proper operation of Longyangxia Reservoir. To guarantee the overall benefits in the long term, Longyangxia Reservoir should maintain a high water level. 3) The trade-offs between the WEF benefits under different boundary conditions were discussed, including various initial/final fore-bay water levels of Longyangxia Reservoir and inflows of various total water amounts from the headwater region of the UYRB. The research reveals the WEF nexus in the UYRB under different scenarios, and moreover, the formulated multi-objective optimization model is a good example that can be extended to other similar WEF nexus systems worldwide.

N2  - High levels of mortality after installation can limit the long-term benefits associated with urban tree planting initiatives. Past planting projects funded by the Florida Forest Service were revisited two to five years after installation to document tree survival and growth and assess program success. Additionally, various site (e.g., soil compaction, installed irrigation) and tree-related (e.g., species, nursery production method, initial size at planting) factors were noted to assess their impact on tree growth. Results show that the overall establishment rate for the 26 sites (n=2354 trees) was high, with 93.6% of trees alive at the time of final inspection. On-site irrigation played a significant role in tree survival and growth, especially for Magnolia grandiflora (97.7% survival on irrigated sites; 73.8% survival on non-irrigated sites). Findings from this work validate the effectiveness of current program policies which include maintenance of tree quality within the first year after planting, and offer further insights regarding the impacts of season of planting and initial size of nursery stock on plant growth and development.

N2  - The main objective of this study was to determine canopy-air temperature
differential, which can be used to quantify crop water stress index
(CWSI) for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) grown with drip irrigation
during the spring cultivation period of 2005. Specifically, crop
response to water loss, atmospheric temperature and air vapor pressure
deficit (VPD) in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum were examined to
detect crop water stress. The effects of three irrigation programs (when
depleted 30, 50 and 70% of the available water holding capacity within
0.90 m soil profile depth) on two grape cultivar (semillon and razaki)
yields, and resulting CWSI were investigated. The non-irrigation
treatment (NI) was also used for determination of fully stressed
baseline. The lower (non-stressed) and upper (stressed) baselines were
determined from measurements of canopy temperatures, ambient air
temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values and the CWSI was
calculated with three irrigation levels using the empirical approach.
The CWSI value was useful for evaluating crop water stress in grapevine
and should be useful for timing irrigation and predicting yield. (C)

N2  - Drought is the most important limitation to sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production in the UK and other areas dependent on usually insufficient summer rainfall. As increased irrigation is not a viable answer to the problem, an economically and environmentally desirable solution is new varieties with decreased sensitivity to water deficits. However, there is little genotypic information on drought tolerance in sugar beet, and breeders are not equipped to make these selections. The objectives of this study were to assess the degree of genotypic diversity for drought-related morpho-physiological traits and to measure the strength of association between these traits and indicators of crop performance. 46 sugar beet genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds were tested in three field experiments from 1999 to 2001. Drought was imposed by covering plots with large polythene tunnels, allowing the crop to grow solely on stored soil moisture. Agronomic characters and drought tolerance indices are described in a companion paper [Ober et al., Assessing the genetic resources to improve drought tolerance in sugar beet. Agronomic traits of diverse genotypes under droughted and irrigated conditions. Field Crops Res., in press]. In this report, we show that there were significant genotypic differences for stomatal conductance, succulence index, specific leaf weight, and osmotic adjustment, but not for photosynthetic rate, relative water content or total water use. Patterns of water use within the soil profile differed between genotypes; some extracted more water from deep soil layers. The maintenance of green foliage cover during drought was positively correlated with drought tolerance index, which was negatively correlated with succulence index and scores for wilting and leaf senescence. Droughted sugar yield was positively correlated with soil water extraction and negatively correlated with relative leaf expansion rate measured in late summer. Under irrigated conditions, there was high positive correlation between transpiration rate and sugar yield. Genotype × trait biplots showed superior genotypes with relatively greater expression of combinations of favourable traits. The results suggest that succulence index and wilting score could be used to cull inferior plants in early stages of breeding programs, and green foliage cover and patterns of water use could help identify superior genotypes in elite germplasm. These data should enable tools to be developed for indirect selection of genotypes suited to drought-prone environments.

N2  - Climate Change and its effects in water scarcity has become an important challenge for cities with water management problems. These problems require an integral planning of the city, which can be supported by optimization. The main goal of the research is to provide a regional optimization model for water networks, including new treatment options. The model is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer programming problem, focused on environmental and economic impact of the network, minimizing water extracted from natural sources and total cost. The formulation is developed with the goal-programming methodology. The model covers a complete existing city-scale water network, including 4 different options of water reuse within the city: drinking water, fresh water, irrigation, and discharge in natural courses. The case study is Santiago, capital of Chile, which is the political, economic, and institutional center of Chile. If both objective functions have equal importance to configure the solution, the following ideas characterize the optimal water network: (i) it is more environmentally and economically convenient to reuse water within the network rather than recycling water to the natural source; (ii) the reuse of water is preferred in the form of irrigation and drinking qualities rather than industrial qualities to reduce transport costs, and (iii) the modification of the current treatment plants is preferred, because of the high cost of installation of new plants. An environmental and cost-effective solution for Santiago, Chile, can reduce the source water extraction in 35.7%. The model can be implemented in other contexts, providing orientations to decision-makers so as to plan city-scale water networks with simultaneous environmental and economic considerations.

N2  - The potential impacts of climate variability and change on water
resources and food security are receiving growing attention especially
in regions that face growing, challenges meeting water demands for
agricultural, domestic and environmental uses. Rainfed agriculture
regions exhibit higher vulnerability to climate variability and change,
where aquifer storage and food security are under stress. Little
research has attempted to investigate the consequences of climate
variability and change on water availability and social livelihoods
jointly. Employing available data on precipitation, farm budget data,
and aquifer characteristics, a dynamic nonlinear optimization framework
that maximizes the economic likelihoods of irrigation activities and
food security under several climatic assumptions is developed and
applied for Barbados as a numerical example. Our framework accounts for
technological adaptation measure, drip irrigation, with the context of
variable yield and cost of water demand under governmental subsidy
schemes. Results indicate significant negative impacts of climate
variability, change, and double exposure on future water resources and
food security. However, some climate assumptions provide opportunity for
some food producers who respond positively to technological adaptation
programs, while consumers could face the major negative consequences by
experiencing higher food prices. Our findings provide policymakers and
stakeholders a comprehensive tool for economically efficient and
sustainably reliant policy design, implementation, and evaluation facing
the potential climate variability and change impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

N2  - This paper presents a spatial multi-agent programming model, which has
been developed for assessing policy options in the diffusion of
innovations and resource use changes. Unlike conventional simulation
tools used in agricultural economics, the model class described here
applies a multi-agent/cellular automata (CA) approach by using
heterogeneous farm-household models and capturing their social and
spatial interactions explicitly. The individual choice of the
farm-household among available production, consumption, investment and
marketing alternatives is represented in recursive linear programming
models. Adoption constraints are introduced in form of network-threshold
values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation
of peers' experiences. The model's economic and hydrologic components
are tightly connected into a spatial framework. The integration of
economic and hydrologic processes facilitates the, consideration of
feedback effects in the use of water for irrigation. The simulation runs
of the model are carried out with an empirical data set, which has been
derived from various data sources on an agricultural region in Chile.
Simulation results show that agent-based spatial modelling constitutes a
powerful approach to better understanding processes of innovation and
resource use change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

N2  - The use of models like HYDRUS in planning irrigation and fertigation scheduling is increasingly researched. Simulation of the root zone processes using HYDRUS largely depends on characterizing parameters related to unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, root growth and water uptake dynamics. A methodology for estimating evapotranspiration parameters for drip irrigated paddy is developed in the present work. The methodology involves soil moisture logging of root zone followed by modelling the dynamics of soil water movement in the root zone by inversely solving the Richards’ equation and evapotranspiration parameters estimation by non-linear programming. All the computer programming was done with MS-EXCEL and it is found that this tool is versatile for this purpose. The results of this work are very useful for using HYDRUS in developing optimal irrigation and fertigation schedule. A threshold level of soil water suction pressure for irrigation scheduling of paddy was also obtained through this work. Temporal changes in the location of the average volumetric water content and average evapotranspiration in the root zone were evaluated. These data are useful for developing guidelines for soil water sensor placement in automatic irrigation triggers.

N1  - Special Issue: Third International Symposium on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM): Towards Sustainable Coasts - “Recent developments and advancements”
N2  - The present paper provides a reflection on threats to integrated management of the Thau coastal lagoon due to climate change and the multi-scalar water scarcity adaptation strategy. This study proposes first to depict the Thau water governance assessed through a water use and social network analysis and its capacity to manage water quality. Next, this paper provides a downscaled study on the climate change impacts on the hydrological budget of the entire Thau catchment in 2041–2070 compared with the 1971–2000 reference period, a methodology developed during the CLIMB EU research program. Following local climate change impacts, the importation of a new water resource to secure water uses is presented in regards to the capacity of local water governance to maintain coherence between integrated land planning and integrated water management planning based on water quality issues of the Thau coastal lagoon. The study underlines that although the water uses are currently secured thanks to the regional transfer of water, they are not coherent with local water management and create new vulnerabilities in the context of climate change. Moreover, the regional decision to end financial support for the more efficient, existing network for the water quality survey of regional coastal lagoons breaks up the local water governance. This paper demonstrates why keeping this network would have been absolutely necessary for encouraging a governance capable of proposing sustainable solutions to water quality challenges induced by climate change.

N1  - Agricultural water and nonpoint source pollution management at a watershed scale Part II Overseen by: Dr. Brent Clothier
N2  - This study investigates multi-dimensional impacts of adopting new technology in agriculture at the farm/village and watershed scale in sub-Saharan Africa using the Integrated Decision Support System (IDSS). Application of IDSS as an integrated modeling tool helps solve complex issues in agricultural systems by simultaneously assessing production, environmental, economic, and nutritional consequences of adopting agricultural technologies for sustainable increases in food production and use of scarce natural resources. The IDSS approach was applied to the Amhara region of Ethiopia, where the scarcity of resources and agro-environmental consequences are critical to agricultural productivity of small farm, to analyze the impacts of alternative agricultural technology interventions. Results show significant improvements in family income and nutrition, achieved through the adoption of irrigation technologies, proper use of fertilizer, and improved seed varieties while preserving environmental indicators in terms of soil erosion and sediment loadings. These pilot studies demonstrate the usefulness of the IDSS approach as a tool that can be used to predict and evaluate the economic and environmental consequences of adopting new agricultural technologies that aim to improve the livelihoods of subsistence farmers.

N2  - The trend of yield losses to drought in United States (U.S.) agriculture has increased over the years, in spite of financial investments and technological development to alleviate drought impacts. As climate change threatens to worsen future drought conditions, it is crucial to evaluate drought impacts on crop production for efficient yet robust decision-making at the regional level. This study evaluated the robustness of modified Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPIs) using effective precipitation (EP) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in assessing drought impacts on county-level maize and soybean yields in the southeastern U.S during 1979–2019. The results showed that the modified SPI using the CROPWAT EP formula can be as effective as SPEI in assessing drought impacts on crop production. Assessment of drought impacts on crop yield year-to-year variability was then assessed by fitting linear regression through the yield-drought time series. Probability of yield loss due to drought in the region was estimated by using a copula-based probabilistic model. Results show that drought events occurring during the critical development growth stage had significantly negative impacts on year-to-year yield variability in over 50% of the counties in the study region, though the impact magnitude varied across the region due to different characteristics, historical climatic condition and irrigation infrastructure. On average, an extremely dry event occurring during the critical development growth stage resulted in a region-wide average yield reduction between − 42.7% and − 31.9% for maize and between − 25.4% and − 23.4% for soybean. Moderately wet conditions may increase crop yield, but excessively wet conditions may diminish the benefits for both crops. The average probability of yield loss of the study region under the extremely dry condition is more than 80%. Irrigation may help to reduce the impacts of drought on crop production: maize-producing irrigated counties on average were found to be 50% less sensitive to drought than non-irrigated counties, though this effect is smaller for soybean. As crop production in the region is highly vulnerable to drought, adaptation interventions under are required to adapt to warming climate scenarios.

N2  - Over 380 000 t of vegetable waste are produced annually in the ``Campo
de Dalias{''} zone (Almeria, South-eastern Spain) from horticultural
crops grown in greenhouses. Landfills containing this vegetable waste
are a potential breeding ground for diseases and pests and a source of
greenhouse gas (methane). Moreover, they may also cause uncontrolled
burning, riverbed blockage, poisoning of animals and produce an
undesirable visual impact on the landscape. The only way to prevent or
minimize this problem is to adopt a comprehensive and environmentally
sensitive waste management programme.
Using the contingent valuation method (CVM), it has been verified that
farmers might be willing to pay more than they do at present for waste
management if the residue was to be re-utilized, and two different uses
have been evaluated: (1) a composting plant and (2) an energy-recycling
process to desalinate sea water for irrigation purposes. The methodology
has allowed a monetary value to be ascribed to the total environmental
benefit.
In addition, a Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used to
locate an optimal area for a composting plant. The solution obtained
takes into account all the environmental restrictions considered and, at
the same time, it minimizes the transportation cost of organic waste
from the production areas to the treatment facility.
The subsequent integration of the results in a generalized cost-benefit
analysis suggests the composting project as the best alternative when
the environmental benefit of recycling vegetable waste was economically
internalized. (C) 2007 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Climate change requires Mediterranean farms to maintain adequate profitability, while adapting to the increase in water needs of crops, the growth of water demand for non-agricultural users and the reduction of resource availability. We use discrete stochastic programming models of three Italian farming areas to simulate the adaptation paths of their farm types to changes in yields and irrigation needs of crops that climate change could generate at 2030. This is done in a context of progressive decrease of water availability. We condense the adaptation choices attributed by the optimization process to the farm types by means of indicators of value produced per water cubic meter and per hectare. We use those indicators in a quadratic regression analysis to explain the change in the hourly wages of family labour, which represents the farm resources’ profitability. The examination of the resulting elasticity indices outlines the adaptation paths impact on farm profitability. This integrated analysis of optimization models and econometric regression shows that the core of Italian cow milk production, based on medium-high intensity forage systems, adapts better. Instead, available technologies and structural features provide much narrower margins to livestock farms based on intensive forage production and, conversely, to more extensive livestock systems. Crop farms adapt by reducing labour use in less profitable activities, which boosts family hourly wages but increases unemployment. Furthermore, the surface of some crops can be expanded because their cycle takes place in months in which the availability of water decreases less and their irrigation requirement increases less; however, the low productivity of these crops does not allow to increase wages for family labour. The results on farms overall profitability derive from an integrated analysis of changes in water resources productivity, soil and labor. Mathematical programming outlines the adaptation paths that maximize farming incomes; the econometric analysis indicates whether those paths support profitability, favouring farm economic sustainability.

N2  - Organic and microbial contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), even though not yet regulated, are of great concern in reclaimed water reuse projects. Due to the large number of CECs and their different characteristics, it is useful to include only a limited number of them in monitoring programs. The selection of the most representative CECs is still a current and open question. This study presents a new methodology for this scope, in particular for the evaluation of the performance of a polishing treatment and the assessment of the risk for the environment and the irrigated crops. As to organic CECs, the methodology is based on four criteria (occurrence, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity) expressed in terms of surrogates (respectively, concentrations in the secondary effluent, removal achieved in conventional activated sludge systems, Log Kow and predicted-no-effect concentration). It consists of: (i) development of a dataset including the CECs found in the secondary effluent, together with the corresponding values of surrogates found in the literature or by in-field investigations; (ii) normalization step with the assignment of a score between 1 (low environmental impact) and 5 (high environmental impact) to the different criteria based on threshold values set according to the literature and experts' judgement; (iii) CEC ranking according to their final score obtained as the sum of the specific scores; and (iv) selection of the representative CECs for the different needs. Regarding microbial CECs, the selection is based on their occurrence and their highest detection frequency in the secondary effluent and in the receiving water, the antibiotic consumption patterns, and recommendations by national and international organisations. The methodology was applied within the ongoing reuse project SERPIC resulting in a list of 30 indicator CECs, including amoxicillin, bisphenol A, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, erythromycin, ibuprofen, iopromide, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, Escherichia coli, faecal coliform, 16S rRNA, sul1, and sul2.

N2  - Irrigation is of great importance to sesame production in Mediterranean-type environments due to positive effect on flower and capsule numbers. Water stress limits sesame growth and development. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different irrigation programs on flower and capsule numbers, shedding percentage, and yield of sesame. The amount of water used was based on free surface evaporation from a screened class-A pan. Irrigation treatments consisted of three different irrigation intervals (I1: 7-day; I2: 14-day; I3: 21-day), four plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.60; Kcp2: 0.80; Kcp3: 1.00 and Kcp4: 1.20). The first irrigation was carried out when the available water was at 40% level in the 90cm of the soil profile. The results revealed significant linear relationships among the irrigation water, water consumption and total number of flower per plant. On the other hand, the highest total number of flower per plant and the highest shedding percentage were obtained from 7-day intervals. Irrigation interval–irrigation amount interaction was significant for the number of sound capsule per plant. The highest number of sound capsule was obtained from Kcp3 treatment at I1 irrigation interval. Therefore, sesame yield increased by increasing the capsule number.

N2  - Silicon (Si) can have several beneficial effects when exogenously applied to plants, including increased tolerance against several abiotic and biotic stressors. The current study investigated the role of nanosized, monodisperse silicon particles in alleviating the harmful impact of excess sodium chloride (NaCl) on ‘Valencia’ sweet orange. One-year-old ‘Valencia’ (Citrus x sinensis L. Osbeck) plants budded onto Kuharske (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck x Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) rootstock were irrigated with 0, 60 or 120 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) solution for six months. We observed an incremental reduction in plant growth with increased NaCl application. Severe foliar drop and damage were observed following 60 and 120 mM NaCl application. Silicon nanoparticles applied by direct foliar application at four concentrations (0, 200, 400 and 600 mM) to these stressed plants reduced the damage in the greenhouse. Additionally, SiO2-NP application improved root growth, increased chlorophyll content, and alleviated the osmotic effect on all NaCl-treated plants compared to the control stressed plants. Furthermore, expression of Na+ cotransporter (CsSOS1, CsSOS2, CsSOS3 and CsNHX1) and aquaporin (CsPIP1;1, CsPIP2;3, and CsTIP4;1) transcripts was enhanced in the root tissues following SiO2-NP application. These results support the positive effect of exogenous Si application at 400 mM on salt-stressed citrus plants by improving photosynthesis, water status and regulating ion content. Consequently, SiO2-NPs can be applied as part of an integrated management program to improve overall citrus plant health, especially under stressful saline conditions.

N2  - Establishing farmland protection areas is an important measure for developing countries to protect limited farmland resources and guarantee food security. The general approaches lack the ability to simulate the farmlands’ production potential under different scenarios. This paper proposes a modified farmland protection zoning framework to demarcate farmland protection by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model with a state-of-the-art farmland protection zoning framework. The modified zoning framework was applied to China, a typical fast developing country. The results indicated that the average potential production of the entire country would increase by 2.96 % in the coming decade if the irrigation efficiency criteria of 55 % established by the National Program for Agricultural Water Conservation (2012–2020) can be fulfilled. Furthermore, the farmland protection area could also be reduced by 2.91 % (2.96 million ha) while the total production potential of the protected areas would remain unchanged. This study contributes two main aspects: (1) The AEZ model was used as a replacement for the general land-use suitability analysis (LUSA) or multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based farmland assessment models in a farmland zoning framework, which can accurately assess the production potential of the farmland protection demarcation. (2) This farmland protection zoning approach can analyze and simulate a wide range of scenarios on the effect of environmental factors (climate, soil, terrain, etc.) and human production factors (irrigation condition, cropping system, etc.).

N2  - There is growing concern over the impacts of cannabis farms on the environment and water resources in particular, yet data on cultivation practices and water use patterns have been limited. Estimates of water use for cannabis cultivation have previously relied on extrapolated values of plant water demand, which do not account for differences in cultivation practices, variation across the growing season, or the role of water storage in altering seasonal extraction patterns. The current study uses data reported by enrollees in California's North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board Cannabis Program to model how variation in cultivation practices and the use of stored water affect the timing and amount of water extracted from the environment. We found that the supplemental use of stored water resulted in a seasonal pattern of water extraction (water withdrawals from the environment) that was distinct from water demand (water applied to plants). Although water input to storage in the off-season months (November through March) reduced water extraction in the growing season (April through October), farms generally did not have sufficient storage to completely forbear from surface water extraction during the growing season. The most important predictors of storage sufficiency were type of storage infrastructure, type of water source, and farm size, with the likelihood of sufficiency decreasing with increasing cultivation area. As of 2019, state cannabis regulations require forbearance from surface water diversions from April through October. To comply, farms relying on surface water must either develop storage, reduce water demand, or seek alternative water sources, such as groundwater. Our findings indicate that water extraction from farms using groundwater wells generally occurs during the summer dry season and highlight the need to assess their potential impacts to connected surface water in streams. Finally, given that the current study was based on data exclusively from permitted cannabis farms, additional data from unpermitted operations would enhance our overall understanding of cannabis water-use practices and consequences for the environment.

N2  - Wildlife intrusion has been associated with pathogen contamination of produce. However, few studies have examined pathogen transfer from wildlife feces to pre-harvest produce. This study was performed to calculate transfer coefficients for Escherichia coli from simulated wildlife feces to field-grown lettuce during irrigation. Rabbit feces inoculated with a 3-strain cocktail of non-pathogenic E. coli were placed in a lettuce field 2.5–72 h before irrigation. Following irrigation, the E. coli concentration on the lettuce was determined. After exclusion of an outlier with high E. coli levels (Most Probable Number = 5.94*108), the average percent of E. coli in the feces that transferred to intact lettuce heads was 0.0267% (Standard Error [SE] = 0.0172). Log-linear regression showed that significantly more E. coli transferred to outer leaves compared to inner leaves (Effect = 1.3; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.4, 2.1). Additionally, the percent of E. coli that transferred from the feces to the lettuce decreased significantly with time after fecal placement, and as the distance between the lettuce and the feces, and the lettuce and the sprinklers increased. These findings provide key data that may be used in future quantitative risk assessments to identify potential intervention strategies for reducing food safety risks associated with fresh produce.

N2  - Short duration spring wheat cultivars are currently preferred for irrigated wheat production in subtropical Australia due to their high levels of lodging resistance. A study was conducted to determine whether recently developed lodging-resistant long duration cultivars could achieve increased grain yield compared to short duration cultivars in irrigated sub-tropical environments. A key aspect of the study methodology required the use of different sowing dates for each maturity group to ensure anthesis was synchronised and thus occurred during the same climatic conditions. Growth of representative cultivars in each experiment was simulated using the APSIM model to characterise each environment for the presence of water or nitrogen stress. Results of the study indicated that the long duration cultivars had an increased grain yield of 0.67 t ha−1 (9.6%) on average across the 14 agro-climatic environments compared to the short duration cultivars. The response varied between agro-climatic environments, with long duration cultivars significantly higher yielding in 70% (or ten) of the environments, no significant difference observed in three environments, and a significantly lower yield associated with long duration cultivars in one environment. The yield advantage of the long duration cultivars was greater in environments where moderate water stress was experienced, with yield differences of up to 1.5 t ha−1 observed in the most water-stressed environments. The yield advantage was less apparent in environments where low levels of water stress were experienced, and in two environments where lodging was more severe among the long duration cultivars. The relatively small difference in duration between the long and short duration cultivars in this study may not have fully exploited the potential benefits of longer duration cultivars. The results suggest that genetic improvement programs should continue to develop longer season germplasm that conveys an adaptive advantage to irrigated sub-tropical environments such as Australia, India and Mexico that experience short-term water deficits, and in which deficit irrigation is often the most profitable strategy for farmers. Additional research is necessary to determine whether ultra-long duration cultivars could further raise yield potential in sub-tropical environments if lodging could be avoided, through either genetic improvement or improved access to plant growth regulators.

N2  - Agriculture dominates California's San Joaquin Valley with over five million acres of farmland produces 400 different commodities ranging from nuts, tree fruits, vines, and row crops. During dry years agricultural production in the San Joaquin Valley uses about 53% of total applied water in the state. Implementation of California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) will restrict groundwater pumping, likely reducing irrigated agricultural land use resulting in conversion to alternative land uses. To promote collaborative and inclusive efforts to repurpose agricultural land, California's legislature established a funding program administered by the Department of Conservation, the Multibenefit Land Repurposing Program (MLRP), in 2021. To ensure that land repurposing plans under the MLRP and SGMA represent San Joaquin Valley community needs this paper examines public perceptions of future land uses under SGMA through a phone survey. Respondents (n = 197) were recruited through a stratified random sample of mobile numbers registered within communities in the San Joaquin Valley classified as disadvantaged communities (DACs) (n = 32). Our results show that most respondents were somewhat (33%) or not at all (54%) familiar with SGMA, highlighting the need for outreach efforts to overcome barriers to representation, translation, and education about future water and land use decisions. Survey respondents identified secure water supplies (e.g., groundwater recharge) (35%) and less-water intensive agriculture (27%) as their top land use priorities to address groundwater overdraft under SGMA, indicating that the status quo for land use is preferred to alternative land uses. Preference for maintaining agriculture as primary land use (27%), we correlated with agricultural identity and lack of interest in community or global benefits such as schools and climate change mitigation. The findings from this study underscore the local variability in land use values and the importance to engaging local communities in land use decision-making, especially as they relate to changing current practices toward a more climate-resilient but agriculturally productive future with less land and less water.

N2  - Extreme heat represents a growing threat to public health, especially across the densely populated, developed landscape of cities. Climate adaptation strategies that aim to manage urban microclimates through purposeful design can reduce the heat exposure of urban populations, however, it is unclear how the temperature impacts of urban green space and albedo vary across cities and background climate. This study quantifies the sensitivity of surface temperature to landcover characteristics tied to two widely used climate adaptation strategies, urban greening and albedo manipulation (e.g. white roofs), by combining long-term remote sensing observations of land surface temperature, albedo, and moisture with high-resolution landcover datasets in a spatial regression analysis at the census block scale across seven United States cities. We find tree cover to have an average cooling impact of −0.089 K per % cover, which is approximately four times stronger than the average grass cover cooling impact of −0.021 K per % cover. Variability in the magnitude of grass cover cooling impacts was primarily a function of vegetation moisture content, with the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) explaining 89 % of the variability in grass cover cooling impacts across cities. Variability in tree cover cooling impacts was primarily a function of sunlight and vegetation moisture content, with solar irradiance and LSWI explaining 97 % of the cooling variability across cities. Albedo cooling impacts were consistent across cities with an average cooling impact of −0.187 K per increase of 0.01. While these interventions are broadly effective across cities, there are critical regional trade-offs between vegetation cooling efficiency, irrigation requirements, and the temporal duration and evolution of the cooling benefits. In warm, arid cities, high albedo surfaces offer multifaceted benefits such as cooling and water conservation, whereas temperate, mesic cities likely benefit from a combination of strategies, with greening efforts targeting highly paved neighborhoods.

N2  - Rapidly increasing population, industrialisation, and unsustainable consumption have resulted in deterioration of water quantity and quality, thus affecting the health of the river. One of the essential components for ensuring river health is environmental flow. Nevertheless, the environmental flow is neglected or not appropriately accounted in most of the water management assessments. The objective of this study was to better quantify and assess the environmental flow requirements and developing management practices for ensuring the ecological health of the river. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) coupled with a finite element groundwater model, was used for hydrological modelling. The environmental flow regime was evaluated using an index 'Flow Health Score' (FHS), based on a Flow Health Tool. The model was simulated for three conditions – Virgin condition, Managed condition, and Modified condition for Upper and Lower Son separately. Virgin condition assumed no hydraulic interventions, while managed condition incorporated the existing management practices, and modified condition corresponded to the management practices modified in this study for ensuring environmental flow. This approach was demonstrated for the Son River in the Ganga basin. The modelled streamflow agreed with the observed discharge data (R2 = 0.78–0.85). Further, SWAT-FEM coupled model better estimated the low flows than the SWAT model, thus demonstrating the importance of accounting for surface water – groundwater interaction in such environmental flow assessments. Flow health assessment indicated that reservoirs and irrigation diversions have severely affected the high flows in the Upper Son (high flow and highest monthly flow index less than 0.2), and low flows in the Lower Son (low flow index less than 0.2). The model simulation with the modified management practices increased the Flow Health Score (FHS) from 0.4 to 0.6 in Upper Son, and 0.4 to 0.7 in Lower Son. This study showed that coupled SWAT-FEM model, along with the flow health tool, could be effectively used for assessing the in-stream flow requirements and for designing alternative management plans to meet the in-stream flow requirements.

N2  - Compliance with many agri-environmental programs fails to meet expectations due to enforcement difficulties. One response has been devolution of enforcement rights and responsibilities to industry organisations. This kind of response is based on a belief that farmers cooperate more with their industry organisations than with government in ensuring compliance, both in terms of sanctioning one another's compliance and supporting their organisations in providing third-party sanctioning. A case study involving complementary use of qualitative and quantitative research methods was undertaken to assess this belief. The case involves farmers in the central-Murray region of New South Wales in Australia faced with potentially worsening problems of irrigation salinity and waterlogging. Their jointly owned irrigation company has been devolved responsibility for enforcing implementation of collective action plans the farmers have developed and agreed to carry out. The case study revealed inter alia that the farmers are more prepared to support sanctioning from their company than they would be from government, but that—at least at this early stage of the implementation process—they remain reluctant to directly punish one another's non-compliance through peer pressure or other informal mechanisms.

N2  - Increasing scarcity of water resources in many regions is likely to give rise to disputes similar to those observed in the Klamath region of Oregon and California where irrigation water buyback programs have been implemented to reduce irrigation diversions with the purpose of securing required instream flow for aquatic habitat. In this study using a mathematical programming approach we compare a direct water buyback program with an indirect, land idling based, program for securing required amount of water. We show that land idling based programs can be costlier than direct water buyback programs. Compensation for water idling directly, unlike land idling based programs, ensures that marginal water units with the lowest derived demand values are removed from production first. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - More than 11 million ha of olives (Olea europaea L.) are currently grown worldwide, 98% of which are localized in the Mediterranean Basin, with olives being one of the most important fruit trees in the area. The olive fruit is a very particular drupe since it not may be directly consumed but must instead be processed. Table olives and virgin olive oil are the two main processed products derived from olive fruits. Both are considered staple foods of the Mediterranean Diet and have been produced in the area for centuries, presumably since olive domestication occurred approximately 6.000 years ago. Despite their long history and economic importance, the focus on quality is quite recent. The presence of various and copious amounts of bioactive compounds, some of which are exclusive to olives, is drawing attention to the nutraceutical value of these products. This review aims to integrate the available information regarding the quality of table olives and olive oil with a focus on how preharvest factors may affect quality. The first part of the review describes the main quality attributes considered for each product from different perspectives, including the legal, organoleptic and nutritional points of view, among others. The physiological mechanisms involved in fruit development and ripening, which significantly affect the quality of the fruits, i.e., the raw material for obtaining both products, are also discussed. The review also addresses the potential of both the considerable number of traditional olive cultivars and recent olive breeding programs to obtain products with distinct quality attributes (in terms of sensorial profile and bioactive compounds). Finally, the most recent literature concerning the effect of environmental (soil and climate) and agronomical factors (irrigation, fertilization, canopy management and harvesting) is extensively reviewed.

N1  - Approaches to improve the utilization of food-feed crops
N2  - The mixed crop–livestock systems of India are underpinned by the crop residues which contribute on an average 40–60% of the total dry matter intake per livestock unit. There is however considerable regional variation in the dominant type of crop residue: rice and wheat straws in irrigated regions compared to coarse cereal straws and hay from leguminous crops in the drier, semi-arid regions. This paper synthesizes a series of recent studies on the role and importance of crop residues and farmers’ perceptions of fodder quantity and quality in coarse cereal and groundnut based feeding systems. Crop improvement programs for sorghum, pearl millet and groundnut have traditionally focused on grain/pod yield improvement, pest and water stress tolerance. Only relatively recently have dual-purpose (grain and fodder) plant types been developed. While the nutritive value of fodder from dual-purpose crops can be determined through in vivo and in vitro analysis, such experimental procedures cannot necessarily capture the often-subjective quality attributes that farmers (and their animals) value. Results indicate that farmers perceive a range of quality traits, some of which could be screened for relatively easily, whereas others may be more difficult to assess. These findings highlight the importance of farmer participatory evaluation of fodder traits in the development of improved dual-purpose varieties. However the impact of these varieties on poor farm households will be contingent on the complementary improvement in the effectiveness of seed systems.

N2  - Government subsidies for agricultural activities in recent decades have encouraged farmers of Hamadan-Bahar plain to extend the number of wells and irrigated farms, with no consideration of groundwater resource conservation. As a result, the level of the groundwater table has decreased continuously in this area, threatening the life of groundwater aquifer. The objective of the study is to analyze the impacts of irrigation water pricing and agricultural policy scenarios on aquifer conservation by considering the dynamic relations between aquifer groundwater balance and the agriculture sector. For this purpose a combination of simulation and optimization techniques is considered in a dynamic framework. Firstly, dynamic treatments of groundwater and the main factors affecting the balance of studied aquifer are simulated. Then, optimization behaviour of agriculture sector related to farmers' decision-making processes is defined on the time horizon. Thereafter all of the equations are used simultaneously by a non-linear dynamic programming method, which maximize present value of gross margins of agriculture sector subject to groundwater constrains and other input limitations. The analysis of the results indicates that water pricing by itself can considerably reduce the agricultural demand for aquifer groundwater in the Hamadan-Bahar plain.

N1  - Putting Science into Practice
N2  - Irrigation water quality is an essential component of sustainable agriculture. Irrigation water quality concerns have often been neglected over concerns of quantity in most irrigation projects in Malawi. In this study, a hydrochemical assessment of groundwater was carried out to characterize, classify groundwater and evaluate its suitability for irrigation use in Karonga and Rumphi districts, Northern Malawi. Groundwater samples were collected during wet (January–April 2011) and dry (July–September 2011) seasons from 107 shallow wells and boreholes drilled for rural water supply using standard sampling procedures. The water samples were analysed for pH, major ions, total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity (EC), using standard methods. Multivariate chemometric (such as Kruskal Wallis test), hydrographical methods (i.e. Piper diagram) and PHREEQC geochemical modelling program were used to characterise the groundwater quality. Electrical conductivity, percentage sodium ion (% Na+), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), Kelly’s ratio (KR) and permeability index (PI) were used to evaluate the suitability of water for irrigation. It was established that groundwater is neutral to alkaline and mostly freshwater (TDS<1000mg/l) of Ca-HCO3- type. Groundwater is of low mineralisation which did not show statistically significant variations with respect to depth of shallow wells and boreholes, location and seasonality at 5% significance level. Groundwater from Karonga District was largely oversaturated with respect to both calcite and dolomite, where as that from Rumphi District was undersaturated with respect to both calcite and dolomite. However, the calculated PCO2 values suggested that the groundwater system was open to soil CO2 and that there was possibility of degassing of CO2 during flow, which could increase the pH and subsequently result in the oversaturation of calcite in both districts. Groundwater water samples were stable towards calcite and kaolinite stability field. This suggested that equilibrium of the groundwater with silicates is an important indicator of the hydrogeochemical processes behind groundwater quality in the study area. The calculated values of SAR, KR and % Na+ indicated good and permissible quality of water for irrigation uses. However, samples with doubtful RSC (6% from Karonga district), unsuitable PI (5% and 3% from Karonga and Rumphi, respectively) and a high salinity hazard (56.2% and 20.3% from Karonga and Rumphi, respectively) values restrict the suitability of the groundwater for agricultural purposes, and plants with good salt tolerance should be selected for such groundwaters. A detailed hydro-geochemical investigation and integrated water management is suggested for sustainable development of the water resources for better plant growth, long-term as well as maintaining human health in the study area.

N2  - Private on-farm investment has been lacking by smallholders in Indian agriculture. This study explores the efficiency of alternative public expenditures to support Indian agriculture and encourage private on-farm investment. Specifically, the paper examines the crowding-in effect of input subsidies and other forms of public investments on private on-farm investment. The study uses an autoregressive distributive lag model and data from 1980 to 2018. Findings reveal that irrigation subsidy strongly induces private on-farm investment over the long-run and short-run. However, public expenditures on research, education, and the area served by public canals have a significant crowding-in effect on private on-farm investment over the short and long run. Other factors that stimulate private investment in Indian agriculture include institutional credit, favorable agricultural terms of trade, and future demand for food. Thus, policymakers should better target and rationalize public expenditures programs. Policy recommendations include removing unproductive input subsidies (such as fertilizer and power subsidies) and diverting the freed resources toward public investment in Indian agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - India is the seventh-largest country in the world, covering an area of 3.29 millionkm2, which is only 2.4% of the world's land area, sustaining ~8% of the world's biodiversity. Owing to its unique geography, landscape, and rainfall pattern, the Indian subcontinent experiences dual problems related to water: severe droughts and flooding simultaneously in different parts of the country. In order to obviate this irony, linking glacier-monsoon fed perennial rivers of the north with seasonal rivers of the south has been proposed. On completion, the mammoth program of interlinking of rivers (ILR) will be the world's largest irrigation infrastructure project, linking 37 rivers through 30 links by establishing about 15,000km of new canals and 3000 dams of various sizes. Because each river basin acts as a holistic system in tune with the climatic, geological, and anthropogenic interactions, any study on the river system should understand the dynamics of the river basin as a whole. A river basin is a basic geographic and climatological unit within which the vagaries of natural processes act and manifest at different spatio-temporal scales. However, even if juxtaposed, no two river basins respond to natural processes in a similar way, and thus, each river basin is unique. Hence, any developmental activity or conservation effort has to be designed and implemented unique to each river basin. At this juncture, linking the diverse river systems that are distinct in terms of climate, geomorphology, geology, structure, land use, source of water, monsoon systems, biodiversity, human populace, and so forth as envisaged in the ILR stands unprecedented in terms of type, and magnitude. If so, the program poses severe constraints on the assessment of probable environmental, ecological, and other feedback, and strategizing remedial and reclamation measures. Recognizing this, we explore the interlinked nature of river systems and coastal stability, and probable impacts, and suggest necessary mitigation measures with reference to the proposed ILR. Preparation of natural environmental baseline data, based on which formulation of a masterplan within which subplans unique for each river basin and establishment of monitoring system on a short-medium-long term basis are suggested for effective implementation of the river linking and sustainable development.

N2  - The main objective of this paper is to estimate the willingness of farmers to pay for groundwater resources under different conditions of water supply regimes. Information available on water supplies, areas under irrigation and market conditions were the basis of the calculations. In order to identify solutions that maximize the total net income subject to resource restraints, parametric linear programming models were used to derive farmers’ willingness to pay for irrigation water. Results showed that there is potential to decrease water consumption and to reallocate it in an optimal way. Optimal reallocation increased the net agricultural income in the study area. The water demand for agriculture reacts to increasing water prices in a quite elastic manner over a long interval, whereas it reacts inelastic in the case of a decrease of the overall water supply by 15%. Farmers are willing to pay two and a half times the prevailing price of groundwater. The results show that the water values in the region are underestimated and the decision makers can impose a price level for groundwater from US$ 0.14 to 0.35/m3 without having any impact on the cropping pattern or the planted area.

N2  - A critical step in water management policy development is the analysis of its socio-economic and environmental implications. However, few methods could proactively and reliably predict and assess the impacts of policies while handling the inherent uncertainty. To fill such a gap, an inexact simulation-evaluation method was developed for analyzing the impacts of multiple water management policies under uncertainty. The interval positive mathematical programming (IPMP) method was proposed as the simulation tool by coupling interval programming with positive mathematical programming (PMP). The evaluation tool was developed by combining the interval TOPSIS method and the interval maximum deviation method. This simulation-evaluation method can directly communicate a policy's simulation outcomes into the evaluation process while addressing the uncertainties in both simulation and evaluation. The proposed method can also reproduce the actual situation with a calibration process, which enables accurate and smooth responses to policy changes. This approach was used for agricultural water management in arid north-west China. Seventy-five policy alternatives generated from three groundwater allocation limits and twenty-five differential water pricing levels were investigated. The impacts of these alternatives on farmer income, farmer employment, water consumption, planting areas, and fertilizer use were simulated using IPMP. Twenty-four non-inferior alternatives were selected and further evaluated with multi-dimensional criteria. The final results showed that, the water price for grain crops with traditional irrigation methods should rise by 60%, those for cash crops with drip irrigation should decrease by 60%, and the groundwater quota should be reduced by 20%. Compared with traditional models, IPMP can increase simulation accuracy by reproducing observed situations, enhance robustness by reflecting input uncertainty, and improve flexibility in decision-making by providing interval solutions. The inexact simulation-evaluation model can also be widely used to analyze other policies.

N2  - Saline soils are a major challenge in the cropping region of Inner Mongolia, China. Crop modelling might be a useful tool for identifying suitable management practices for sunflower, which is the main crop in this area. To evaluate the applicability of the sunflower model within the Agricultural Production System siMulator (APSIM) for saline soils, the model was calibrated using one year of field trial data and tested with another year of data collected at the Yichang Experimental Station in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. The treatments employed in the trials included different salinity levels and nitrogen application rates. The crop characteristics assessed included the seed yield (SY), dry matter (DM), and leaf area index (LAI) at various growth stages of the sunflowers. To represent salinity effects in the model, i.e., reduced water uptake by the plants, we tested three options by modifying the crop lower limit (CLL), the water-extraction coefficient (KL), and the pattern of root exploration in the soil profile (XF). We optimized each parameter individually against measured SY, DM, and LAI values using a multi-objective calibration in the PEST program with data collected from a field trial that was conducted in 2012. The results indicated that by modifying CLL, KL, and XF in the SoilWater module of APSIM, sunflower SY and DM could be simulated for saline soils, and modifying KL afforded the most accurate SY simulation (R2=0.99, RMSE=253.51kgha−1, RRMSE=7.11%). Additionally, the scale factors used to modify CLL, KL, and XF (noted as SCLL, SKL, and SXF, respectively) according to the referenced CLL, KL, and XF values could be estimated based on the 0–20-cm soil salinity level before sowing (S). Specifically, SCLL increased linearly with S (SCLLS model, R2=0.80), and SKL and SXF decreased linearly with the natural logarithm of S (SKLS and SXFS models, R2=0.74 and 0.67, respectively). When using measured data from 2014 for the evaluation, the SKLS and SXFS models achieved high accuracy for the SY simulations (R2=0.71 and 0.71; RMSE=568.7 and 845.5kgha−1, RRMSE=17.03% and 25.32%, respectively) and acceptable accuracy for the DM simulations (R2=0.41 and 0.45; RMSE=2543.2 and 3114.5kgha−1, RRMSE=20.99% and 25.70%, respectively), although the SCLLS model slightly underestimated SY and DM. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism linking CLL, KL, XF, crop physiological parameters (e.g., radiation use efficiency), and soil salinity by testing the approaches at additional sites; such efforts would improve the accuracy of sunflower growth modelling in salinized areas.

N2  - Global water resources are under increasing pressure, and some regions face the need to retire irrigation due to groundwater depletion or to meet governmental regulations. In arid and semiarid climates, irrigated lands tend to have more soil organic carbon (SOC) than non-irrigated croplands. However, little is known about how SOC might change following irrigation retirement. Our objective was to quantify changes in SOC and nitrogen stocks after irrigation retirement in semiarid agroecosystems of the High Plains. We sampled fields that stopped using irrigation and transitioned into either dryland crops or ungrazed perennial grasslands and compared SOC and nitrogen stocks in these fields with still irrigated and long-term dryland situations. Currently irrigated fields had more SOC (83.0 vs 73.3 Mg ha-1) and nitrogen (10.2 vs 9.4 Mg ha-1) at 0–80 cm depth than their dryland counterparts, confirming the reported positive impact of irrigation in semiarid agroecosystems. However, there was no legacy effect of irrigation on SOC and nitrogen topsoil stocks 7–10 years after transition to dryland crops as retired fields had lower stocks than still irrigated fields and did not differ from long-term dryland cropping zones of the same fields. This lack of a legacy effect was related to the preferential accumulation, during irrigation, of carbon and nitrogen in the less stable particulate organic matter pool at 0–10 cm soil depth. The transition from irrigated agriculture to perennial grasses resulted in intermediate SOC stocks, that did not differ from the still irrigated nor from the sites retired to dryland crops. Our results suggest that perennial systems are a viable option to mitigate, at least partially, the negative impact of irrigation retirement on SOC. However, the advantage of perennial grasses was explained by the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in the particulate organic matter fraction, which poses some questions about the stability of SOC in these systems after changes in management.

N2  - This study analysed the vulnerabilities and coping capacities of rural women to drought in Zvishavane district in Zimbabwe. The study utilised quantitative research approach in which a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the sampled households. The result revealed that low and erratic rainfall, lack of alternative livelihood options, lack of land and property ownership amongst others were identified as some of the indicators of vulnerability among rural women in Zvishavane. Despite the vulnerabilities surrounding them, rural women are not passive victims of drought. They have developed and adopted drought coping strategies such as; purchasing food stuffs from neighbouring communities and stocking it for consumption in dry periods, selling or trading their small livestock for grain, cultivation of drought resistant crop varieties, skipping meals and reducing meal portions and initiation of market gardens to supplement their harvests. Various institutions such as Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), the government and religious organisations are also providing necessary support to these women. In order to mitigate drought impacts on rural women, interventions such as; boosting of irrigation activities, inclusion of women in programme implementation and drought mitigation planning, diversification of livelihoods, establishment and promotion of drought buffers and social networks are needed. In addition, reforms aimed at correcting the imbalances in land ownership and rectification of gender discrimination and imbalances from past practices and policies are some of the important policy options that should be looked into.

N2  - For optimal water and fertilizer management under furrow irrigation, it is important to understand the water and solute dynamics on the land surface and in the subsurface. An efficient mathematical tool is required to describe these dynamic processes. We propose a coupled model in which surface water flow and solute transport are described using the zero-inertia equation and the average cross-sectional convection-dispersion equation, respectively, while the two-dimensional Richards equation and the convection-dispersion equation are used to simulate water flow and solute transport in soils, respectively. Solutions are computed numerically using finite differences for surface water flow and finite volumes for solute transports in furrow. Subsurface water flow and solute transport equations are solved using the CHAIN_2D code. An iterative method is used to couple computations of surface and subsurface processes. Both surface and subsurface water flow and solute transport modules are coded in program subroutines and functions in the Intel FORTRAN environment. The coupled model was validated by comparing its simulation results with measured data. Results showed that simulated water front advances in the furrow and water contents in the soil agreed with the observations reasonably well. Good simulations can be achieved with a relatively fine temporal resolution. Numerical oscillations can be eliminated by adopting appropriate time steps. As compared with the traditional furrow irrigation model, the proposed model can better quantify soil water and solute dynamics by considering interactions between surface and subsurface water flow and solute transport processes. The proposed model can be used as a decision tool to design and manage furrow irrigation.

N2  - Vicious competition for limited water resources hinders the synergetic and sustainable development of Central Asian countries, which further threatens food security and exacerbates ecological degradation. In this study, a copula-based bi-level decentralized programming (CBDP) method is developed and applied to planning water-food-ecology (WFE) nexus system. CBDP has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels, analyzing synergies among multiple managers and reflecting joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters. Then, a CBDP-WFE model is formulated for Central Asia, where the upper-level model aims to maximize system benefit for the region (i.e. regional-scale), and the lower-level model involves five objectives to maximize five countries’ benefits (i.e. national-scale) respectively. Totally 108 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of joint constraint-violation risk, agricultural irrigation efficiency, and ecological water demand. Results reveal that (i) improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can optimize the water allocation pattern as well as increase the system benefit; (ii) in order to restore the regional eco-environment, the proportion of ecological water allocation should increase from 7% (of the current level) to 14.9–23.8% (by 2050); (iii) water allocations to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan should be properly controlled especially when available water is scarce. The results are helpful for managers in not only making decisions of water allocation among multiple users and countries but also gaining insight into synergetic management of WFE nexus under various system conditions.

N2  - Agricultural water scarcity is a global problem and effective management of limited water resources for irrigation to meet socioeconomic demands for sustainable development is a huge challenge. A stochastic multi-objective non-linear programming (SMONLP) model is developed for the identification of sound irrigation water allocation schemes. The SMONLP model improves upon previous methods by tackling contradictions of society-economy-resources as well as reflecting uncertainty expressed as probability distributions in an agricultural irrigation system. The SMONLP model permits in-depth analyses of various water allocation policies that are associated with different levels of water supply and climate change. The developed SMONLP model is applied to optimal irrigation allocation in a semi-arid river basin in China. Results reveal that the model coordinates the regulation of interactions of society-economy-resources by balancing the targets of water productivity, allocation equity, profit, economic benefit risk, blue water utilization, and leakage loss. Moreover, surface water availability associated with different violation risk probabilities can lead to the changes in comprehensive benefit of society-economy-resources and irrigation shortages. Nearly each of the 17 irrigation regions suffers from water deficit, because water is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of crops, however, the degree of water shortage is gradually weakened when flow level ranges from low to high. The coordination degree is also used to evaluate the sustainability of water allocation and the results of comparison show that the irrigation water allocation under RCP 4.5 presents lower coordination of society-economy-resources which are mainly attributed to the aggravated contradiction between water supply and demand. A real world study demonstrates the practicability of the developed model, allowing the river basin authorities to determine irrigation water allocation strategies in a changing environment, thus promoting sustainable development of agricultural irrigation systems.

N2  - Diffuse water pollution is a major problem in many agroecosystems, especially in irrigated areas linked to ecosystems of high ecological value. Pollution abatement policies imply the modification of agricultural measures and are usually rejected by farmers because of their impact on farm profitability. This paper aims to design an assessment procedure for an implementation programme of agricultural measures aimed at mitigating diffuse pollution, by combining relative effectiveness across measures with the perceived and real cost of the measures. Measures proposed by a law intended to mitigate diffuse pollution and thereby the degradation of the Mar Menor lagoon, a unique natural space in the southeast of Spain, have been used as a case study. The real cost was obtained from the market, and the perceived cost of the measures was obtained from a representative sample of the farmers involved. This work has allowed comparative real and perceived evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed measures to prioritise them and to reduce information bias, aimed to favours measures adoption. Results show that banning crops less than 100 m from the coast is the most cost-effective measure, followed by the adoption of a nitrate reduction system in desalinated effluent. Divergences between real and perceived cost-effectiveness indicates that good agricultural practices code adoption would require specific actions to reduce these subjective gap. Finally, increasing the acceptability of the policy would imply translating to the farmers information required to reduce the gap between real and perceived cost of the specific agricultural measures.

N2  - The influence of underground coal mining activities has become a leading issue in contaminating water resources as well as depleting the water layer around the mining area. The studied mining area is a plain land which is predominantly used for irrigation purposes where underground water is the main source of water for irrigation. In the case of Barapukuria Coal Mine (BCM), a huge volume of water is pumped regularly from the underground roadway to the surface. Thus, this study takes account of the estimated quantity and quality of water used for irrigation and other uses. Therefore, this study monitored and assessed the quantity and quality of inflow water in the roadway for 13 years. The observation shows that the inflow water volume was about 11,183.52m3/day in 2001, and it has increased up to 43,396.80m3/day in 2013. These results implied that the increment of inflow water intensities is very high with increasing the mining operation. As a result, it might be a considerable problem to deplete the natural water table, which could change the changing aquifer geometry and influence the safe extraction of coal in future. The qualitative assessment of water shows that the underground roadway water is suitable for irrigation purposes. The overall quality of water is largely controlled by rock weathering and evaporation natural processes in the area. In fact, the suitability of roadway water for irrigation was evaluated based on SSP, salinity hazard, sodium percent, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, US salinity diagram, Wilcox's diagram, Kelly's ratio, permeability index, Magnesium Hardness, Total Hardness and so on. On the whole, the concentration of such parameters, major cations, anions, trace elements (e.g. As, Cd, Zn, Cr, Cl, Al, Mn), and other elements (e.g. TSS, DO, DOB, Oil and Grease, C. Count, T. Coliform, F. Coliform) did not exceed the permissible limit for irrigation purposes, and thus is suitable for irrigation uses. Conversely, the slight Mg hazard with moderately hard to hard tendencies of water bodies suggests the restricted utilization of this water for irrigation. Therefore, this study finally recommends that the ongoing monitoring program continues with necessary precautionary measures for maintaining the quality of roadway water in the underground tunnel of the mine.

N2  - In arid and semi-arid regions, plant responses to water deficits at different phenological stages should be investigated for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management. This study was conducted under the regional conditions in the Konya province with a semi-arid climate for two years (2016–17) to determine the effects of irrigation applied at different growth stages on yield and quality traits of melon (Cucumis melo L. cv. Dardanos). Thus, a total of eight different irrigation treatments were implemented at three different growth stages of melon (from planting to flowering (V), flowering to fruit swelling (F), and fruit swelling to harvesting (M)). These treatments were specified as single-stage irrigation (V, F, and M), two-stage irrigation (VF, VM, and FM), irrigation for the whole season (VFM–stress-free), and non-irrigated. The seasonal total water consumption varied between 129.7 and 418.5 mm in 2016 and between 161.8 and 428.6 mm in 2017. The greatest fruit yield (52.9 t/ha) was obtained from stress-free VFM treatment; however, significant decreases were observed in fruit yields for other treatments. When yield and quality traits were assessed together, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that VF and FM treatments had similar values to VFM treatment. With regard to irrigation water productivity (IWP), there were no significant differences between VM and VFM treatments, and VM treatment provided about 47% water saving. On the other hand, significant decreases were observed in fruit yields of V, F, and M treatments, in which irrigation and the water stress were applied during only a single phenological stage and the other two periods, respectively. Since the yield response factor (ky) for the whole growing season of melon was greater than 1.0 (1.30), the melon was considered sensitive to water stress under semi-arid climatic conditions. In conclusion, two-stage irrigation treatments (VF, VM, and FM) could be applied in well-scheduled irrigation programs of melon for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management in arid and semi-arid regions.

N2  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are an important component of the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget for urban turfgrasses. A biogeochemical model DNDC successfully captured the magnitudes and patterns of N2O emissions observed at an urban turfgrass system at the Richland Creek Watershed in Nashville, TN. The model was then used to study the long-term (i.e. 75 years) impacts of lawn management practice (LMP) on soil organic carbon sequestration rate (dSOC), soil N2O emissions, and net Global Warming Potentials (net GWPs). The model simulated N2O emissions and net GWP from the three management intensity levels over 75 years ranged from 0.75 to 3.57 kg Nha−1yr−1 and 697 to 2443 kg CO2-eq ha−1yr−1, respectively, which suggested that turfgrasses act as a net carbon emitter. Reduction of fertilization is most effective to mitigate the global warming potentials of turfgrasses. Compared to the baseline scenario, halving fertilization rate and clipping recycle as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer can reduce net GWPs by 17% and 12%, respectively. In addition, reducing irrigation and mowing are also effective in lowering net GWPs. The minimum-maintenance LMP without irrigation and fertilization can reduce annual N2O emissions and net GWPs by approximately 53% and 70%, respectively, with the price of gradual depletion of soil organic carbon, when compared to the intensive-maintenance LMP. A lawn age-dependent best management practice is recommended: a high dose fertilizer input at the initial stage of lawn establishment to enhance SOC sequestration, followed by decreasing fertilization rate when the lawn ages to minimize N2O emissions. A minimum-maintained LMP with clipping recycling, and minimum irrigation and mowing, is recommended to mitigate global warming effects from urban turfgrass systems. Among all practices, clipping recycle may be a relatively malleable behavior and, therefore, a good target for interventions seeking to reduce the environmental impacts of lawn management through public education. Our results suggest that a long-term or a chronosequence study of turfgrasses with varying ages is warranted to capture the complete dynamics of contribution of turfgrasses to global warming.

N2  - Crop area optimization is essential for agricultural water management. However, decision makers are challenged by the complexity of fluctuating stream condition and irrigation quota, varying economic profits and crop yield, as well as grayness and errors in the estimated modeling parameters. A random-fuzzy-variable-based inexact two-stage stochastic chance-constrained programming (RFV-ITSCCP) model is developed for crop area optimization in response to such complexities in more efficient and sustainable ways. The model is capable of tackling parameters’ dual uncertainties of both randomness and fuzziness and meanwhile reflecting uncertainties expressed as intervals and probability distributions. Moreover, the developed model is helpful for managers in gaining insight into the tradeoffs between the system benefit and the constraint-violation risk. The RFV-ITSCCP model is applied in crop area optimization in the middle reaches of Heihe River basin, northwest of China. The results provide crop area allocation under various flow levels with the maximum system benefit under uncertainty, minimizing the penalty due to water deficit especially in arid and semi-arid area. The results show that the system efficiency (benefit per unit area) increases by 13.2% than conventional linear programming (LP) model with the most credible fuzzy number values under the same condition of water supply, irrigation regimes and socio-economic conditions, which can demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed RFV-ITSCCP model. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to analyze the impacts of key model parameters on the results. The obtained results are valuable for supporting the adjustment of the existing crop area patterns and identifying desired crop area schemes under complex uncertainties.

N2  - The land use and land cover map plays a significant role in agricultural, water resources planning, management, and monitoring programs at regional and national levels and is an input to various hydrological models. Land use and land cover maps prepared using satellite remote sensing techniques in conjunction with landform-soil-vegetation relationships and ground truth are popular for locating suitable sites for the construction of water harvesting structures, soil and water conservation measures, runoff computations, irrigation planning and agricultural management, analyzing socio-ecological concerns, flood controlling, and overall watershed management. Here we use a novel approach to analyze Sentinel–2 multispectral satellite data using traditional and principal component analysis based approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of maximum likelihood estimation, random forest tree, and support vector machine classifiers to improve land use and land cover categorization for Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model. Additionally, we use stratified random sampling to evaluate the accuracies of resulted land use and land cover maps in terms of kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. The classifiers were used for classifying the data into seven major land use and land cover classes namely water, built-up, mixed forest, cultivated land, barren land, fallow land with vertisols dominance, and fallow land with inceptisols dominance for the Vishwamitri watershed. We find that principal component analysis with support vector machine is able to produce highly accurate land use and land cover classified maps. Principal component analysis extracts the useful spectral information by compressing redundant data embedded in each spectral channel. The study highlights the use of principal component analysis with support vector machine classifier to improve land use and land cover classification from which policymakers can make better decisions and extract basic information for policy amendments.

N2  - Considerable NO3− contamination of underlying aquifers is associated with greenhouse-based vegetable production in south-eastern Spain, where 80% of cropping occurs in soil. To identify management factors likely to contribute to NO3− leaching from soil-based cropping, a survey of irrigation and N management practices was conducted in 53 commercial greenhouses. For each greenhouse: (i) a questionnaire of general irrigation and N management practices was completed, (ii) amounts of N applied in manure were estimated; and for one crop in each greenhouse: (a) irrigation volume was compared with ETc calculated using a mathematical model and (b) total amount of applied fertiliser N was compared with crop N uptake. Total irrigation during the first 6 weeks after transplanting/sowing was generally excessive, being >150 and >200% of modelled ETc in, respectively, 68 and 60% of greenhouses. During the subsequent period, applied irrigation was generally similar to modelled ETc, with only 12% of greenhouses applying >150% of modelled ETc. Large irrigations prior to transplanting/sowing were applied in 92% of greenhouses to leach salts and moisten soil. Volumes applied were >20 and >40mm in, respectively, 69 and 42% of greenhouses. Chemical soil disinfectants had been recently applied in 43% of greenhouses; associated irrigation volumes were >20 and >40mm in, respectively, 78 and 48% of greenhouses conducting disinfection. Nitrogen and irrigation management were generally based on experience, with very little use of soil or plant analysis. Large manure applications were made at greenhouse construction in 98% of greenhouse, average manure and N application rates were, respectively, 432m3ha−1 and 3046kgNha−1. Periodic manure applications were made in 68% of greenhouses, average application rates for farmyard and pelleted manures were, respectively, 157 and 13m3ha−1 (in 55 and 13% of greenhouses); the average N rate was 947kgNha−1. Manure N was not considered in N fertiliser programs in 74% of greenhouses. On average, 75% of fertiliser N was applied as NO3−. Applied fertiliser N was >1.5 and >2 times crop N uptake in, respectively, 42 and 21% of crops surveyed. The survey identified various management practices likely to contribute to NO3− leaching loss. Large manure applications and experiential mineral N management practices, based on NO3− application, are likely to cause accumulation of soil NO3−. Drainage associated with: (i) the combined effect of large irrigations immediately prior to and excessive irrigations for several weeks following transplanting/sowing and (ii) large irrigations for salt leaching and soil disinfection, is likely to leach accumulated NO3− from the root zone. This study demonstrated that surveys can be very useful diagnostic tools for identifying crop management practices, on commercial farms, that are likely to contribute to appreciable NO3− leaching.

N2  - In order to multi objectives and uncertainties in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources, this paper developed an improved interval multi-objectives programming method. The proposed model was then applied to a case study in Jinghuiqu irrigation district, Shaanxi Province, China. Maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption are regarded as planning objectives. A series of planting structure optimal schemes were obtained under different representative hydrological years. From the result, shortage of water resources has a negative effect on the development of Jinghuiqu irrigation district. Moreover, the remaining water resources prefer vegetable to wheat after meeting the minimum demand of the developed model, which characterized with high economic benefit and lower energy consumption. Moreover, due to the introduction of effective precipitation, a lot of irrigation water resources have been saved, such as 47.14% of total water consumption was saved when P = 25%. Furthermore, the desired optimal schemes can be obtained by the decision-makers based on the results of the developed model.

N2  - The area under irrigated corn has significantly increased in the Charente river basin during the last 10 years. Corn water requirements are maximum in the summer, the period with low water flows and highest environmental vulnerability. Periods of water shortage during which irrigation is temporarily forbidden occur frequently. To reduce water demand, specific water saving policies are required. This paper investigates irrigation management strategies at farm level during water shortages. A computer programme called IRMA is used to represent the farmer's decision making process. The model was calibrated and validated using information collected through a detailed monitoring of irrigation and farming practices of three representative farms during two irrigation seasons. The accuracy of the model was good; the difference between measured and simulated cumulative water volume used was slightly less than 8.5%. Analysis of daily simulated water demand shows that farmers have adopted different strategies to deal with water shortages, depending on the physical and socio-economic characteristics of their farms. The application presented in this paper stresses the potential of the proposed approach, if used on a larger farm sample, to compare the expected impact of different water management policies on water demand and irrigation practices at the farm level.

N2  - Increasing the reliability of irrigation water raises the cost of water storage and the price that farmers must pay for water. Evaluating farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for water is key to determining the reliability of irrigation water achievable. This paper presents a probabilistic optimization method for estimating the WTP to avoid water shortage. A nonlinear programming model was formulated to model water use and estimate a single farmer’s WTP when water shortage occurs. The model was subsequently expanded to include the WTP of a group of farmers relying on Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that low water prices do not have any effect on water use when there is no shortage of water. Facing water shortage, farmers employ irrigation systems with high efficiency to reduce the use and cost of irrigation water. They also change the cropping pattern to cultivate crops with low water requirements. The farmers’ WTP for irrigation water during shortage is assessed probabilistically and is found to be highly variable.

N2  - Study region
Middle Section of the Rio Grande Basin (MRG), U.S.
Study focus
Long-term tradeoffs of technologically possible land and water management interventions were analyzed to adapt irrigated agriculture to growing water scarcity in a desert environment under a projected warm-dry future. Nineteen different intervention scenarios were investigated to evaluate potential watershed-scale agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts in the MRG. The interventions are based on (i) management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops, (ii) changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought- and salt-tolerant crops, and (iii) limitations of the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model to perform scenario simulations.
New hydrological insights for the region
(1) status quo irrigation management cannot sustain the current crop mix in the face of dwindling river water and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century; (2) existing cropping and irrigation interventions create limited water savings; and (3) deficit irrigation of alfalfa or removing it from the crop mix allows moderate water savings to sustain high-value perennial pecan crops but the region will remain vulnerable to intensive, prolonged droughts. Strategies for future agricultural water sustainability in the study area could include transitioning to relatively drought- and salt-tolerant crops, desalinating brackish groundwater for irrigation, and developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use.

N2  - The primary source of emissions in broadacre cropping is synthetic
fertiliser applied to farmland, creating nitrous oxide from chemical
processes in the soil. In high yielding irrigated cotton production,
nitrogen remains a key input to maintain yields and maximise crop
returns. This study aims to identify immediate strategies available to
broadacre irrigation to reduce emissions and maintain profitability.
Four emission mitigation strategies on a large broadacre irrigation farm
in Northern New South Wales producing cereals, pulse and cotton crops
were modelled. The results show rotating cotton with pulse crops,
instead of wheat, can achieve an 8% reduction in emissions and increase
whole farm gross margin by 12%, due primarily to the current
historically high chickpea price and a reduction in applied nitrogen.
Combining enhanced efficiency fertilisers in cotton crops in a more
comprehensive abatement strategy has shown an indicative 13% emissions
reduction from the baseline scenario, with a 6% reduction in farm gross
margin from the increased fertiliser cost. However, uncertainty
regarding the impact of EEFs on cotton yield in vertosol soils is noted.
The soil sequestration from including a tree-lot in the emissions
reduction strategy reduced whole farm emissions by 11% and reduced
whole farm gross margin of 3%; however, difficulty in establishment and
high establishment costs can add economic risk. Combining all three
emissions reduction strategies results in a significant emissions
reduction of 33% and a 4% gain in whole farm gross margin. Sensitivity
analysis highlights gross margins results to be particularly sensitive
to chickpea price movement. With this desktop modelling in mind, the
discussion draws on industry research revealing that at a field scale,
carefully balanced agronomic nuances exist between cotton cropping
rotations and secure economic outcomes. The addition of achieving
environmental objectives simultaneously with these variables is yet
another future challenge facing government emissions abatement incentive
programs and broadacre cropping businesses.

N2  - A recent initiative in Madhya Pradesh, India to promote privately funded, rainwater harvesting structures on farmers’ own land has shown substantial economic and livelihood benefits. In contrast to the many poorly functioning, community managed rainwater harvesting programs, the individual or decentralized rainwater harvesting structures have led to significant improvements in availability of irrigation water, a revival of the agricultural economy of the region, and substantial increases in farmer incomes and livelihoods. Since 2006, more than 6000 farmers in the state have invested in on-farm ponds. The investments are highly cost effective and farmers are able to recover their initial investment in approximately 3 years. While longer-terms impact studies are needed, this initial assessment suggests that on-farm rainwater harvesting ponds are a promising private small irrigation option in Madhya Pradesh and similar regions in India and elsewhere.

N2  - Irrigation efficiency is an important consideration for selecting a suitable irrigation method in arid and semiarid regions. Crop canopy interception and wind drift may reduce sprinkler efficiency. However, the evapotranspiration suppression resulting from temperature reduction and humidity increase in sprinkler-irrigated fields versus non-irrigated fields, defined as microclimate modification in this article, imposed a positive effect on sprinkler efficiency. In this study, a sprinkler efficiency model based on the Cupid program was proposed for considering the effects of microclimate modification. The air temperature, relative humidity, plant transpiration, soil evaporation and sprinkler efficiency during the irrigation season of corn in the North China Plain were simulated using the model. The results indicated that the microclimate within the sprinkler-irrigated field could be modified during irrigation, and the effects continued for 10–20h after the application finished. When evapotranspiration suppression was considered, sprinkler efficiency could be improved by 5 percentiles versus non-irrigated fields. A sensitivity analysis of sprinkler efficiency was conducted by classifying the input variables of the model into three categories: constant, hourly and daily variables. It was found that the sprinkler efficiency was only generally sensitive to the leaf thermal emissivity for all constant and daily variables investigated. The sensitivity to hourly variables was greatly dependent upon the specific soil, plant and weather conditions during an irrigation event.

N2  - There is an urgent need for scientific management of agricultural water and land resources to cope with global warming and water shortages. Therefore, a stochastic multi-objective non-linear programming model was established under the society-economy-ecology framework in this study, which is capable of (1) considering the carbon sink function of farmland vegetation and the carbon emissions produced from the input of production materials; (2) dealing with the potential impact of agricultural water use on ecology by the indexes of water scarcity and degradation footprint (3) weighing the conflicts and contradictions among different developing targets with economic benefits, and water productivity as well as ecological considerations; (4) obtaining the planting structure, irrigation water allocation schemes and irrigation schedules. In order to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the model, it was applied to Huangyang Irrigation District in Shiyang River Basin, northwest China. After optimization, the net carbon sink increased by 2.55 × 104 t of which fertilizer contributed nearly 50% of carbon emission, while the water footprint reduced by 0.48 × 108 m3. To analyze the impact of the different allocation schemes of water and land resources on the ecological, economic and social subsystems as well as their interaction, coupling coordination degree (CCD) models were introduced to evaluate status quo and the optimization results of different models. The results showed that, compared with the single-objective models and the status quo, the proposed model has improved the value of CCD from 0.428 to 0.674. The proposed model can promote the harmonious and sustainable development of agricultural production and is equally applicable to agricultural management systems in the regions with similar conditions.

N2  - Quantifying and comparing sustainability indicators are essential to improve the sustainability of smallholder rice cropping systems. The sustainability of rice production systems can be measured based on economic, environmental, social, and institutional indicators. In this paper, we restrict our assessment to economic and environmental indicators. During 2012–2015, farmers were interviewed from 847 households from intensively irrigated rice production regions in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and China. We assessed the sustainability of their farming practices using economic and environmental indicators, i.e., eight of the 12 performance indicators (PIs), as defined by the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). Across the six sites, there was a yield gap of 24–42% and a profit gap of 36–82% between the 10% highest-performing farms (mean of top decile) and the mean-performing farms. In addition, there was a labor productivity gap of 12–32%, a nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) gap of 11–20%, a phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) gap of 1–29%, and a water productivity gap of 12–42%. Deliberate modification of conventional practices, including not flooding the field for >30 days before rice planting, incorporating pre-rice crop residue >30 days before planting, and adoption of mid-season drainage or alternate wetting and drying irrigation rather than continuous flood irrigation during the rice growing period, could substantially reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in irrigated rice fields without yield penalty. There is an urgent need to adopt improved management strategies for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fertilizer, irrigation water-use efficiency, as well as for decreasing pesticide use frequency, without sacrificing profitability and yield. We identified the following priority interventions for each site: a) increasing fertilizer use and adopting higher-yielding varieties in Bago, Myanmar; b) reducing pesticide application rates in Can Tho, Vietnam; c) reducing fertilizer use in Guangdong, China; d) reducing nitrogen and labor use in Yogyakarta, Indonesia; e) reducing fertilizer and water use in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka and; f) reducing fertilizer use in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand. Additional uses of the PI analysis clearly demonstrated that rice yield and profit gaps can sustainably be closed by increasing efficiencies that will also lead to reduced environmental footprint.

N2  - Smallholder farmers are highly vulnerable to climate change and require prioritised strategies to minimise the impacts. Challenges faced by smallholder farmers hinder the implementation of coping and adaptation strategies, limiting sustainable agriculture. This study prioritised climate change coping and adaptation strategies and developed a plan to promote implementation by smallholder farmers. Linear additive model of multicriteria decision analysis within CLIMACT Prio tool Excel Spreadsheet was used to prioritise 16 strategies, in consultation with 23 stakeholders. Stakeholders included smallholder farmers, academics, municipal and government officials. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the effect of changing weights on final ranking of the strategies. Reducing production space to maximise irrigation had the highest score of 1 and rank of 1 while reducing sand mining had the lowest score of 0.82 and rank of 7. Adjusting fertilisers, food preservation, reducing sand mining along river banks, planting high-yielding crop varieties and reducing soil erosion had an equal score of 0.95 and rank of 2. Varying the weight of each criterion did not affect ranking of the strategies. The study found that most strategies had short implementation time frames and were classified as coping strategies. Identified benefits of the prioritised strategies support national, regional and global development goals. The study provided information required for decision support which is an integral part of climate services. It also promotes improvement of relevant stakeholders’ policies and programs to support smallholder farmers.

N1  - Water, Science, Technology and Policy Convergence and Action by All (A Meeting Point for Action leading to Sustainable Development)
N2  - Globally, there is a general lack of consensus on how the available water resources can be allocated efficiently and equitably among its competing uses. In irrigated agriculture, this decodes to the central question of how this sector can be balanced in the manner that it produces more ‘crops per drop’ using less water and releasing adequate water for use by other sectors while concurrently enhancing rural income and livelihoods. This requires that the values and costs of irrigated agriculture, at all levels, are well understood and appropriate interventions made. Based on this ground, this paper presents an economic analysis of the value of irrigated paddy in Usangu basin. It attempts to answer the question of what will be the effects if farmers in Usangu stop producing irrigated paddy. The analysis shows that: (a) about 576mm3 of water––currently consumed in paddy irrigation, or 345.6mm3––traded inter-regionally as “virtual water” would be utilized in alternative ways, either as evaporation from seasonal swamps within the basin or made available for other intersectoral uses, (b) there will be a shrinkage in the annual paddy supply (both at the local and national levels) of about 105,000t of paddy (66,000t of rice)-equivalent to 14.4% of the total annual paddy production in Tanzania, (c) an opportunity cost of about US$15.9 million will be incurred annually (equivalent to US$530.95 per annum per household practicing irrigated paddy in Usangu), and d) the country’s current account of the balance of payments will be affected by an average of US$15.9 million per annum. The effect will either be in form of annual decline in rice exports or increase in imports depending on the country’s supply and demand for rice.

N2  - This paper discusses the optimal water allocation and cropping patterns for the Jordan Valley, taking into consideration variations in expected incomes from agricultural production and rising water prices. The calculations were based on information available on water supplies, areas under irrigation and market conditions, and used linear programming models for determining solutions that maximize gross margins and minimize potential variations in these gross margins. The results indicated that optimizing cropping patterns and the allocation of irrigation water still has a substantial potential to increase the financial return from agriculture. Optimal solutions that consider risk from varying gross margins react quite elastically in terms of demand for irrigation water to rising water prices. This adds the element of a changing market supply to any discussion about managing water consumption between sectors of the society by using pricing mechanisms.

N2  - Land is a key factor in production agriculture and the land rental market is an important institution in agriculture. Rental activity of both sharecropped and fixed rent arrangements represents about 25% of cultivated land in the Philippines. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) of 1988, which essentially redistributes land to landless farmers, has implications for land ownership and farm productivity. This study investigates the impact of land ownership on the productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers in the Philippines. We use a 2007–2012 Loop Survey from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and a stochastic frontier function method. Results show that land ownership has a significant impact on technical efficiency. In particular, counter to the theory, the CARP may have reduced the technical efficiency of leasehold farmers compared with owner operators. Additionally, results show that land area, fuel cost, fertilizer cost, irrigation cost, and labor cost are significant factors that affect rice production. We found a mean technical efficiency score of 0.79—still leaving room for improvement. Finally, educated females and farmers leasing land have higher technical inefficiency.

N2  - Rolling hill style topography is a common feature of agricultural land throughout the United States. Topographic complexity causes subfield variation in soil resources such as water and nutrients, leading to a mosaic of high- and low-productivity zones that can shift from one year to the next due to weather. Stabilizing yields across these productivity zones using agroecological methods may improve land use efficiency, prevent unnecessary cropland expansion, and reduce the environmental impact of these systems. Here, we hypothesized that cover crops may help to reduce soil water and nutrient losses and increase the stability of subsequent maize yields across time and space. We performed a field study to evaluate the effect of a cereal rye (Secale Cereale L.) cover crop on maize (Zea mays L.) yield at three landscape positions (summit, backslope, and toeslope) in Central KY in 2018–2019, and calibrated the DSSAT v4.7.0.001 computer simulation program to test our hypothesis across a thirty-year period. Our field trial showed pronounced variability in maize yield across different landscape positions, ranging from 6.3 Mg ha−1 in the backslope, to 12.2 Mg ha−1 in the toeslope. Model simulations were consistent with results from our field trial and indicated that low yields in the backslope were primarily due to water stress, with >10 % yield reductions in 17 out of 30 simulated years relative to simulations under irrigated conditions where water was not limiting. In contrast, the toeslope and summit positions experienced >10 % yield reductions due to water stress in only 6 of the 30 years. Growing a cereal rye cover crop before maize reduced the frequency of water stress and raised maize yields in the backslope by 6% (500 kg ha-1) on average, and 24 % (1235 kg ha-1) during dry years. The coefficient of variation across all weather conditions and landscape positions was reduced from 33 % to 26 % when maize followed a rye cover crop compared to fallow. The yield benefits of the cover crop were associated with decreased soil evaporation and runoff that increased water availability during anthesis and late maize reproductive phases. Crop model simulations allowed us to evaluate and parse out the fundamental drivers of the interaction between cover crops and complex topography under different weather scenarios. Overall, our study demonstrates the outsized potential of cover crops to increase and stabilize grain yields in rolling hill landscapes and emphasizes the value of cover crops as a tool for ecological intensification.

N2  - Land consolidation projects (LCP) are the most effective method for quick amendment of poor land fragmentation parameters. At the same time, they are costly due to both a long time horizon and auxiliary projects, in particular, road construction and improvement of field drainage or irrigation systems. The range of changes in parcel arrangement after consolidation varies, as does the economic efficiency of LCPs related to the changes. The paper proposes a approach to the assessment of LCPs that takes into account the production and income effects, which influence the income of farmers participating in consolidation processes, and potential benefits, such as the increased value of farmland and the effect of improved quality of cadastral documentation. Static and dynamic economic feasibility indices were calculated. In the latter case, a thirty-year life of the project and a 2.5 % discount rate were assumed. The study involved six projects completed in Poland under the European Union Rural Development Programme 2007–2013. The effectiveness of the investments was found to vary significantly. The calculated payback period was most often a few to several dozen years, depending on the project, index, and scope of considered effects. It has been demonstrated that if potential economic rents are included, the estimated payback period for an LCP can be reduced several times. It was further concluded that it is necessary to develop a method for the valuation of non-production effects of LCPs such as social, environmental, and landscape benefits.

N2  - The role of artificial forests in the UAE to protect floral diversity was evaluated, through the determination of the effect of forest trees on species diversity and abundance of perennial plants in six forests. The impact of artificial forests on physical and chemical characters of the soil was also evaluated. The results showed insignificant variation in species richness and species diversity index among the six studied forests. The effects of type and size of trees grown in the forest trees were significant on all the studied community attributes. All the attributes were significantly greater inside than outside forests cultivated with the native Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce and Acacia arabica (Lam.) Willd. trees. The reverse was true in forests cultivated with exotic Eucalyptus sp. and Prosopis juliflora trees. It is recommended, therefore, that exotic trees be replaced with native ones, in order to promote species richness and diversity. Species richness, diversity and density were higher under medium than under large size P. cineraria trees. This suggests the importance of reducing forest crowns to promote species growth. The palatable Panicum turgidum and Pennisetum divisum grasses attained significantly high frequencies and densities inside the forests, but were not recorded at all outside. The reverse was true for other non-palatable species. Afforestation significantly reduced soil pH under and between the tree crowns, compared to outside them. Organic matter content, salinity, total sodium ions, total sulfate, total soluble nitrogen, total chromium and copper attained significantly greater values under the crowns of the trees than both between the crowns and outside the forests. The great increase in soil salinity, especially Na ions, is an indicator of the high salinity in irrigation waters. Afforestation in the UAE can be an effective tool to promote diversity and improve soil quality, provided afforestation programs are carefully planned and well executed, because any miscalculations could lead to serious environmental damages.

N2  - Groundwater is one of Australia’s most important natural resources and is the only source of water available for many regions, supplying urban areas, agriculture, industry, and mining developments. The economic value to the economy is estimated to be $A33.8 billion. This chapter gives an overview of the occurrence of the major aquifers in Australia and the rapid development of groundwater resources over the past 40–50 years, together with the evolution of management approaches. Water reform in Australia has progressed well over the last two decades. An agreement between the federal and state governments (the National Water Initiative) has resulted in statutory groundwater management plans, a system of secure water entitlements that can be traded, sustainable extraction limits, and a commitment to reduce entitlements in overallocated resources to sustainable levels. Current extraction is about 5000GL/year with 70% used for irrigation. Early management intervention has resulted in only 2% of Australia’s management areas being overexploited. This chapter also discusses future challenges for groundwater management in Australia, including potential impacts of climate change, mining impacts, and declining government funding.

N2  - The full implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) in Europe will contribute to obtain treated wastewaters of quite high quality that could be reused for certain applications or improved by polishing steps for uses with higher quality requirements. Even though reclaimed water reuse is currently implemented in many European countries, mainly for irrigation, its potential has not yet been exploited in many areas. In fact, a decisive factor to achieve a higher percentage of water reuse is the establishment of effective incentives, which in many instances will be of either an economic or a regulatory nature. The limiting factor for water reuse can in many circumstances be the quality of the water available linked to the treatment processes (technology) and potential hazards for secondary users. In any case, its economic viability needs a careful cost-benefit analysis for the various parties involved to be carried out. However, some water reuse implementation projects have failed because some other key factors, such as social awareness or associated ecological effects, were not accounted for. Thus, the consideration of regulatory, economic, technological, social and environmental factors seems essential to successfully accomplish a reclaimed water reuse project. Feasibility studies can contribute to obtain the success in the implementation of a water reuse project. Within AQUAREC a feasibility study methodology for the performance of water reuse projects has been developed, considering the above mentioned key factors and providing the tools for their analysis. These guidelines aim at assisting the different stakeholders (administration, engineering companies, water management bodies, etc.) involved in the implementation of a water reuse programme in a specific area. AQUAREC Handbook on Feasibility Studies for Water Reuse Systems, publicly available, deals with all information needs necessary to successfully face a water reuse project. Background information data collection support, technology options evaluation or environmental impact assessment guidelines are offered in this publication. Furthermore, the assessment methodologies and indicators for social, economic and environmental factors are also provided. Last but not least, cost effectiveness analysis methodologies and technology validation are also addressed.

N2  - Hexaploid spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm from CIMMYT's breeding program in Mexico has assisted wheat improvement in Australia, particularly in the north-eastern region where terminal drought frequently reduces grain yield. A total of 273 conventional hexaploid and derived synthetic hexaploid spring wheats from CIMMYT, along with 15 locally adapted Australian cultivars (Oz lines), were evaluated for grain yield over four years in a total of 27 environments in Australia's north-eastern wheat region. The CIMMYT conventional spring wheats were from a Seri/Babax recombinant inbred line population (SB lines), elite entries from an International Adaptation Trial (IAT lines) introduced to Australia between 1999 and 2004 and from CIMMYT screening nurseries introduced to Australia in 2004–2005 (SW lines). Synthetic wheats (SYN lines) were also from these nurseries as well as from a separate program of synthetic wheat introductions to Australia over 2001–2004. Across all environments SB lines were the highest yielding, with 16 broadly adapted SB lines having advantages of 6–10% over seven broadly adapted Oz lines. In a subset of high yielding environments broadly adapted SB, SW and IAT lines were the highest yielding classes, with advantages of 3–8% over these broadly adapted Oz lines. Relative to older CIMMYT spring wheats in the IAT class, the more recent CIMMYT SW lines were better adapted to low yielding environments, with yield advantages of 5% over broadly adapted Oz lines, but they also had the capacity to respond to more favourable conditions. SYN lines were specifically adapted to a subset of lower yielding environments where yields of the broadly adapted synthetics were 5% higher, and up to 13% for individual lines, than that of the broadly adapted Oz lines. Our results support CIMMYT's use of synthetic wheats to improve adaptation to drier environments, and CIMMYT's current breeding strategy of sequential selection under water-stress and irrigation to improve adaptation in drier environments while retaining capacity to respond to more favourable conditions. CIMMYT germplasm has been identified that would be useful as parents in Australian breeding programs targeting rainfed environments with high probabilities of water deficit during the grain filling period. This germplasm should also be adapted globally to similar non-irrigated regions within CIMMYT's mega-environments ME1, ME4c and semi-arid to arid regions of ME5.

N2  - In four communities in the Peruvian Andes, 56 farmers were interviewed
every three months over a period of one year. Information linked to milk
and cattle production such as activities, inputs (labour, means of
production, capital) and outputs (milk, cheese, animals) were recorded
using a closed-ended questionnaire. The communities were divided into
two groups with low (LC) and high (HC) level of dependence on income
from milk and animal sales. The survey results showed that cattle
production on the LC farms was based on less land and a smaller herd
(3.32 ha/farm, 1.06 lactating cows) than on HC farms (10.28 ha/farm,
4.19 lactating cows). The data from the survey and the results of the
nutritional analyses of 74 feed samples were introduced into a model
that applied linear programming techniques in order to estimate the farm
household income under the current production systems and evaluate the
economic impact of improved forage varieties for hay production.
Furthermore, the economic viability of other changes in fodder and herd
management was tested. Both groups were characterised by a dual-purpose
system generating a gross income from the sale of both, milk and live
animals in the amount of -21 (LC) and +1057 US$/farm and year (HC). Due
to higher production costs for forages and better access to markets, LC
communities were characterised by an integrated crop-livestock system
whereas in the HC group income was mainly based on livestock.
Introduction of improved and fertilized barley for hay production, was
estimated to increase the annual farm income to 127 and 1257 US$ for LC
and HC, respectively. This increase was accompanied by an increment of
the animal number. Maintaining the animal number but increasing the milk
production/cow by feeding additional forage was a less profitable option
generating 50 and 1221 US$ of income per farm and year for LC and HC,
respectively. The production of hay was limited by high costs (external
labour) in LC communities and the restricted availability of family
labour in the HC group. A scenario based on the use of improved cow
genotypes led to the highest estimated annual farm income for HC
communities (1280 US$) but was less favourable for LC. The modelling
results showed that the best development strategy depends on various
factors such as production costs, access to the markets and to
irrigation and availability of different feed resources. (C) 2009

N2  - Research about adaptation of crops to climate change at a regional scale
is based on simplifying assumptions about current and future weather and
about farmer management practices. Additionally, the impacts of
adaptations are usually measured only in production terms and the
feasibility of implementing proposed adaptations is rarely tested. In
this study into adaptations of rice based cropping systems to future
climate scenarios in Telangana, India, all adaptations were generated
through participatory engagement, and were field-tested with local
smallholder households in three villages as well as by cropping system
simulation analysis. Adaptation options were first evaluated for
historical climate variability, with outcomes assessed in terms of
production, profitability and environmental consequences before they
were evaluated as climate-smart adaptations to medium term climate
change. In an earlier study, participatory intervention at household
level was used to identify and evaluate new practices. These adaptations
to climate variability were then tested with the cropping systems
simulator APSIM on local historical weather data. Here We test the
applicability of these adaptations to likely climate scenarios in
2021-2040 by using and statistically downscaling two contrasting global
circulation models to generate contrasting climate change scenarios for
each location. Adaptations were simulated with these future climate data
sets and evaluated in terms of their gross margin, yield, yield
stability, gross margin stability, global warming potential, greenhouse
gas emissions intensity and, where irrigation treatments were varied,
net water use, irrigation water productivity, contribution to the
recharge of aquifers and nitrogen leached from the root zone. Compared
with variability in historic yields the Simulated yield changes in
2021-2040 climate scenarios were modest and their direction was
dependent on the global circulation model used. Sustainability polygons
were used to compare historic and future climate scenarios. These
polygons clearly showed that adaptation options mostly resulted in
trade-offs between productivity and environmental Outcomes and between
competing environmental outcomes. Results that were simulated for
historic weather were strongly reflected in the two future weather
scenarios, leading to the conclusion that participatory action research
with smallholder farmers, coupled with field testing and simulation
analysis can produce practical, sustainable and productive adaptations
to climate variability that are also climate smart in that they are
robust for future climate scenarios to 2021-2040. We propose that
sustainability polygons may be a useful quantitative tool for analysis
of the degree to which adaptations may be regarded as climate smart.

N2  - An integrated biophysical and economic model is used to determine the effects of using more water efficient irrigation systems and trade in water rights on the environmental performance of irrigation enterprises in the Mooki catchment within the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. We find that improved water use efficiency increased profit in the presence of modern irrigation technologies and water trading. Salinity risk downstream is reduced due to the fall in saline discharge from the catchment, and irrigation water is traded away from ecologically significant regions. It is important that the institutional setup gives confidence in the security of water supplies. When irrigators can be assured about the security of their water entitlements in the context of water reform policies, incentives emerge for them to invest in water efficient irrigation technologies and to participate in the water market. Environmental performance can thereby be improved without the need for financial support from the government. Further, minimal government intervention is required to address salinity; given the conjunctive nature of secondary salinity and water use it can be cost-efficient to address both environmental flow and salinity mitigation with a single policy instrument.

N2  - Agricultural water management, particularly management of multi-purpose small reservoirs (SRs) in drier savanna areas of the northern Ghana, is being promoted as a key solution to improve agricultural production, enhance food security and livelihoods of smallholder farm households. However, little empirical evidence exist on how effective these small water infrastructures are in terms of delivering multiple benefits and their impact on the livelihood of smallholder farmers. This study assessed the effectiveness and impact of the small reservoirs on smallholder vegetable farmers in northern Ghana. A participatory rating method using a 5-point Likert-scale was used to assess the effectiveness of SRs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits and an endogenous switching regression model was applied to assess the SRs’ impact using a primary data collected from 328 randomly sampled vegetable farmers. Results from the Likert scale analysis show that most of the SRs are either dysfunctional or underutilized and not effective in delivering multiple benefits. Results from the endogenous switching regression model show that there is only about 3% increase in the income of vegetable farmers participating in irrigated vegetable production using SRs against the counterfactual situation but this change is insignificant statistically. The current low level effectiveness and impact of SRs could be enhanced by improving their management, for example, through the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation, management and irrigation service provision and strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations. Furthermore, small reserviors should be recognized not only as water sources for small scale irrigation but also as providers of multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and consequently should attract due attention in public resource allocation in their rehabilitation and management/institutional capacity building.

N2  - Predicting the impacts of water management policies under uncertainty can support policy-makers in making sound decisions. Most previous methods for policy-impact simulation lacked a calibration process that would allow model results to match observed values, and did not address the inherent uncertainties. To fill this methodological knowledge gap, an interval credibility-constrained positive mathematical programming (ICPMP) approach was first developed in this study for simulating the impacts of water management policies. This method improved over traditional positive mathematical programming in terms of uncertainty treatment. It also improved upon inexact programming methods through activating a calibration process. ICPMP was then coupled with a multi-attribute decision-making approach, leading to a simulation-evaluation method that could support the analysis and screening of policy alternatives. This method has been applied to an agricultural water management problem in northwestern China. Various policy alternatives corresponding to different water prices and varied fuzzy credibility levels of water availability were investigated. The impacts of these alternatives over farmers’ income, irrigation water consumption, benefit per cubic meter of water, planting area, and fertilizer use were simulated through ICPMP. Forty policy alternatives with better indicator performances were selected to be comprehensively evaluated using the multi-attribute decision-making approach. The results indicated that when the decision-makers have a positive preference for water availability, the water price at the turning point of water use efficiency (i.e. benefit per cubic of water) was recommended. When decision-makers have conservative attitude towards water availability, it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged. Comparisons of ICPMP against traditional methods indicated that, ICPMP could generate more reliable results through incorporating uncertain information as inputs and reproducing actual situation. As well, solutions of ICPMP could provide in-depth analysis of the trade-offs between violation risk and system benefits. ICPMP and the associated simulation-evaluation method are also applicable to analyze other types of policies.

N1  - Irrigation efficiency and productivity: scales, systems and science
N2  - Irrigated agriculture is facing rising competition worldwide for access to reliable, low cost, high quality water. In England, farmers are under regulatory pressure to improve irrigation efficiency; indeed, demonstrating efficient water use is now a prerequisite for renewing an irrigation abstraction licence (permit). However, there are differences between the concepts of efficient water use as viewed by scientists, regulators and farmers, further confused by the overlap of similar terminology with both precise technical and wider less specific meanings. Most farmers’ concepts of water efficiency are linked to maximising the farms’ economic productivity rather than saving water per se, except perhaps when their own allocated resources may be inadequate. Using a financial criteria for water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears a sensible approach when assessing irrigation performance at the farm level, since any managerial (e.g. scheduling) and operational (e.g. equipment) inefficiencies associated with irrigation are implicitly included in the assessment. It also allows comparison between individual irrigators (benchmarking) and between different water sectors (e.g. agriculture, leisure, industry). However, estimating the direct financial benefits (value) of water to the farm is only part of the equation; assessing indirect economic benefits, such as the importance of irrigated production to the sustainability of rural communities is equally important, but much harder to achieve. Demonstrating efficient or ‘best’ use of water is not straightforward, but farmers and the water regulator need a rational approach that reflects the needs of the farming community whilst providing a policy framework for protecting the environment. This paper reviews the concept of irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate, considers the farmer perspectives, and supports using the ‘pathway to efficiency’ as a means to assist farmers and the water regulator in achieving better irrigation management and abstraction control.

N2  - Sand media filters are specially used to avoid emitter clogging when water with large amount of organic pollutants like effluents are used in micro-irrigation systems. Estimation of water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen at sand filter outlet (DOo) is of great interest for irrigation engineers. Artificial neural networks (ANN), Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Multi Linear Regression (MLR) based models were trained for estimating DOo using data from 769 experimental filtration cycles. Instead of considering a single configuration of the training and test data sets, which is the usual procedure for those applications in agricultural studies, the performance of those models was assessed through k-fold testing, ensuring a complete performance evaluation. In general, the GEP model tended to provide the most accurate estimations, followed by ANN and, lastly, by MLR models. After the evaluation of the models, the GEP approach was used to provide a new equation to estimate DOo based on the complete data set. This procedure revealed that only inlet DO, pH, electrical conductivity and filter head loss were necessary to feed the models. Furthermore, the consideration of leave one out or, at least, k-fold assessment should be advisable to perform a suitable evaluation of the model performance. Otherwise, conclusions drawn might be only partially valid.

N2  - With the introduction of irrigation in areas with rolling topography, low-lying areas are prone to water logging and soil salinization. The problems also occurred in the valley bottoms of the Tungabhadra Irrigation Project (TBP). Subsurface drainage was applied to reclaim the waterlogged saline land in an area of 62ha (1ha = 10,000m2). The drainage system consisted of three pipe drains laid parallel to the valley brook at a spacing of 150m. The monitoring and evaluation of the system revealed that the water table was lowered; electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil decreased and crop yield and cropping intensity increased in the drained area. Hence, the intervention effectively reclaimed the land, even though the spacing was unusually wide. The cultivation of submerged lowland rice aided in the leaching of salts within a period of one year. Originally the drains were thought to function as interceptor drains and their main effect would stem from intercepting the underground seepage water from the canals in the upland. On the other hand, while assessing the performance of the system, it was observed that drainage discharge and EC of the drainage effluent in all three drains were of the same magnitude. It emerges, therefore, that the system was rather working as a normal subsurface drainage system than as an interceptor system.

N2  - CONTEXT: The planned interventions to enhance adaptation and build
resilience of predominantly rainfed and vulnerable smallholder
production systems to climate change in African drylands include
small-scale irrigation using rainwater harvesting reservoirs. However,
the required technological improvement, participatory breakthroughs,
institutional settings, farm risk management, and investment
justification are rarely established comprehensively and integrated into
adaptive planning.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and assess new reservoir-based climate-resilient
and risk-efficient irrigation cropping strategies synthesizing
technological, participatory, institutional, managerial, and investment
capabilities.
METHODS: We crafted an innovative rice and vegetable pond irrigation
system together with governance arrangements and cropping schedule
adjustments tailored to the system. The system was validated through a
fiveyear participatory on-farm experiment in northern Ghana. Using
agronomic, hydrological, and socioeconomic data obtained from the
experiments and surveys, we constructed and extended empirical
bioeconomic models through simple risk programming to identify
irrigation cropping strategies that are the most efficient in securing
smallholders' food and income and resilient to interannual climate
fluctuations. The net present values were computed to determine the
financial effects of the identified strategies on the investment payback
of the pond system.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Shifting sowing dates allowed smallholders to
irrigate timely, albeit sparingly, without compromising their autonomous
adaptations in rainfed systems. Supplementary irrigation and improved
weed control increased the average rice yield by 23%, more than doubled
the profitability, and lowered the coefficients of its variation
compared to that of rainfed rice (from 48% to 38%). Vegetable
irrigation in the dry season was even more profitable. The
risk-efficient cropping strategies identified by empirical models mostly
combined multiple rainfed crop choices with balanced irrigation
allocation between rice and vegetables enabling food self-sufficiency
and increased income level and stability. A 5000 m(3) pond storage
capacity was sufficient to secure these benefits under the observed
climate fluctuations. The cropping strategy found to produce sufficient
financial increments to achieve mid-term (8-to-12-years) payback of pond
investment under the same level of risk that smallholders accepted under
rainfed systems is among the most advisable.
SIGNIFICANCE: We addressed multidimensional challenges underlying
planned adaptation through reservoir irrigation. The innovative pond
system established can offer promising alternatives and complement
smallholder autonomous adaptations to secure food and income under a
changing climate. The identified strategic compromise between farm risk
management and investment payback can reconcile local intention and
policy guidance to develop concerted adaptation actions.

acreage in the world. Tobacco is criticized because it causes health
problems to its consumers and because production causes environmental
damage such as soil degradation, deforestation and water pollution.
Diversification has been indicated as the strategy for a sustainable
economic development for farmers. In the specific case of Valle de
Lerma, many years of continuous tobacco mono-cropping, excessive
ploughing and poor irrigation control have caused soil degradation of
the land used for tobacco. Tobacco farming in Salta also entails a
production and a price risk which is increasing because of uncertainty
surrounding governmental subsidies. The objective of this article is to
assess the impact of diversification on expected farm income, income
risk and soil organic matter (as an indicator of soil degradation) on
specialized tobacco farms.
To reach this objective, a quadratic programming model of a typical
specialized tobacco farm is developed. Soil organic matter is included
in the model by means of the concept of the carbon balance. The carbon
balance is the difference between carbon supply and carbon decline in a
year. Two different situations with respect to soil degradation are
evaluated using the model. The current situation includes no restriction
on carbon balance while the desired situation includes the restriction
that the carbon balance cannot be negative. So farmers' choices are
valuated with and without carbon balance constraints.
The model results for the current situation show that, no matter which
risk attitude is used, the maximum area of land given irrigation
possibilities is devoted to tobacco, while the rest of the land is
assigned to the non-irrigated crop soybean. The carbon balance is
negative and soil continues to degrade. In the desired situation,
tobacco and soybean are partly replaced by bull beef production
(including the production of alfalfa and maize for silage) to fulfill
the requirement of a no negative carbon balance. As the risk aversion
coefficient in this situation increases, the low risk crop chickpea
enters the solution and bull beef decreases. The requirement of no
further soil degradation comes at a high cost since gross margin of the
farm is decreased by some 35% compared to the current situation.
Finally, the model is used to explore the effects of an abolishment of
governmental subsidies on tobacco. In this situation the production plan
consists of soybean, bull beef and tobacco in such a proportion that the
carbon balance is positive. Income effects of an abolishment of
governmental subsidies on tobacco would be large as the gross margin of
the farm decreases by some 60%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Concern that pharmaceuticals may be escaping into the environment where the potency and persistence of certain compounds at trace concentrations could be chronically affecting biota is growing. Hitherto the main focus has been on human medications, personal care products and industrial endocrine disrupting chemicals. These generally enter sewerage systems where there is at least the prospect of partial removal by treatment plants before they enter waterways. By contrast, the agricultural sector, a significant user of veterinary pharmaceuticals, has no such treatment – compounds are deposited straight to ground in dung and urine or washed from hides in the case of topical applications. This study investigates the fate of a number of antibiotic compounds (as well as the insect repellent, DEET, via a pilot assessment) used in herd health programs on dairy farms in the cow-rich Macalister Irrigation District in Victoria, Australia. Results from samples taken from irrigation drainage channels and streams demonstrate that these compounds are foot printing into an aquatic environment that extends to the Ramsar-designated Gippsland Lakes and associated wetland system. Conclusions are drawn as to how this problem might be lessened by a targeted water quality monitoring program and some rather straightforward changes to farm management practices.

N2  - Container Crop Resource Optimization Program (CCROP) is an integrative model which simulates the growth and water and nutrient requirements of a woody ornamental shrub grown in small (2.8–11.4L) containers in a field environment with overhead sprinkler irrigation. The model was developed for producers, producer advisers and researchers to support best management practice decision-making in container nursery production. We describe the primary processes simulated by CCROP particularly how they differ from traditional crops grown in-ground and assess the ability of CCROP to simulate measured values for a range of irrigation and fertilizer trials and transplanting dates. Results of model testing with 11 trials indicate that CCROP provided reasonable outcomes for biomass and leaf area growth as well as evapotranspiration, runoff (container drainage plus un-intercepted irrigation and rainfall) and nitrogen loss.

N2  - The present study investigates alternative scenarios of timing and reduced water supply in terms of their impacts on agricultural land use, farm revenue and food crop production. It aims to evaluate the implications for the development of different farming systems in one of the most water-scarce irrigation districts in the Zayandeh-Rud River Basin in central Iran, the Roudasht irrigation district. A modified version of Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model was used to assess the scenarios. The results from the scenario simulations illustrate that there is substantial potential for improving the management of the limited water supply in the Roudasht irrigation network to reach higher water productivity, agricultural output and gross margins from agricultural activities. A management plan to target a limit in the irrigation water supply only for the month of peak demand, e.g. 60% to 80% of the baseline water supply for May in Roudasht, may have less adverse effects than planning to limit the annual water supply by the same amount but without specifying the monthly timing of the water supply. These results highlight the relevance and impact of the timing of water supply when devising adaptive measures related to the irrigation water supply.

N2  - Drought is a major abiotic constraint to rice production in rainfed lowland and insufficiently irrigated areas. The improvement of drought tolerant varieties is one of the strategies to reduce the negative effects of drought. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for primary and secondary traits related to drought tolerance (DT) on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9 that determined from double haploid lines derived from a cross between CT9993 and IR62266 were introgressed and dissected into small pieces in the genetic background of Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) to develop chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) population. The CSSLs were evaluated at the reproductive stage for their agronomic performance and yield components under drought stress, and results were compared with irrigated condition. The flowering of CSSL lines was 6 to 7 d earlier than KDML105. The mean values of grain yields in the CSSLs were higher than KDML105 under drought and irrigated conditions. At irrigated condition, the grain yields of introgression lines carrying DT-QTLs from chromosomes 4 and 8 were higher than that of KDML105, whereas other traits showed little difference with KDML105. Analysis indicated that grain yield has positive correlation with plant height, tiller and panicle number per plant, and total grain weight per plant under drought stress while negatively correlated with days to flowering. As mentioned above, CSSLs showing good adaptation under drought stress can be used as genetic materials to improve drought tolerance in Thai rainfed lowland rice breeding program, and as materials to dissect genes underlying drought tolerance.

N2  - Reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture soils is crucial, as it accounts for 5.6–6.8% of global anthropogenic emissions. This study aims to understand the interaction among climate, soil nitrogen (N) and applied N on N2O emissions from the irrigated cotton farming system and its implications on farm economics. We conducted simulations for 116 years (1900–2015) and assessed the effect of different N-fertiliser application rates, initial soil nitrate (NO3) N levels and rainfall conditions on N2O emissions, N2O emission factors (EFs) and financial returns (with and without N2O costs). Results showed the following. 1) The proportional impact of higher N fertiliser rates on soil N2O emissions was greater when initial soil N level was lower (5 mg NO3 kg−1) than higher (35 mg NO3 kg−1). However, the volume of impact was greater under higher initial soil N levels. 2) The relationship between N fertiliser rates and the EFs (range 0.03–7.2%) was not linear but bell-shaped. 3) Fertiliser N requirements increased with rainfall and decreased with initial soil N. Accordingly, the cotton returns for the driest rainfall condition (<10th percentile) were maximum at 300, 250 and 150 kg N ha−1 for initial soil N of 5, 20 and 35 mg NO3 kg−1. For the wettest rainfall condition (>90th percentile), these rates were 50 kg ha−1 higher across the initial soil N conditions. Any additional application of N-fertiliser above these rates was counterproductive. 4) Inclusion of N2O cost into farm economics reduced the annual returns by up to $39 ha−1, but the optimal fertiliser application rates remain the same. 5) Optimising N fertiliser rates to soil N and rainfall conditions increased the annual returns by up to $303 ha−1, with a further increase of $15 ha−1 from fertiliser use efficiency when the Australian Government incentives under the $2.55 billion dollar Emission Reduction Fund program was considered. These findings suggest that N-fertiliser application rates and N2O emission mitigation strategies need further refinements specific to prevailing soil and climate variabilities.

N1  - Water for Sustainable Socio-Economic Development, Good Health for All and Gender Equity
N2  - Resource-poor smallholder farmers in the semi-arid Gwanda and Beitbridge districts face food insecurity on an annual basis due to a combination of poor and erratic rainfall (average 500mm/a and 345mm/a, respectively, for the period 1970–2003) and technologies inappropriate to their resource status. This impacts on both household livelihoods and food security. In an attempt to improve food security in the catchment a number of drip kit distribution programmes have been initiated since 2003 as part of an on-going global initiative aimed at 2 million poor households per year. A number of recent studies have assessed the technical performance of the drip kits in-lab and in-field. In early 2005 a study was undertaken to assess the impacts and sustainability of the drip kit programme. Representatives of the NGOs, local government, traditional leadership and agricultural extension officers were interviewed. Focus group discussions with beneficiaries and other villagers were held at village level. A survey of 114 households was then conducted in two districts, using a questionnaire developed from the output of the interviews and focus group discussions. The results from the study showed that the NGOs did not specifically target the distribution of the drip kits to poor members of the community (defined for the purpose of the study as those not owning cattle). Poor households made up 54% of the beneficiaries. This poor targeting of vulnerable households could have been a result of conditions set by some implementing NGOs that beneficiaries must have an assured water source. On the other hand, only 2% of the beneficiaries had used the kit to produce the expected 5 harvests over the 2 years, owing to problems related to water shortage, access to water and also pests and diseases. About 51% of the respondents had produced at least 3 harvests and 86% produced at least 2 harvests. Due to water shortages during the dry season 61% of production with the drip kit occurred during the wet season. This suggests that most households use the drip kits as supplementary irrigation. Conflicts between beneficiaries and water point committees or other water users developed in some areas especially during the dry season. The main finding from this study was that low cost drip kit programs can only be a sustainable intervention if implemented as an integral part of a long-term development program, not short-term relief programs and the programme should involve a broad range of stakeholders. A first step in any such program, especially in water scarce areas such as Gwanda and Beitbridge, is a detailed analysis of the existing water resources to assess availability and potential conflicts, prior to distribution of drip kits.

N2  - With a rapidly growing urban population in Kumasi, Ghana, the consumption of street food is increasing. Raw salads, which often accompany street food dishes, are typically composed of perishable vegetables that are grown in close proximity to the city using poor quality water for irrigation. This study assessed the risk of gastroenteritis illness (caused by rotavirus, norovirus and Ascaris lumbricoides) associated with the consumption of street food salads using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). Three different risk assessment models were constructed, based on availability of microbial concentrations: 1) Water — starting from irrigation water quality, 2) Produce — starting from the quality of produce at market, and 3) Street — using microbial quality of street food salad. In the absence of viral concentrations, published ratios between faecal coliforms and viruses were used to estimate the quality of water, produce and salad, and annual disease burdens were determined. Rotavirus dominated the estimates of annual disease burden (~10−3Disability Adjusted Life Years per person per year (DALYs pppy)), although norovirus also exceeded the 10−4DALY threshold for both Produce and Street models. The Water model ignored other on-farm and post-harvest sources of contamination and consistently produced lower estimates of risk; it likely underestimates disease burden and therefore is not recommended. Required log reductions of up to 5.3 (95th percentile) for rotavirus were estimated for the Street model, demonstrating that significant interventions are required to protect the health and safety of street food consumers in Kumasi. Estimates of virus concentrations were a significant source of model uncertainty and more data on pathogen concentrations is needed to refine QMRA estimates of disease burden.

N2  - This chapter provides a review of spending needs to achieve sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 targets based on five recent global cost studies. The focus of these costing exercises has been on water, sanitation, and hygiene (SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2), while fewer studies cover water pollution reduction, water efficiency measures, water management, water for ecosystems, irrigation, and flood protection. Global costs of achieving SDG 6 exceed US$ 1 trillion annually, while only a fraction of this amount is currently being spent to close the service gap. Future cost studies need to be accompanied by strategies to close the financing gap, and greater focus is needed at national and subnational levels to enable important specificities in programming and technology needs. Studies need to quantify the impact of emerging challenges, such as climate change, and to identify the full range of potential financing sources.

N1  - Substainable planning in a semi-arid fast growing region
N2  - A large scale ecosystem restoration program was initiated in 1997 on the Pecos River in Western Texas. Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.), a non-native invasive tree, had created a near monoculture along the banks of the river by replacing most native vegetation. Local irrigation districts, private landowners, federal and state agencies, and private industry worked together to formulate and implement a restoration plan, with a goal of reducing the effects of saltcedar and restoring the native ecosystem of the river. An initial management phase utilizing state-of-the-art aerial application of herbicide began in 1999 and continued through 2003. Initial mortality of saltcedar averaged about 85–90%. Monitoring efforts were initiated at the onset of the project to include evaluating the effects of saltcedar control on salinity of the river water, efficiency of water delivery down the river as an irrigation water source, and estimates of water salvage. To date, no effect on salinity can be measured and irrigation delivery was suspended in 2002–2003 due to drought conditions. Water salvage estimates show a significant reduction in system water loss after saltcedar treatment. However, a flow increase in the river is not yet evident. Monitoring efforts will continue in subsequent years.

N2  - The Mediterranean region has always shown a marked inter-annual
variability in seasonal weather, creating uncertainty in decisional
processes of cultivation and livestock breeding that should not be
neglected when modeling farmers' adaptive responses. This is especially
relevant when assessing the impact of climate change (CC), which
modifies the atmospheric variability and generates new uncertainty
conditions, and the possibility of adaptation of agriculture. Our
analysis examines this aspect reconstructing the effects of inter-annual
climate variability in a diversified farming district that well
represents a wide range of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems in
the Mediterranean area. We used a Regional Atmospheric Modelling System
and a weather generator to generate 150 stochastic years of the present
and near future climate. Then, we implemented calibrated crop and
livestock models to estimate the corresponding productive responses in
the form of probability distribution functions (PDFs) under the two
climatic conditions. We assumed these PDFs able to represent the
expectations of farmers in a discrete stochastic programming (DSP) model
that reproduced their economic behaviour under uncertainty conditions.
The comparison of the results in the two scenarios provided an
assessment of the impact of CC, also taking into account the possibility
of adjustment allowed by present technologies and price regimes. The DSP
model is built in blocks that represent the farm typologies operating in
the study area, each one with its own resource endowment, decisional
constraints and economic response. Under this latter aspect, major
differences emerged among farm typologies and sub-zones of the study
area. A crucial element of differentiation was water availability, since
only irrigated C3 crops took full advantage from the fertilization
effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. Rainfed crop
production was depressed by the expected reduction of spring rainfall
associated to the higher temperatures. So, a dualism emerges between the
smaller impact on crop production in the irrigated plain sub-zone,
equipped with collective water networks and abundant irrigation
resources, and the major negative impact in the hilly area, where these
facilities and resources are absent. However intensive dairy farming was
also negatively affected in terms of milk production and quality, and
cattle mortality because of the increasing summer temperatures. This
provides explicit guidance for addressing strategic adaptation policies
and for framing farmers' perception of CC, in order to help them to
develop an awareness of the phenomena that are already in progress,
which is a prerequisite for effective adaptation responses. (C) 2016

N1  - Integrated Water Resources Management - From Concept to Practice
N2  - The measurement of chemical, physical and biological parameters is important for the characterization of streams health. Thus, cost-effective and targeted water quality (WQ) monitoring programmes are required for proper assessment, restoration and protection of such systems. This research proposes a WQ monitoring network for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) in Mozambique located in Southern Africa, a region prone to severe droughts. In this Basin both anthropogenic and natural driven processes, exacerbated by the increased water demand by the four riparian countries (Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique) are responsible for the degradation of surface waters, impairing their downstream use, either for aquatic ecosystem, drinking, industrial or irrigation. Hence, physico-chemical, biological and microbiological characteristics at 23 sites within the basin were studied in November 2006 and January 2007. The physico-chemical and microbiological samples were analyzed according to American Public Health Association (APHA) standard methods, while the biological monitoring working party method (BMWP) was used for biological assessment. The assessment of the final WQ condition at sampled points was done taking into account appropriate indexes, the Mozambican standards for receiving waters and the WHO guidelines for drinking WQ. The assessed data indicated that sites located at proximities to the border with upstream countries were contaminated with heavy metals. The Elephants subcatchment was found with a relatively better WQ, whereas the Changane subcatchment together with the effluent point discharges in the basin were found polluted as indicated by the low dissolved oxygen and high total dissolved solids, electric conductivity, total hardness, sodium adsorption ratio and low benthic macroinvertebrates taxa. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found for some parameters when the concentrations recorded in November and January were tested, therefore, indicating possible need for monthly monitoring of WQ. From this study it was concluded that a systematic WQ monitoring network composed of 16 stations would fit the conditions of the LRB. Ambient, earl warning, operational and effluents are the main monitoring types recommended. Additional research at a Basin scale was also recommended to identify the major sources of pollution, their transport and impacts to the downstream ecosystem.

N2  - Enteric bacterial pathogen levels can influence the suitability of irrigation water sources for fruits and vegetables. We hypothesize that stable spatial patterns of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes levels may exist across surface water sources in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. Water samples were collected at four streams and two pond sites in the mid-Atlantic U.S. over 2 years, biweekly during the fruit and vegetable growing seasons, and once a month during nongrowing seasons. Two stream sites and one pond site had significantly different mean concentrations in growing and nongrowing seasons. Stable spatial patterns were determined for relative differences between the site concentrations and average concentration of both pathogens across the study area. Mean relative differences were significantly different from zero at four of the six sites for S. enterica and three of six sites for L. monocytogenes. There was a similarity between the mean relative difference distribution between sites over growing season, nongrowing season, and the entire observation period. Mean relative differences were determined for temperature, oxidation-reduction potential, specific electrical conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and cumulative rainfall. A moderate-to-strong Spearman correlation (rs > 0.657) was found between spatial patterns of S. enterica and 7-day rainfall, and between relative difference patterns of L. monocytogenes and temperature (rs = 0.885) and dissolved oxygen (rs = -0.885). Persistence in ranking sampling sites by the concentrations of the two pathogens was also observed. Finding spatially stable patterns in pathogen concentrations highlights spatiotemporal dynamics of these microorganisms across the study area can facilitate the design of an effective microbial water quality monitoring program for surface irrigation water.

N2  - A risk-based interval-stochastic optimization modelling approach is developed for agricultural water allocation in response to the complexity arising from uncertainties and risk in agricultural water management systems. The approach comprises conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) model, inexact two-stage stochastic programming (ITSP) model with imprecise probabilities (IPs), and random-boundary intervals (RBIs) within a general framework. The approach can simultaneously balance expected benefits, penalties, and risks from agricultural water allocation, and can address uncertainties of agricultural water supply and demand in the form of probability distributions and intervals with random boundaries. As demonstrated in Hulan River irrigation area, northeast China, the objective of the approach is to allocate limited agricultural water resources to make a trade-off between various subareas under different risk-aversion levels and possible runoff discharges. Most inputs to the approach are expressed as interval numbers that are generated by statistical simulation, based on which various agricultural water allocation schemes are obtained. Irrigation water performance based on the optimal results are also analyzed. Results validate the applicability of the approach incorporating multiple uncertainties and risk-aversion measures in optimization models, and generating agricultural water allocation schemes in the form of interval numbers.

N2  - The goal to improve food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) through domestic, resource efficient and low carbon agriculture is importance. Interventions to produce more food could impact the resource-base and lead to increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agroecosystems. Unfortunately, existing methods are limited in analyzing small-scale agricultural systems, and this situation is an obstacle to decision making which aims at sustainable agriculture. In this paper, we showcase the recently developed Emergy-Data Envelopment Analysis (EM-DEA) approach to assess the resource use efficiency (RUE) and sustainability in maize production systems in Ghana, SSA. Using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), five land use and resource management scenarios were modeled to represent practices as decision making units (DMUs) in small-scale maize systems. The carbon footprint of the systems was assessed using an approach, which we adapted from the FAO Ex-Ante Carbon balance Tool (EX-ACT). The overall trend of the results showed that the yield, total emergy, GHG emissions and carbon footprint all increased with increase in urea application intensity. However, the relationship between the yield and urea intensity was not always linear. A system that used more renewable or fewer resources to produce a yield equal to that of its peer was considered more efficient and sustainable in relative terms. In particular, the business-as-usual scenario (12 kg/ha/yr NPK input to rainfed maize system, i.e. Extensive12) was inefficient when compared to the four contrasting scenarios. The ecological intensive scenario (20 kg/ha/yr urea input to rainfed maize-legume intercropping system, i.e. Intercrop20) achieved the greatest marginal yield, better RUE and sustainability. The high input scenario (100 kg/ha/yr urea input plus supplemental irrigation to maize monoculture, i.e. Intensive100) produced the greatest yield, but the demand for purchased inputs as well as GHG emissions and carbon footprint were greatest. The no external input scenario (0 kg/ha/yr urea input to rainfed maize system, i.e. Extensive0), and the moderate input scenario (50 kg/ha/yr urea input plus supplemental irrigation to maize monoculture, i.e. Intensive50) showed the greatest and least yield gaps relative to Intensive100, respectively. Based on these results and trade-off analysis, it was evident that Intercrop20 and Intensive50 were the two best case scenarios. As such, land use policy that aims at sustainable agriculture could recommend Intercrop20 and Intensive50 for implementation in low and high input maize production systems, respectively. Comparison between our results and other existing empirical studies revealed similarities that confirm our results. We conclude that the information derived using the EM-DEA and EX-ACT approaches could be useful when making informed decisions that aim at sustainable agriculture. Despite the limitation caused by scarcity of data, the use of the EM-DEA approach led to inclusive information on RUE and sustainability of the DMUs. Hence, the EM-DEA approach represents a way forward to better assess energy footprint in agricultural land use as a whole.

N2  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important food legume, cultivated by small farmers and is usually exposed to unfavorable conditions with minimum use of inputs. Drought and low soil fertility, especially phosphorus and nitrogen (N) deficiencies, are major limitations to bean yield in smallholder systems. Beans can derive part of their required N from the atmosphere through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). Drought stress severely limits SNF ability of plants. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) test and validate the use of 15N natural abundance in grain to quantify phenotypic differences in SNF ability for its implementation in breeding programs of common bean with bush growth habit aiming to improve SNF, and (ii) quantify phenotypic differences in SNF under drought to identify superior genotypes that could serve as parents. Field studies were conducted at CIAT-Palmira, Colombia using a set of 36 bean genotypes belonging to the Middle American gene pool for evaluation in two seasons with two levels of water supply (irrigated and drought stress). We used 15N natural abundance method to compare SNF ability estimated from shoot tissue sampled at mid-pod filling growth stage vs. grain tissue sampled at harvest. Our results showed positive and significant correlation between nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) estimated using shoot tissue at mid-pod filling and %Ndfa estimated using grain tissue at harvest. Both methods showed phenotypic variability in SNF ability under both drought and irrigated conditions and a significant reduction in SNF ability was observed under drought stress. We suggest that the method of estimating Ndfa using grain tissue (Ndfa-G) could be applied in bean breeding programs to improve SNF ability. Using this method of Ndfa-G, we identified four bean lines (RCB 593, SEA 15, NCB 226 and BFS 29) that combine greater SNF ability with greater grain yield under drought stress and these could serve as potential parents to further improve SNF ability of common bean.

N2  - Freshwater sustainability has been emerging as a critical corporate social responsibility issue for leading businesses worldwide. An increasing number of companies disclose and evaluate their water footprint, embracing an end-to-end supply chain perspective. In this work, we first propose a strategic system dynamics model for capturing the long-term impact of various water management policies on consumptive water footprint and supply chain profitability under diverse scenarios of consumers' demand patterns depending on blue water-related efficiency (i.e. green market behaviours). We apply the proposed simulation model on a specific wine supply chain and demonstrate that, under specific green market behaviour conditions, technological interventions in agriculture (e.g. drip irrigation) are more environmentally and economically sustainable compared to industrial water recycling and reuse, while the combined application of both policies is even more effective. Additionally, the impact of water-efficient policies on supply chain financial performance is even more potent under increased consumers' environmental sensitivity. Based on the managerial insights obtained from our analysis, as well as current corporate drivers and goals, we finally propose a supporting methodological framework for the ex-ante evaluation of eco-efficient supply chain water management policies, considering the impact of the green market behaviour on water-related and economic sustainability.

N2  - Groundwater (GW) depletion and recurring floods have become a major concern among researchers and planners across the world. To rejuvenate stressed aquifer and moderate flood impacts, a modified version of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) consisting of a cluster of ten recharge wells (RWs) embedded in a community pond with an area of 2625 m2 and utilizing diverted floodwater was tested on a pilot scale in Ramganga sub basin, India. The approach could recharge a maximum of 72426 m3 of floodwater in 78 days during the wet season. The pond intervention minimized clogging of RWs by retaining maximum silt load of 68.01%. Hydro-geochemically, majority of water samples were of Mg-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3type. Ion exchange processes and weathering of carbonate and silicates were the controlling factors, determining water quality of the area. Total dissolved solids, fluoride, iron, zinc, manganese, chromium, cobalt, nickel, mercury, phosphate, nitrate, and ammonical nitrogen were found within the permissible limits as laid down by World Health Organization except arsenic and lead, which seems to be the inherent problem in the area, as evidenced by water quality analysis of farmers tube wells located upstream and down streams of the recharge site. The coliform presence in the 88.23% of sampled GW may thwart from direct use for drinking whereas it was fit for irrigation. Looking the benefits of modified MAR as a proactive GW quality improvement with good aquifer recharge, it is recommended for scaling up of the intervention across the GW stressed parts of the whole Ram Ganga basin and similar hydro-geological regions elsewhere.

N2  - The main objective of this study was to assess the combining ability for rice grain quality to recognize the most desirable genotypes for rice breeding programs. A half diallel cross was made among eight rice genotypes. The obtained 28 F1 and their parents were evaluated in two separate irrigation experiments; the first experiment was irrigated every four days (normal condition). The second experiment was irrigated every ten days (a stress condition). The two experiments were designed in randomized complete block design with three replications. The results indicated that water deficit treatment significantly reduced all the studied traits except for amylose content % was increased under stressed treatments. General combining ability mean squares were highly significant for all the studied features except gelatinization temperature under drought irrigation. Specific combining ability mean squares were highly significant for grain elongation % under both conditions and amylose content % under water deficit; this indicates the importance of additive and non-additive genetic effects in the inheritance of these traits. Two crosses, Sakha106 × Sakha107 and Sakha106 × Sakha108 had the highest desirable mean values for hulling (%), milling (%), head rice, and gelatinization temperature, also lowest amylose content under both conditions. Three crosses, Giza 179 X Sakha 107, Giza 179 X Sakha 108, and Sakha 106 X Sakha 108, had the highest mean values of grain elongation % under both conditions. The cross Sakha107 × sakha108 showed highly significant positive desirable SCA effects for hulling (%) milling (%) gelatinization temperature and grain elongation. The varieties Sakha 107 and Sakha108 were the best general combiners and could be used in breeding programs for improving all the studied traits under both conditions.

N2  - Linear programming (LP) has been widely used to solve company resource allocation problems. The technique's ability to predict how companies will adjust to changes in a variety of exogenous factors is well known, and when used at company level, it enables us to avoid aggregation problems. The decision-maker's objective in this type of research is to maximize profit estimated as gross margin. We apply the LP model to three farms in three different irrigation units that, we believe, provide a representative sample of Spanish irrigated agriculture. In focusing on the goals of this research we stress that water pricing as a single instrument for control of water use is not a valid means of significantly reducing agricultural water consumption. This is because consumption does not fall until prices reach such a level that farm income and agricultural employment are negatively affected. If water pricing is selected as a policy tool, among the consequences for agricultural sector will be that: farm income will decrease by around 40% before water demand decreases significantly. The impact of this reduction on rural areas that are dependent on irrigated agriculture will be catastrophic. Secondly there will be a reduction in the number of crops available for farming, with the consequence of a smaller number of alternatives and greater technical and economic vulnerability of the agricultural sector. Finally when water consumption decreases as a consequence of substitution of crops with higher demands for water (cotton, sugar beet, onions, corn) there will be a significant loss of employment both directly on farms and indirectly on processing facilities. These conclusions are drawn from our analysis of three irrigation units in Spain, but we believe that they offer a realistic estimate of policy impacts on the irrigated sector of Spanish agriculture. Even if price increases are not a suitable policy because of the high negative impact, we suggest that a price (around 2 PTAs/m3) might be of interest in order to make farmers aware of the scarcity of water resources, and to induce them to adopt water-saving technologies without affecting crop distribution. To make water pricing work properly under Spanish conditions, the revenues should be administered by “Comunidades de Regantes” for investment in environmental and water-saving activities, while revenues that are not appropriately invested could be transferred to the Regional Water Authority.

N2  - We analyze the implications of switching from existing seniority-based allocations to proportional water sharing policies in times of water shortage in the Bow River Sub-Basin in Southern Alberta. In particular, we simulate three variations of the proportional water sharing concept: (1) irrigation districts’ permissible diversions are reduced in proportion to each district's licenced allocations; (2) the diversions are reduced in proportion with each district's past five-year average diversions; and (3) the diversions are reduced proportionately with each district's diversion in a single prior year. Compared to the seniority-based allocations, all three alternative policies produce unambiguously better results. With trades, the prospect of overall economic gain improves further. However, the distribution of potential monetary gains varies across scenarios.

N2  - Water markets are water management instruments that can support water reallocation from low to high value agricultural uses. However, unless explicit consideration is given to water uses not directly involved in the trading (e.g. environment), water markets may fail to promote sustainable growth. In inter-basin water markets, the reallocation of water withdrawal entitlements from the selling basin typically involves the reallocation of return flows (the surface and subsurface water that leaves the agricultural system following withdrawal of irrigation water) along with consumptive uses, which may impair environmental flows and affect water uses downstream in the selling basin. This paper couples, using a sequential modular approach, a Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming (PMAUP) tool that models the behavior of irrigators and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) eco-hydrologic model to: i) assess the economic and water reallocation potential of a return flow-neutral inter-basin water market; and ii) explore the trading-return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle. Methods are applied to the case of agricultural water markets in the Tagus-Segura interconnected basins in Spain. Results show that enforcing a return flow-neutral water market can reduce returns from trade by up to EUR 1.63 per m3 of conserved streamflow.

N2  - In arid and semi-arid regions, improper irrigation activities not only exacerbate water shortages, but also lead to environmental pollution such as soil salinization that hinders crop growth and agricultural sustainability. There has been a lack of agricultural water management tools that could support agricultural water management with salinization-related grey water footprints being considered and associated uncertainties being addressed. In this study, salinization-related grey water footprints were measured through accounting for relationships among irrigation, soil salinity, evapotranspiration and crop yield, and then incorporated into an agricultural water management model for supporting environmentally sound irrigation decisions. Such an agricultural water management model was also characterized by a newly proposed generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming (GFIFP) method that could address ratio problems of two objectives and dual uncertainties. The developed methodology coupling the GFIFP method and grey water footprints was applied to an irrigation region in northwestern China where water scarcity and soil salinization hindered local development. Five credibility levels corresponding to decision makers' varied satisfactory degrees over water availability, and nine weight coefficients of possibility and necessity measures were considered. Results showed that, in order to reduce negative environmental impacts while increasing economic benefits, more irrigation water should be allocated to wheat and sunflower rather than corn. When the credibility level is 0.5 and weight coefficient is 0.9, the system efficiency would be the highest. Compared to the benchmark year of 2018, this scenario would generate [0.330, 6.647] billion yuan more benefits and [16.0, 133.9] million m3 less grey water footprints. Compared to three conventional approaches, GFIFP could provide decisions with more flexibility and less environmental impacts. The developed approach could also be applied to agricultural water management problems in other areas aiming at reducing grey water footprints and enhancing environmental benefits under uncertainty.

N2  - A pesticide prioritization approach was developed and implemented in the Pinios River Basin of Central Greece. It takes under consideration the Level of Environmental Risk containing information on the frequency of occurrence of pesticides above environmental thresholds, the intensity of this occurrence and the spatial distribution as well as information about the fate and behavior of pesticides in the environment and the potential to have adverse impact on humans' health. Original 3-year monitoring data from 102 Stationary Sampling Sites located on rivers and their tributaries, reservoirs, streams and irrigation/drainage canals giving rise to a collection of 2382 water samples resulting in 7088 data sets, were included in this integrated prioritization study. Among 302 monitored active ingredients, 119 were detected at least once and the concentrations found in the aquatic systems for 41% of compounds were higher than the respective lowest Predicted Non-Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. Sixteen and 5 pesticides were found with risk ratios (MECmax/PNEC) above 10 (high concern) and 100 (very high concern), respectively. However, pesticides with maximum Measured Environmental Concentration (MECmax) values exceeding by 1000 times the respective lowest PNEC values were also found which were considered of extremely high concern; in the latter group were included prometryn, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, λ-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, α-cypermethrin deltamethrin, ethalfluralin and phosmet. The sensitivity of the analytical methods used in the monitoring study was considered inadequate to meet the toxicological endpoints for 32 pesticides. The widest distribution of occurrence in the Stationary Sampling Sites of the monitoring program was found for the pesticides, prometryn, fluometuron, terbuthylazine, S-metolachlor, chlorpyrifos, diphenylamine, acetochlor, alachlor, 2,4-D, etridiazole, imidacloprid and lindane (γ-ΗCH). Among the 27 priority pesticides included in the Directive 2013/39/EU, in the present study 13 pesticides were considered as candidates for River Basin Specific Pollutants (RBSP) for the River Basin of Pinios. Among the 30 pesticide specific pollutants that were established by the Greek authorities, in the present study only 6 were considered as candidates for RBSP for the river basin of Pinios. As a result of the implementation of the prioritization approach developed in this study a total of 71 pesticides were identified as being RBSP for the river basin of Pinios. The higher Level of Environmental Risk was found to be exerted by the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos, followed by lindane and prometryn. The present study provides background information for important decisions to be made concerning the selection of pesticides which should be included in the target analyte list of new monitoring and screening programs of surface water quality in the Pinios River Basin. In addition, the prioritization approach proposed here can be useful for the development of River Basin Management Plans.

N2  - β-Carotene rich orange-fleshed sweet potatoes are increasingly used in community-based interventions aimed at addressing vitamin A deficiency, but are often cultivated in marginal soils and with sub-optimal agricultural inputs. The aim of the study was to determine (i) β-carotene content, β-carotene yield and water productivity at increments of water application, and, (ii) β-carotene content and β-carotene yield at increments of chemical fertilizer application for orange-fleshed sweet potato in separate field trials. β-Carotene content at the low irrigation treatment was between 15 and 34% higher than at optimal irrigation treatment. Increased water application brought about a two-fold increase in β-carotene yield per unit area. The best combination of β-carotene yield and water productivity (g β-carotene ha−1mm−1 water applied) was achieved at the intermediate (60%) irrigation treatment. Calculations showed that 1ha of orange-fleshed sweet potato produced at the intermediate water application at yield level of 24.6–28.4tha−1, can potentially provide 452–730 households (of six persons) with an adequate amount of vitamin A over a period of 180days. β-Carotene content was 14% higher for both intermediate (50%) and high (100%) fertilizer treatments, compared to the 0% fertilizer treatment. β-Carotene yield increased two-fold at the intermediate and four-fold at the high fertilization treatment. This paper provides novel information on the effect of irrigation on β-carotene yield, as well as β-carotene water productivity in orange-fleshed sweet potato. Follow-up research on a range of varieties is suggested toward obtaining recommendations for broad application in vitamin A crop-based interventions to optimize the β-carotene yield in orange-fleshed sweet potato.

N2  - The instability of irrigation reservoir bank slopes in cold regions has seriously affected the benign development of irrigation areas and agricultural production in recent years. To predict and evaluate the slope failure caused by freeze-thaw cycles, a two-dimensional numerical model of thermo-hydro-mechanical multi physical fields of a reservoir soil bank slope is established based on field investigations, laboratory tests and prototype observations. The relationship between the sliding surface temperature and the soil mechanical parameters is proposed by a secondary development program. The generation of the cracks on the bank slope top is explained from the viewpoint of temperature. The hydrothermal changing process of the bank slope under the external temperature is analyzed and compared with the measured data. The long-term degradation process of the soil bank slope under freeze-thaw cycles is studied, and the evolution law of its safety factors with the hydrothermal variation at the sliding surface is quantitatively revealed. The results show that the freeze-thaw cycles have an obvious accelerating effect on the soil bank slope instability, and the safety factor is decreased by 10.43% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles, which directly leads to the bank slope failure

N2  - Livelihood vulnerability in environmentally fragile areas is emerging as a key issue due to its positive feedback to environmental degradation. Assessment of sustainable livelihoods is a crucial prerequisite for targeting interventions. However, aggregated analysis usually obtained ambiguous conclusions because they ignored the heterogeneity of rural households. Here, we evaluated the livelihood sustainability of different rural households by constructing an improved Livelihood Sustainability Index (LSI) in hilly red soil erosion areas of southern China. Changting County was selected as the study case by virtue of its unique representativeness in soil erosion and poverty. The results showed that livelihood sustainability among rural households was far from equivalent. Different from previous studies, higher nonfarm income share was not always consistent with higher extent of livelihood sustainability. Besides nonfarm employment, agricultural specialization could be another viable pathway to attain sustainable livelihoods. We also found that intergenerational sustainability was one primary cause for long-term livelihood differentiation of rural households. The poor education in rural areas would aggravate livelihood vulnerability of the poor and threaten the sustainable livelihoods of specialized agricultural households. Policy implications include further investment in rural infrastructure, irrigation and drainage, and stimulus for land transfer and concentration to facilitate agrarian specialization; enhancing investment in rural education to improve intergenerational sustainability; as well as targeting of the most vulnerable households, for example, promoting development of social insurance, social relief, and medical services for orphans and widows.

N2  - The Hai Basin in China exemplifies problems that are observed in many arid environments: excessive water consumption, depletion of aquifers, and damage to eco-systems. Progressively since the 1970s water resources in Hai Basin have been over-exploited, primarily for irrigation, while the water requirements of other sectors have increased. Water tables are falling and outflows to the sea are sporadic and heavily polluted. Current consumption of water in the basin is estimated to exceed the renewable supply from rainfall by 6.25×109m3yr−1. Traditional approaches—improving irrigation efficiency through structural works and on-farm technologies such as drip and sprinkler—have failed to restore a balance. Researchers have investigated various on-farm techniques to reduce consumption, including mulching, zero tillage, deficit irrigation, revised cropping patterns, and improved cultivars. We project the results of such experiments for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and cotton (Gossypium spp.) to basin scale to assess their potential in restoring sustainable water consumption. Widespread adoption of mulching, which is the most promising option for farmers, would reduce the over-consumption by 25% (1.6×109m3yr−1). If water quotas are introduced, forcing a reduction in consumption, current production could be maintained while saving 4.1×109m3yr−1. Ending the remaining over-consumption of 2.15×109m3yr−1 would require reducing grain production by 4–7.8Mtyr−1.

N2  - Increased longevity of leaves, or improved leaf retention, has been suggested as a possible means to increase productivity of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). This study evaluated variation in leaf retention and its relation to cassava productivity under irrigated and stressed conditions. In the first trial 1350 clones were evaluated on the North Coast of Colombia with a 5-month dry period towards the end of the growth cycle. Clones with the leaf retention trait produced more total fresh biomass and yielded 33% more root dry matter than plants without the trait. In the irrigated trial 110 clones were evaluated on the CIAT farm at about 1000 mamsl. Leaf retention was quantified using a 1–5 visual score with five corresponding to excellent leaf retention. Genetic correlations between leaf retention and fresh foliage production (0.49), root dry matter yield (0.46), fresh root production (0.43) and root dry matter content (0.25) were obtained. Increased root yield under stressed and unstressed conditions was associated with increased total biomass production and increased harvest index. These finding concur with the results of cassava growth models that include leaf longevity as a variable. The lack of any negative genetic correlations between leaf retention and useful agronomic traits coupled with the relatively high genetic correlation for root yield and the high heritability (0.55) for leaf retention indicate that it should be relatively easy and advantageous to incorporate this characteristic in breeding and selection programs directed to increasing root yield under both water stressed and unstressed conditions.

N2  - To respond to climate impact, poor agricultural households in less developed regions rely on different types of assets that define their overall adaptive capacity (AC). However not all assets build capacity equally. In this study we argue that building AC requires a combination of interventions that address not only climate-related risks (specific capacity) but also the structural deficits (e.g., lack of income, education, health, political power) (generic capacity) that shape vulnerability. Focusing on rainfed agriculture in NE Brazil, we investigate how households leverage and combine generic and specific capacities to reduce vulnerability. Particularly we explore: 1) the relative importance of different kinds of capacity in shaping vulnerability on these households and 2) how the level of generic capacities (particularly as a result of Brazil’s anti-poverty program Bolsa Família) influences the adoption of specific ones. We find that both kinds of capacity matter, as relatively higher levels of generic capacity (in terms of income in general, and climate-neutral income specifically) are associated with higher levels of specific capacity (irrigation). In addition we find that while Bolsa Família has been positive in increasing income, it has not been sufficient to manage the risk of food insecurity during drought events, suggesting a 'poverty trap' in which families are constantly coping with drought but failing to overcome the conditions that make them vulnerable. Our findings indicate that in order to decrease climate vulnerability of poor agricultural households, development interventions, such as anti-poverty programs, have to go beyond cash transfer and should incorporate risk management policies that enhance synergies between generic and specific capacities.

N2  - Energy and water resources systems are tightly coupled; energy is needed to deliver water and water is needed to extract or produce energy. Growing pressure on these resources has raised concerns about their long-term management and highlights the need to develop integrated solutions. A method for joint optimization of water and electric power systems was developed in order to identify methodologies to assess the broader interactions between water and energy systems. The proposed method is to include water users and power producers into an economic optimization problem that minimizes the cost of power production and maximizes the benefits of water allocation, subject to constraints from the power and hydrological systems. The method was tested on the Iberian Peninsula using simplified models of the seven major river basins and the power market. The optimization problem was successfully solved using stochastic dual dynamic programming. The results showed that current water allocation to hydropower producers in basins with high irrigation productivity, and to irrigation users in basins with high hydropower productivity was sub-optimal. Optimal allocation was achieved by managing reservoirs in very distinct ways, according to the local inflow, storage capacity, hydropower productivity, and irrigation demand and productivity. This highlights the importance of appropriately representing the water users’ spatial distribution and marginal benefits and costs when allocating water resources optimally. The method can handle further spatial disaggregation and can be extended to include other aspects of the water-energy nexus.

N2  - Numerous wildlife species are known pests of California agriculture. Effective management of these pests is required to maximize agricultural production, yet it is unclear how the importance of various wildlife pest species and associated management strategies may vary regionally throughout California. Accounting for these regional differences should yield management programs that are specifically tailored to the regions constituents and should be considered when managing wildlife pests at a more localized level. Therefore, we developed a survey to provide quantitative data on regional differences in research and management needs to better guide future research efforts in developing more effective, practical, and appropriate methods for managing wildlife pests. We found that coyotes were a more common pest in the mountain region, ground squirrels were a greater concern in the central and desert valley region, while birds were most commonly listed as pests by individuals working in multiple regions of California. Coyote damage varied regionally, with livestock depredation the greatest concern throughout most of California, although damage to irrigation tubing and sprinklers was of equal concern in the central and desert valley region. For bird pests, exclusionary devices were the most common and most effective methods of control in the coastal region. Frightening devices were the most commonly used method for bird control in all other regions, although the efficacy associated with frightening devices was considered far lower than their level of use, suggesting that better management options are needed for bird control in these regions. For all wildlife pests, nonlethal control options (e.g., exclusionary devices, habitat modification) were generally preferred in the coastal region while lethal removal options ranked higher in the central and desert valley region (e.g., baiting, burrow fumigation). Efficacy was considered the most important attribute of a control method for all regions, while Integrated Pest Management programs were considered the most effective method for controlling wildlife pests in all regions except for the central and desert valley region. Collectively, the importance of wildlife pests and the perception of associated control methods varied throughout California and reflects the need to consider these regional differences in order to optimize damage management strategies at the regional level.

N2  - A key objective of the land reforms in South Africa was for the process to lead to the emergence of a cohort of black small-scale commercial farmers who would realize substantive agricultural production levels through irrigation and actively contribute to the local and national agricultural value chains. The available evidence suggests that this objective has been difficult to attain and the contribution of land reform to livelihoods of the beneficiaries has been negligible in the Limpopo province. This study deployed qualitative research methodologies to gather both secondary and empirical data that enabled analysis of the extent to which the land reform program has contributed to the livelihoods of small-scale emerging farmers in the surroundings of Bela-Bela Municipal Area, Limpopo Province. The study found out that financial resources are a big challenge, with most of the farmers being unable to raise the capital needed to invest in the farming enterprise. In addition, most of the ‘emerging farmers’ do not have the know-how and experience needed to run a commercial farm. Overall, the study enabled us to conclude that the land reform projects have not only had limited impact on the livelihoods of the majority of the beneficiaries, instead, the reforms have left the country-side facing a real risk of increasing food insecurity. This suggests that a wide-ranging programme of land reform is a necessary but not sufficient condition for meaningful transformation of the livelihoods of the households involved. More groundwork still needs to be done by government and other development agencies to ensure availability of proper post-land transfer support systems for the emerging farmers.

N2  - The Shiyang River Basin is a typical arid watershed in Northwest China. Scientific understanding of the driving mechanism of runoff change is the basis of scientific utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development. In this study, runoff changes at different time scales were analyzed for the period 1960–2018, and the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff were investigated in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River Basin (SRB). A combination of mutation analysis and human-designed analysis was adopted to divide the study period into the baseline period and the variation period. The Mann–Kendall test (M−K) and Double Mass Curve method (DMC) were used to detect abrupt changes and quantify the relative effects of climate change and human activities on runoff. The results reveal a significant declining trend in annual runoff on the whole in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB, and there was an obvious recovery trend after the implementation of the Comprehensive Treatment Program of the SRB (CTSRB) in 2007. Abrupt changes occurred in 1976, 1991 and 2007, which divided the study period into the baseline period (1960–1975), the Variation Ⅰ period (1976–1990), the Variation Ⅱ period (1991–2006) and the Variation III period (2007–2018). The contribution of human activities to runoff reduction was 88.72%, whereas the contribution of climate change to runoff reduction was only 11.28%. Furthermore, the contribution of human activities to runoff reduction in the Variation Ⅰ period, Variation Ⅱ period and Variation III period was 89.44%, 93.02% and 83.69%, respectively. Therefore, human activities played the most dominant role in the variation of runoff, followed by climate change and upstream runoff. Further analysis of the impact of human activities on runoff indicated that agricultural irrigation was the dominant factor of runoff reduction. This study can provide detailed information on water resources and a scientific basis for the development and utilization of water resources in the future.

N2  - Understanding the status of water-energy-food (WEF) Nexus, oriented to the whole process of water extraction and deployment, water consumption for crop growth, and food production output, in irrigation systems is essential for food security and resources sustainability. Based on WEF Nexus quantification, combining traditional agricultural water-saving and water footprint theory, the sustainable development level (SDL) of water acquisition-transfer-consumption process for pumped irrigation systems was analyzed, using the principal component analysis (PCA) and taking the Lianshui Irrigation District (LID) in eastern China as a case study, in this paper. The driving mechanism of SDL for WEF Nexus was revealed by virtue of the partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Results showed that, annual SDL of the WEF Nexus in the pumped irrigation systems was 0.3 during the study period 2005–2019, mainly due to the low SDLe and SDLf, indicating that sustainability had been concerned. PRE and RRI were significant-positive factors, while CDI functioned as significant-negative driving factors on SDL of WEF Nexus. The measures adjusting crop planting structure, transforming irrigation and drainage mode, updating water pump equipment, and increasing agricultural investment contribute to the sustainability of WEF Nexus in the observed irrigation systems. Therefore, the sustainable management can be implemented according to the unique driving factors identification of WEF Nexus in pumped irrigation systems. The research is conducive to the management and program for irrigated agricultural systems under the changing circumstances.

N2  - Summary
The optimization of conjunctive-use management models (with different competing demands, several reservoirs and aquifers, and a high interconnection among elements) over long time horizons requires the use of computationally-efficient groundwater flow models. A review of conjunctive use models and some methods applied to reduce the computational cost of the groundwater flow model has been performed, with special attention to the assumption of linear behaviour. The effect of considering invariant transmissivity in a conjunctive-use management model at the basin scale has been analyzed using as case study the Adra-Campo de Dalías system (Southeast of Spain). The system includes an unconfined aquifer not hydraulically connected to the river in which significant drawdown, relative to the saturated thickness, can appear. The basin scale system also includes storage in a reservoir, flows in several river segments and canals, and a second simpler aquifer. The management formulation seeks the best conjunctive operation of reservoir and aquifer to meet urban and irrigation demands while satisfying minimum flow and aquifer head constraints over a time horizon of several years. The effect of the linear assumption has been studied by comparing and analyzing management model results obtained modeling the aquifer as confined and as unconfined. Groundwater flow is simulated in the optimization model using the response matrix method. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming (SLP) in the unconfined case and using linear programming (LP) when confined behaviour is assumed. Although the drawdown are significant, the difference in results is minor, suggesting that the use of a linear assumption may be valid in many basin scale conjunctive management problems in which the aquifer is not hydraulically connected to the river system. Nevertheless, the assumption should be tested, if possible, in each management problem with unconfined aquifers in which significant drawdown appears.

N2  - Considering the importance of sustainable production practices with greater resource use efficiency, a study was conducted during 2009–12 to understand the soil properties, crop yield, and economics as affected by the integrated crop management (ICM) practices under the Bhoochetana (soil rejuvenation) program in Karnataka, India. Results from 3776 crop-cutting studies on different crops (cereals, pulses, and oilseeds) revealed that there is a vast spatial variability in case of various soil nutrients across different taluks of Karnataka. Balanced fertilizer application, both in rainfed and irrigated areas, directly influenced crop yields. Yields of cereals, legumes, and oilseeds were 3590, 1400, and 2230 kg ha−1 with improved management practices as compared to 2650, 1030, and 1650 kg ha−1 with conventional farming practices, respectively. Average net income estimated from conventional farming was Rs. 26,290 ha−1, while it was Rs. 35,540 ha−1 from improved management practices, which indicated that ICM practices resulted in an additional 35% income. The oilseeds performed better in terms of achieving higher net income and benefit–cost ratio while the cereals and legumes also have shown significant improvement in yield compared to the yields from conventional farming practices. The detailed findings on soil properties, yields of crops, and economics suggested that there is a vast potential for crop productivity improvement through ICM practices across different soil types and rainfall zones of Karnataka, India. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The Crop Water Use phone app is a weather-based program developed by the Missouri Extension Service to help farmers with irrigation scheduling. A limitation of the program is that it only works on Missouri fields. The app is linked to the state agricultural weather station network which supplies daily standardized, short-crop evapotranspiration (ETo). For farmers outside the network, the cost of installing and maintaining appropriately maintained weather stations is cost prohibitive. A less costly option would be to install atmometers within the field of interest. The objective of this study was to compare ETo data from atmometers to electronic weather stations with traditional sensors. In 2015 and 2016, electronic atmometers were installed at three locations in Missouri. Atmometers were placed near electronic weather stations programmed to calculate daily ETo. Each atmometer ceramic cup was fitted with a disposable paper wafer and #30 diffusion canvas cover and wired to an event data logger to record daily ETo measurements. Regression analysis showed a close relationship between ETo measured with atmometers and weather station across locations and years (R2=0.74). However, ETo from atmometers averaged 15% lower than weather stations. Regional or localized calibration equations may be required before using ETo from atmometers in irrigation scheduling apps, but additional research is needed to determine if the observed differences impact recommended irrigation intervals.

N2  - Semi-arid environments are strongly limited by water and nutrients, which hinders their recovery after anthropogenic disturbances. Application of compost and irrigation can improve soil fertility and enhance vegetation growth during the restoration of these environments. However, these restoration techniques may also favor the establishment of opportunistic communities and arrest natural succession. Mid and long-term assessments (>10 years) of the improvements in soil conditions and water availability after ecological restoration are scarce, although this is particularly important given the slow dynamics characterizing these environments. We assessed the effect of two levels of irrigation and compost addition (full-factorial design) in a limestone quarry under semi-arid conditions after a 13 years-period. These treatments were applied in addition to topsoiling, hydroseeding and plantation of woody species in the entire study area. Whereas the latter restoration treatments produced an overall increase in soil carbon content and salinity during this period (78% more soil carbon, over 200 μS/cm [nearly four times] more salinity), watering and compost addition did not affect the accumulation of soil organic carbon (at 0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) or soil salinity. In contrast to the observed short-term effects, water and compost addition did not affect the cover, biomass and diversity of the herbaceous layer, or the survival and growth of planted woody species 13 years after the treatments ended. Fading treatment effects occurred despite substantial changes in vegetation structure and composition between year 1 and year 13 (25% more herbaceous species, 13% less biomass, up to 80% decline in woody seedling survival). Conversely, similar to what we observed 13 years ago, the survival of woody plants was affected by the composition of the herbaceous layer, with species-specific responses to their cover and composition. Our study illustrates temporal shifts in the effects of two commonly applied restoration treatments, and highlights the need for mid- and long-term monitoring programs to properly assess the effectiveness of restoration actions.

N2  - Irrigation is the most impacting and uncertain human intervention on the water resource. The possibility of retrieving information on irrigation practices through remote sensing technology opens unprecedented perspectives on the monitoring of anthropized basins. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of different approaches to model the contribution of the evapotranspiration in retrieving the amounts of water applied for irrigation through a soil-moisture-based (SM-based) inversion algorithm; such a contribution is conclusive especially over semi-arid regions. Three modeling approaches relying on both calculated and remotely sensed actual and potential evapotranspiration (ET and PET) data sets were implemented to represent the evapotranspiration rate within the SM-based inversion method, which allows backward estimation of irrigation through the soil water balance inversion. By combining the different evapotranspiration data sources and modeling approaches, seven experiments aimed at inverting DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture at 1 km to estimate irrigation over four heavily irrigated agricultural districts located in Spain (Aragon and Catalonia) were compared. The results highlighted that the application of the FAO56 guidelines parametrization relying on the use of optical data as proposed by the authors in a previous study remains the most reliable configuration. In fact, the implementation of a simplified approach not considering the transpiration component of the specific crop led to irrigation underestimates. Finally, it is interesting to note that the application of the method with remotely sensed ET from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) produced reliable district-aggregated irrigation estimates, thus opening the perspective of an algorithm configuration forced with remote sensing data only.

N2  - Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., [syn. Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone]) is grown in the semi-arid tropics under climatically highly variable environmental conditions. To study the patterns of genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction and stability of grain yield and nutrient concentrations in Sudan, 225 pearl millet accessions were evaluated for yield performance at three locations over two years (2010–2011). A sub-set of 30 entries was additionally analyzed for grain Fe and Zn concentrations across four location–year combinations. Wide ranges of environmental means were observed for grain yield (73.3–210.8gm−2), Fe (37.4–45.4mgkg−1) and Zn (35.5–38.8mgkg−1). Genotypic, environmental and G×E interaction effects were highly significant (P<0.01) for grain yield and both nutrients. The first two principal components of the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) explained 32.1%, 27.4% and 42.6% of total variances for grain yield, Fe and Zn concentrations, respectively. The irrigated Wad Medani sites (no drought) were consistently grouped into one mega-environment, revealing an opportunity for selecting for specific adaptation to this type of environment. Genotype-by-year (G×Y) and genotype-by-location-by-year (G×L×Y) interaction effects contributed largely to the total G×E interaction for grain yield in the rainfed environments (mild/moderate post-flowering and severe post-planting and post-flowering drought), underlining the need of selecting for yield stability. Depending on farmers’ risk aversion, assessment of yield stability should be done according to the static or dynamic yield stability concept – both types of stability measures were not correlated in the present study. Several outstanding genotypes in terms performance and stability (static or dynamic) of yield, Fe and Zn concentrations were identified. These are promising experimental varieties or germplasm sources for programs targeting pearl millet productivity enhancement in Sudan.

N2  - Agricultural water trade has been adopted in many countries as a measure to overcome water deficiency facing irrigated regions. When correctly applied, the system can allocate more water to more productive farmers, thereby improving efficiency in resource utilisation. Despite this enormous advantage, the water trading scheme set up in Zhangye City, of China's arid northwestern region, is being virtually ignored by local farmers, with the penetration rate standing at less than one percent of the total water use. To investigate the reasons behind the system's malfunction, farmers, farmers’ associations, and relevant governmental agencies were extensively interviewed. Then, based on the information collected from the field, a nonlinear programming model replicating the local water market was constructed. The modelling analysis showed that the solutions for the farmer's optimisation problem, hereby simulated under geographically scattered plots that are typical in the study area, are significantly different from those derived under the assumption of single plot operations. The optimal level of price intervention also differs for the two operations, as the fragmentation of farmland induces additional water demand. This result reiterates the importance of market designs that are tailored to local situations, and the danger of unconditional acceptance of economic institutions that are prevalent and successful elsewhere.

N2  - Global ethanol production has grown rapidly due to national renewable fuel programs. Concern has grown over impacts that land conversion and crop displacement driven by ethanol feedstock production might have on water resources. In this paper, we examine irrigation decisions of agricultural producers in the Kansas portion of the High Plains Aquifer in response to local ethanol market expansion. To identify the effects of ethanol expansion on irrigation decisions, we examine field-level data on irrigation water use, irrigated acreage, and crop decisions for the years 2003–2017 for nearly 23,000 fields in Kansas. We measure the response of three irrigation decisions, (i) irrigated acreage, (ii) irrigation per acre, and (iii) total water use to the introduction and capacity expansion of an ethanol plant. We find that ethanol market expansion did lead to increases in irrigation water use. Specifically, a 10 % increase in ethanol capacity within 50KM increases annual water use by 0.22 % per field (4.8 acre-inches/field). We predict that ethanol markets accounted for about 4% of total irrigated water use in 2017. © 2021 The Author(s)

N2  - Accurate estimation of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is needed in water resources planning and management, irrigation scheduling and efficient agricultural water management. The FAO56-PM combination model is usually applied as a benchmark model for calculating ETo and calibrating other ETo models. However, the need for large amount of meteorological variables is a major drawback of this model, especially in case of data scarcity. Therefore, application of ETo models relying on fewer meteorological parameters, as well as calculating ETo using estimated meteorological variables is recommended in literature. The present paper aims at assessing the performances of different ETo models using the recorded and estimated meteorological parameters and comparing the results with the corresponding gene expression programming (GEP) models (based on the same input parameters of the employed ETo models) in hyper-arid regions. Daily meteorological parameters from 5 hyper-arid locations of Iran (covering a period of 12 years) were used. The commonly used Hargreaves (HG), Priestley-Taylor (PT), Turc (Tr) and Kimberly-Penman (KP, for alfalfa reference crop) were established and calibrated using both the recorded and estimated solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed data. The obtained results revealed that the GEP models outperform the corresponding empirical and semi-empirical models in all three studied categorizes (temperature/humidity-, radiation-, and combination-based approaches). The results also showed that the calibrated PT (original) and Tr (with estimated relative humidity) models gave the most accurate results among the related groups.

N2  - The US Pacific Northwest (PNW) is characterized by high latitude and Mediterranean climate where wheat production is predominantly rain-fed and often subject to low soil moisture. As a result, selection for drought-adaptive traits in modern cultivars has been an integral component of the regional breeding programs. The goal of this research was to evaluate phenotypic associations of morpho-physiological traits and their response to soil moisture variation in winter wheat germplasm adapted to the PNW. A panel of 402 winter wheat accessions (87 hard and 315 soft) was evaluated for spectral reflectance indices (SRIs), canopy temperature (CT), plant stature, phenology, grain yield, and yield components under rain-fed and irrigated conditions in 2012–2014. Variation in soil moisture and temperature cumulatively explained 86% of total yield variation across years and locations. The phenotypic associations of yield with phenology, plant height, and CT were environment dependent. Various SRIs related to biomass, stay green, pigment composition, and hydration status showed consistent patterns of response to drought and strong correlations with yield (p<0.001). The compensatory interaction of grain number and weight was indicated in the negative correlation between thousand kernel weight and grain number per spike across moisture regimes. Area under vegetation index curve (AUVIC) explained 53–88% of the total variation in stay green estimated from visual score of flag leaf senescence (p<0.001). Principal component analysis revealed three major clusters that explained more than 76% of interrelations among traits. The market classes within the study population showed differentiation with respect to these traits. This study highlights the potential use of spectral radiometry in field screening of winter wheat for grain yield and drought adaptation in Mediterranean-like environments.

N2  - This study examines the suitability of trunk dendrometers for assessing fruit growth under deficit irrigation (DI) for two consecutive years in a mature citrus orchard. Two DI programmes were applied during the maximum evapotranspirative demand period: sustained-deficit irrigation, applied at 50% ETC on average, and low-frequency deficit irrigation, applied according to plant–water status, establishing different irrigation–restriction cycles. Additionally, a control treatment at 100% ETC was monitored for the entire irrigation season. Trunk daily growth (TDG) and fruit daily growth (FDG) were estimated together with stem-water potential at midday (Ψstem) and the maximum daily shrinkage of the trunk (MDS). Significant relationships were determined for Ψstem vs. TDG (R2=0.60), and vs. FDG (R2=0.78). In addition, significant relationships were established between TDG vs. FDG (R2=0.60), and between the daily increment of MDS (ΔMDS) and FDG (R2=0.50), revealing the strong connection between trunk and fruit variations caused by water stress. According to these findings, the DI effects on fruit growth can be monitored by means of TDF or temporal evolution of Ψstem, promising automation possibilities for appropriately regulating irrigation under DI programmes, and predicting its effects on fruit size by continuous field measurement.

N2  - In this study, we explore the possibility of “collective auction” of conservation contracts, and related issues, through a social experiment. We then propose an alternative policy to achieve both collective action in irrigation management and cost-effective water environment conservation. In a “collective auction”, individual farmers as well as farmers’ groups are allowed to participate. Communication and coordination among farmers and farmers’ groups are allowed. Based on our participant survey and comparison with environmental payments for similar, previous conservation activities, the auction result shows that contract prices could be, at the very least, cost-effective. Moreover, collective irrigation management is not negatively affected owing to the auction. We find evidence of group participation and price coordination, which result in saving auction transaction costs, among local communities active in collective action in local resource management. Conversely, we find that bidding occurred at the individual farmer level as well. This difference in approach depends on the extent of the auction coordinators’ commitment to the auction, reflected by their risk evaluation of unsuccessful bids. In either case, the auction coordinators could manage to minimize the likely unfairness arising from the auction. Although establishing a competitive environment to prevent possible collusion in such auctions is challenging, this study provides empirical evidence that collective action in pre-existing local resource management can reduce auction transaction costs. Utilizing local communities’ abilities to organize collective action can reduce these costs and minimize the possible unfairness arising from the auction, thus facilitating compatibility between cost-effective conservation owing to the auction and local resource conservation by collective action. Finally, we suggest that (1) the transaction cost of such an auction could be reduced by allotting adequate time for collective decision making, and (2) conservation programs should be designed to minimize their impact on production bases.

N2  - A mathematical model is developed for the optimal multi-crop irrigation areas associated with reservoir operation policies in a reservoir-irrigation system. Optimal area allocations are considered by addressing an appropriate mathematical model. The reservoir operations are related to releases policy, monthly water allocations, and occasional reservoir spills in a monthly operating time. The objective is to maximize the annual benefit of the system by supplying irrigation water for a proposed multi-crop pattern over the planning period. Herein, three sets of constraints are applied to the system: achieving monthly balance in the reservoir, covering water demand for crop production, considering evaporation loss from the reservoir, and governing equations for reservoir release and operations. The provided model is formulated with these constraints linked together by appropriate additional constraints as a linear programming model. Sensitivity analysis of inflow and alternative irrigation policies is conducted to investigate their effect on the final results. The methodology is applied to a real case study of a reservoir-irrigation system in Iran to show the applicability of the model.

N2  - Drought is a major cause of crop failure and livelihood insecurity, affecting millions of people across the world. A changing climate, increasing population and economic growth are exacerbating water shortages, further interrupting agricultural production. Assessing and minimizing the impacts of drought require a thorough understanding of the interrelationships and interactions between the climate system, ecosystems and human systems. In this paper, we apply causal loop modelling grounded in systems thinking theory to examine the interdependencies and feedback processes among factors associated with drought that impact crop production using a case study of Robusta coffee production systems in Viet Nam – the world’s second-largest coffee producing country. Our model, underpinned by qualitative data from consultation with a range of stakeholders, indicates that water depletion affecting coffee cultivation is not solely attributed to rainfall insufficiency but an outcome of complex interactions between climate and socio-economic systems. Our analysis highlights that uncontrollable coffee expansion, largely at the expense of forested areas, is partly the unintended consequence of policy decisions, including those encouraging migration and perennial crop development. Growing water demand in the region, including the demand for irrigation water driven by the ever-increasing area under coffee cultivation, as well as inefficient irrigation practices are placing significant pressure on water resources. A changing climate may exacerbate the problem, further impacting coffee cultivation, unless adaptation practices occur. A number of potential interventions are suggested, including explicit zoning of coffee-growing areas; awareness raising for wide adoption of optimal irrigation practices; converting Robusta coffee monocultures to diversified systems; and strictly protecting existing forests coupled with afforestation and reforestation. These interventions should be simultaneously implemented in order to adequately address drought and water scarcity for coffee production and build resilience to climate and market risks.

N2  - The paper describes one of the four datasets used to test pesticide leaching models within the Working Group Modelling of the EC European Program COST Action 66 ‘Fate of Pesticides in the Soil and the Environment’. The Tor Mancina dataset is the result of a 3-year lysimeter experiment carried out near Rome (Italy) on a clay-loam calcareous fluvisol, which aimed to asses the risk of groundwater contamination from some herbicides commonly used in the Mediterranean area. Parameters available for modelling are water percolation, bromide leaching, and the occurrence of metolachlor residues in leachates. All parameters refer to two irrigation treatments to evaluate the effect of different water supplies (398 and 548mm). The total amount of percolated water was equal to 660mm as an average for both the treatments, with a total rainfall of 2432mm. The average concentration of metolachlor in the leachate was 0.008÷0.012μgl−1, and maximum concentration 1.63÷22.9μgl−1.

N1  - Modelling &amp; Sustainability
N2  - Linear programming (LP), a well-established technique for modelling agricultural and other systems, has been extensively used to model irrigation systems in Australia. The models constructed have been used to assess the effects of changing water charges on farm incomes, water use, and the effects of trade in water allocations. An LP model that reflects actual farm behaviour requires a large amount of data. Moreover, demand and supply functions estimated with LP models are necessarily stepped rather than smooth. Howitt has suggested a way of escaping from these problems of LP models. His positive programming approach replaces an LP model with a simpler quadratic programming model. In this paper, Howitt's approach is used to develop a quadratic programming model from an existing LP model of irrigated agriculture in the southern Murray-Darling basin of Australia. A comparison of the quadratic and linear models indicates that the quadratic programming model is smaller and simpler to specify and that it produces similar results to the linear model, in terms of cropping, trade, and demand for irrigation water. The choice of modelling technique depends on the problem and the available resources. Positive programming can be a valuable addition to the farm modellers' arsenal.

N2  - In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) canopy architecture influences light penetration into the canopy and radiation use efficiency particularly during the period between stem elongation and anthesis which is the critical time for the determination of yield. Despite large differences in canopy architecture among spring wheat genotypes, ranging from erectophile to planophile upper leaves, there is little prior evidence to suggest that selection for canopy architecture influences yield. In this study we evaluated the variation for canopy architecture in a 4-way MAGIC population (n=∼ 1000 lines) developed from 4 Australian commercial spring wheats and an 8-way MAGIC population (n=∼ 300 lines) developed from 3 Australian and 5 northern hemisphere commercial wheats. The 4-way population was grown at both an irrigated and a dryland site in southern New South Wales whereas the 8-way population was grown at the irrigated site. We also measured grain yield, plant height and crop development stage at the irrigated site. Using a smaller subset of lines which we grouped into either erectophile or planophile we studied how canopy architecture influences grain yield and associated yield traits (above-ground biomass (AGBM), harvest index, yield components, flowering time and height). The grain yield in the latter experiments varied from 5 to 6 t ha−1. Averaged over two years and two sowing dates in each year lines that were erectophile yielded 13% more than the planophile lines and most of this yield advantage was associated with a higher AGBM (11%). Erectophile lines had 24% more grains per unit area but a 9% lower grain weight. Erectophile lines flowered 2 days later than planophile lines and they were 7 cm shorter. Lodging, although rare in these studies, was more evident in the planophile lines. In both MAGIC populations the most erectophile lines yielded 24% more grain than the most planophile lines. Mapping was conducted on the 1000 lines from the 4-way MAGIC population grown at the irrigated and the dryland site. It showed that genetic control of canopy architecture was complex but QTL were generally repeatable at both sites. Significant QTL were identified on most chromosomes. G x E was low for canopy architecture as the scores were repeatable across years (r2 = 0.85). This trait opens the way to improve wheat yields via increasing crop biomass which in the past has been largely intractable in breeding programs.

N2  - Knowledge of forest water use is crucial to water resources managers, especially in arid environments. Flood irrigation has sometimes been used to ameliorate forest decline, however, there has only been limited research on vegetation responses to these interventions. We undertook a study to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) and its components, transpiration (T) and evaporation (E), of two Populus euphratica Oliv. stands (MA: middle-aged and OA: old-aged) with and without flood irrigation in the lower Heihe River Basin of NW China. ET and T were measured using eddy covariance and sap flow methods, respectively. Understory E was estimated by difference. Annual ET was 766.4 mm in the MA stand and 532.5 mm in the OA stand with an average of 4.2 and 2.9 mm d−1 during the growing season, respectively. ET of the MA stand was 44% higher than that of the OA stand, with contributions of 28% and 16% from E and T. Despite stand density, leaf area index and canopy cover being higher in the MA than OA stand sapwood area within the two stands was similar (MA 6.04 m2 ha−1 and OA 6.02 m2 ha−1). We hypothesised lower understory E and a lower E to ET ratio in the MA stand than OA stand. However, E was approximately 63% of ET in both stands. Therefore, we conclude that differences in ET, T and E were mainly associated with the flood irrigation. This was further supported by the comparable ET between the OA stand and the other studies in arid regions of Central Asia. In conclusion, flood irrigation has a less significant effect on canopy water use (T) than understory E suggesting alternatives to flood irrigation might be more appropriate in this water-limited ecosystem.

N2  - Continuous monocropping of tobacco, excessive tillage and inadequate
irrigation management have caused soil degradation in tobacco farms in
the Valle de Lerma. Soil degradation due to tobacco monocropping and
uncertain economic perspectives for tobacco farming call for
diversification strategies for tobacco farmers. The objective of this
paper is to develop useful criteria for assessing diversification
activities and to provide a ranking of different diversification
activities on these criteria. The Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)
technique is applied to get consistent assessments of criteria and
activities from experts and stakeholders. Next, goal programming methods
are used to aggregate individual assessments in order to arrive at the
final ranking of farming activities for diversification. The five
criteria to judge production activities for tobacco diversification are
contribution to income, suitability for biophysical conditions,
availability of technical information, market feasibility and
contribution to soil improvement. The feasibility to market the products
stands out with clearly high relative weight, while the other criteria
received similar weights. The obtained weights of farming activities
showed that especially livestock activities and spring-summer crops are
important alternatives for tobacco production. Livestock activities
stand out because they have high scores on all criteria. Livestock
activities and spring-summer crops will compete with tobacco for
resources because tobacco is a spring-summer crop. Therefore, these
activities may be more suitable for tobacco farms that operate large
area of land. The results of this research can be used in optimization
models for determining the optimal mix of farming activities in
combination with tobacco production. Such models can provide further
insights into factors determining diversification. (c) 2012 Elsevier

N2  - The coefficient of uniformity (CU), an important parameter in design of irrigation systems, affects the quality and return of investment in irrigation projects significantly, and is a good indicator of water losses. In this paper, a single model was proposed to obtain the CU values in four sprinkler types of ZK30, ZM22, AMBO, and LUXOR. Average wind speed, coarseness index (large and small nozzle diameters), and sprinkler/lateral spacing were used as input parameters to obtain the CU values through employing the artificial neural networks (ANN), neuro-fuzzy grid partitioning (NF-GP), neuro-fuzzy sub-clustering (NF-SC), least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and gene expression programming (GEP) techniques. The available data set consisted of 294 samples that were used to evaluate the proposed methodology. The applied techniques were assessed through the robust k-fold testing data assignment mode. Based on the results, all the applied models presented good capability in estimating CU. The obtained results revealed that the coarseness index (large nozzle diameter) had the lowest impact on modeling CU is sprinkler irrigation systems.

N2  - In this study, the installation objectives and impacts of Turkey's two major multidam transboundary hydropower projects, Southeastern Anatolia (Euprathes and Tigris Rivers) and Northeastern Anatolia (Coruh River) Projects, are discussed. Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) having 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants is the large-scale water management program aiming to increase the domestic electricity production and develop vast irrigation schemes for agriculture. Coruh River is the longest river in the east Black Sea region, having high economic importance to Turkey because of its largely undeveloped but economically exploitable hydropower potential. Coruh multiple dams project consists of 27 planned dams and hydroelectric power plants. Besides numerous expected benefits from these projects, also a multitude of substantial social, economic, and environmental impact potentials exist. In spite of numerous social and economic benefits experienced in the area in social and economic spheres due to the project, there is also a multitude of adverse impacts observed in the environment. In social and economic spheres, the land acquisition and resettlement of people are important issues. Large-scale irrigation causes salinization and leads to soil erosion; huge water reservoirs affect local climate and are a source of considerable amounts of pollution, including greenhouse gases. Changes in land use pattern carry potential to deprive plants and animals of their natural habitat. Moreover, urbanization and industrialization, following social and economical development, bring about increased pollution levels, degrading air and water quality.

N2  - Groundwater irrigation can dramatically affect agricultural production and productivity. Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries. We find no discernible impact on household expenditure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The water resource of the Blue Nile River basin (BNRB) has been under pressure due to growing demands from many users, and the climate change impact. Potential impact of climate change for the maximum, median and minimum projected changes in the simulated streamflow of BNRB by a hydrologic model, VIC, driven by Representative Concentration Pathways climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, of 4 GCMs (global climate models) downscaled dynamically by a regional climate model, WRF (Weather Research Forecasting) using a one-domain framework that covers the entire NRB for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100. These projected changes in streamflow were used to assess its future water allocations using a stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm and a hydro-economic model to optimize hydropower production and irrigated agriculture. Overall, it seems the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) reservoir will likely not operate at full storage level because the streamflow of BNRB is assumed to be regulated by three upstream reservoirs. The outflow from the reservoir of GERD or BNRB's annual flow at Khartoum is projected to increase under maximum, but is expected to decrease under minimum and median projected changes in streamflow for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100, respectively. Given the annual net benefit obtained from hydropower production and irrigated agriculture of the reservoir is projected to increase (decrease) under the maximum (median and minimum) projected changes in streamflow, the potential climate change impact should be considered in designing and developing the future water resources of BNRB.

N2  - Summary
The management of water through the impoundment of rivers by dams and reservoirs is necessary to support key human activities such as hydropower production, agriculture and flood risk mitigation. Advances in multi-objective optimization techniques and ever growing computing power make it possible to design reservoir operating policies that represent Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between multiple interests. On the one hand, such optimization methods can enhance performances of commonly targeted objectives (such as hydropower production or water supply), on the other hand they risk strongly penalizing all the interests not directly (i.e. mathematically) included in the optimization algorithm. The alteration of the downstream hydrological regime is a well established cause of ecological degradation and its evaluation and rehabilitation is commonly required by recent legislation (as the Water Framework Directive in Europe). However, it is rarely embedded in reservoir optimization routines and, even when explicitly considered, the criteria adopted for its evaluation are doubted and not commonly trusted, undermining the possibility of real implementation of environmentally friendly policies. The main challenges in defining and assessing hydrological alterations are: how to define a reference state (referencing); how to define criteria upon which to build mathematical indicators of alteration (measuring); and finally how to aggregate the indicators in a single evaluation index (valuing) that can serve as objective function in the optimization problem. This paper aims to address these issues by: (i) discussing the benefits and constrains of different approaches to referencing, measuring and valuing hydrological alteration; (ii) testing two alternative indices of hydrological alteration, one based on the established framework of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (Richter et al., 1996), and one satisfying the mathematical properties required by widely used optimization methods based on dynamic programming; (iii) demonstrating and discussing these indices by application River Ticino, in Italy; (iv) providing a framework to effectively include hydrological alteration within reservoir operation optimization.

N2  - In Afghanistan. where 80% of the population is rural, irrigated
agriculture using surface water is an extremely important economic
activity. With the advent of the New Water Law, highly localized and
centuries-old agricultural water management traditions are giving way to
more modern centralized institutions. The newly-created river basin
councils need management tools to support decision-making at the
watershed level. This study develops the Afghan Canal Irrigation
Management and Policy Tool (ACIMAP), a versatile linear
programming-based model that can be used to optimize crop selection and
water allocation within Afghan irrigation districts. The model can
further be used in the assessment of the benefits from various
irrigation infrastructure improvements. This study describes the
development of ACIMAP and applies it to an illustrative case study on
the Balkhab River in Balkh Province, Afghanistan. The benefits to the
district's farmers of constructing a reservoir of various capacities are
analyzed and compared with the benefits derived from increasing
conveyance efficiencies in the canal networks and the assignment of
water rights. It is found that while the construction of a reservoir
could increase agricultural net revenues by up to 30%, even greater
benefits may result from increasing distribution efficiencies. Further,
property rights schemes may be implemented to distribute wealth more
evenly through various canal sub-regions at minimal cost to the
agricultural community as a whole. These results demonstrate the
usefulness of ACIMAP in assessing alternative irrigation policies. (C)

N2  - Context: Growing socio-economic development and population poses
unprecedented challenges for agriculture in meeting increasing demand of
food, water, and energy. Rethinking the future agricultural production
to simultaneously safeguard resources security and regulate
environmental pollution is essential. Circular agriculture opens up a
new path for the high-efficiency and environmental-friendly production.
An integrated energy-water-food nexus optimization approach for managing
agricultural resources and wastes in line with the principles of
sustainable circular agriculture management is lacking. Objective: This
study therefore proposes an integrated uncertain optimization model to
manage agricultural croplivestock-biogas-crop recycling systems from a
cross-sectoral energy-water-food nexus perspective in the changing
environment. The aims are to: (1) balance objectives of input reduction,
output promotion, ensuring equity, and global warming mitigation; (2)
generate sustainable resources allocation strategies based on efficiency
and recycling; (3) assess the global warming mitigation potential of the
recycling systems from a life cycle perspective; and (4) deal with
interactions, complexities, uncertainties, and risks existed in the
recycling systems. Methods: The proposed model framework is based on a
stochastic multi-objective programming, while triangular fuzzy numbers,
fuzzy credibility constrained programming, Stewart model, analytic
hierarchy process, andopportunity carbon footprint are integrated to
enhance its practicability and feasibility. The model is verified
through a real-world case study in the Zhanghe Irrigation District,
Hubei province, China. Results and conclusions: Results show that
optimal water and land resources allocation solutions are more efficient
than current strategies, with water consumption per unit area decreasing
by 13.63% and rice production per unit area improving by 22.06%. Paddy
field and biogas leakage are two of the largest sources of GHG emission,
calling for agronomic and engineering measures to improve farmland
management and biogas generation technology. Livestock breeding
contributes 10% of the total GHG emission, along with generating 76%
of the total biogas, indicating the great significance of manure
recycle. Overall, 4.26 x 108 kg CO2 is reduced in the recycling system,
contributed by chemical fertilizer reduction, agricultural wastes
recycle, and non-renewable energy replacement. Significance: The study
offers a potential nexus optimization approach for sustainable
management of agricultural recycling systems from a holistic
perspective. It can be used as a general model to extend to other
agricultural systems suffering from similar resources and environmental
crisis.

N2  - Irrigation, soil moisture and temperature play an important role in potato production. This field study was conducted at a private potato farm in SW Florida from 2012 to 2014. The randomized complete block design was used: four production farms each with a pair of seepage and hybrid center pivot irrigation systems. Soil moisture and temperature at five soil depths, rainfall, and water table in situ were monitored. Nitrate levels at the top 20cm soils were measured at harvest in the second growing season. Water usage was calculated by the flow meters and rain gauges. Potato yields were measured. The stepwise linear regression showed that the potato yield was mainly regulated by the surface (10cm) soil temperature and soil water moisture at 20 and 30cm depths. Hybrid center pivot can save more than 50% of irrigation water without significant yield loss, suggesting center pivot has great potential in water savings. Hybrid center pivot irrigation had relatively low nitrate concentrations at the top 20cm soil, indicating a new fertilizer program may be needed for overhead irrigation.

N2  - This paper employs the discrete choice experiment method to estimate the benefits of improved wastewater treatment programs to mitigate the impacts of water pollution in Nairobi, Kenya. Urban and peri-urban farmers who use wastewater for irrigation from Motoine to Ngong River in Nairobi were randomly selected for the study. A random parameter logit model was used to estimate the individual level willingness to pay for the wastewater treatment before reuse in irrigation. The results show that urban and peri-urban farmers are willing to pay significant monthly municipality taxes for treatment of wastewater. We find that the quality of treated wastewater, the quantity of treated wastewater and the riverine ecosystem restoration are significant factors of preference over alternative policy designs in reduction of water pollution.

N2  - Summary
Many states in India are currently facing general overuse of their groundwater resources mainly due to growing demand for irrigated agriculture. Groundwater levels are declining despite water harvesting measures to enhance aquifer recharge which are supported on a massive scale by watershed development programmes. New programmes are being implemented to improve artificial percolation (i.e., managed aquifer recharge, MAR) although the impact of former measures on aquifer recharge has not yet been assessed. It is therefore crucial to increase our understanding of MAR to successfully overcome the threat of groundwater scarcity in the near future. This paper scrutinizes the ability of a typical percolation tank to recharge the aquifer using a comprehensive approach combining water accounting, geochemistry and hydrodynamic modelling. Over 2years of observation, the percolation efficiency (percolated fraction of stored water) of the tank ranged from 57% to 63%, the rest being evaporated. Modelling showed that the percolated water was mostly (80%) pumped straight back by the neighbouring boreholes, limiting the area of MAR influence but increasing percolation efficiency.

N2  - Climate change poses great challenges for food security and water use. This study aimed to investigate the response of winter wheat in Northern China to climate change and propose corresponding strategies to maintain yield and crop water productivity (WPc). Climate model projections from the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used to drive the process-based soil–water–atmosphere–plant (SWAP) agro-hydrological model. The SWAP parameters were optimized by the Parameter Estimation program (PEST), which extended the crop model to the regional scale. SWAP was used to simulate responses of crop growth, evapotranspiration (ET), and yield to baseline (2006–2012) climate and two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for future climate conditions. The results indicated that PEST had high optimization efficiency and calibrated SWAP performed well (average relative error < 20.87 % and normalized root mean square error < 25.83 %). Compared with baseline, the maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly (P < 0.05) by 6.47°C and 8.59°C, respectively. The cumulative precipitation during the growing season increased by 303.22–316.12 mm. Warming significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the growth period of winter wheat by 25.3–34.7 days, especially in the emergence–heading stage. Path analysis revealed that significant (P < 0.05) change of precipitation was a determining factor in increasing ET. The adverse effect of temperature increase offset the promotion of yield due to radiation, and ultimately led to a yield reduction of 35.57–41.14 %. The optimization scenario indicated that late-maturing varieties and irrigation adjustment could improve yield (up to 38.21 %) and WPc (up to 44.30 %) under future climate conditions. Implementing irrigation at an early growing stage (joining and heading) was beneficial to increase yield and WPc. We recommend combining late-maturing varieties with irrigation adjustments to maintain yield and WPc under future climate conditions.

N2  - The different hydraulic measures of emitter flow variation (qvar) and manufacturer’s coefficient of variation (CVm) at different operating pressure (P) and water temperature (T) were determined by measuring the discharge of different labyrinth-channel emitters. Gene expression programming (GEP) was used to model and predict qvar and CVm of the labyrinth emitters. The structural parameters of each labyrinth emitter [namely, trapezoidal unit number (N), height (H), and spacing (S), and path width (W) and length (L)] as well asP and T were considered as independent variables. The accuracy of GEP models was evaluated by their coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), overall index of model performance (OI), and mean absolute error (MAE). Results of GEP applications established that L and S were the least important variables affecting qvar and CVm, respectively, while N and H were the most important variables. For qvar, the GEPwithout L model gave higher R2 and OI and lower RMSE and MAE than those of the GEPwithout S model. Conversely, for CVm, R2 and OI of the GEPwithout L model were lower and its RMSE and MAE were higher than the corresponding parameters of the GEPwithout S model. Overall, our results indicated that the performance of the developed GEP models were better at predicting qvar and CVm for non-pressure-compensating emitters than pressure-compensating ones. The GEP approach can be a good tool to predict the hydraulic performance of labyrinth emitters.

N1  - Recent Advances in Water Resources Management
N2  - Policies and institutional frameworks associated with and / or impacting on agricultural water management (AWM) in smallholder farming systems in Zimbabwe were analyzed through literature reviews, feedback from stakeholder workshops, key informant interviews and evaluation of policy impacts on implemented case study projects/programmes. The study showed that Zimbabwe has gone a long way towards developing a water management policy addressing both equity and access, through the Water and ZINWA1ZINWA stands for Zimbabwe National Water Authority.1 of 1998. However, lack of incentives for improving efficient management and utilization of water resources once water has reached the farm gate was apparent, apart from punitive economic instruments levied on usage of increased volumes of water. For example, the new water reforms of 1998 penalized water savers through loss of any unused water in their permits to other users. In addition, the ability of smallholder farmers to access water for irrigation or other purposes was influenced by macro and micro-economic policies such as Economic Structural and Adjustment Programme (ESAP), Zimbabwe Programme for Economic and Social Transformation (ZIMPREST), prevailing monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the Land and Agrarian Reform policies. For instance, the implementation of ESAP from 1991 to 95 resulted in a decline in government support to management of communal irrigation schemes, and as a result only gravity-fed schemes survived. Also AWM projects/programmes that were in progress were prematurely terminated. While considerable emphasis was placed on rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure since the fast track land reform in 1998, the policies remained rather silent on strategies for water management in rainfed systems. The piecemeal nature and fragmentation of policies and institutional frameworks scattered across government ministries and sectors were complex and created difficulties for smallholder farmers to access water resources. Poor policy implementation strategies and lack of funding were some of the major weaknesses in Zimbabwe’s AWM policies. It was apparent that the prevailing institutional frameworks that underwent restructuring exercises since 2000, failed to effectively deliver services to smallholder farmers due to lack of human and financial capital. Nevertheless, the study showed that policies that can improve efficient utilization of agricultural water in rainfed systems need to target timely provision of the prime movers, i.e. credit, input markets and viable output markets, among other factors, so as to fully utilize good rainfall seasons. It was recommended that a forum led by ZINWA be set up to harmonize AWM issues across sectors and monitor their implementation. Such a forum would be mandated mainly to run periodic water management workshops in which relevant and interested stakeholders participate.

N2  - Summary
Groundwaters and their dependent ecosystems are affected both by the meteorological conditions as well as from human interventions, mainly in the form of groundwater abstractions for irrigation needs. This work aims at investigating the quantitative effects of meteorological conditions and man intervention on groundwater resources and their dependent ecosystems. Various seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with external predictor variables were used in order to model the influence of meteorological conditions and man intervention on the groundwater level time series. Initially, a seasonal ARIMA model that simulates the abstraction time series using as external predictor variable temperature (T) was prepared. Thereafter, seasonal ARIMA models were developed in order to simulate groundwater level time series in 8 monitoring locations, using the appropriate predictor variables determined for each individual case. The spatial component was introduced through the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Application of the proposed methodology took place in the Neon Sidirochorion alluvial aquifer (Northern Greece), for which a 7-year long time series (i.e., 2003–2010) of piezometric and groundwater abstraction data exists. According to the developed ARIMA models, three distinct groups of groundwater level time series exist; the first one proves to be dependent only on the meteorological parameters, the second group demonstrates a mixed dependence both on meteorological conditions and on human intervention, whereas the third group shows a clear influence from man intervention. Moreover, there is evidence that groundwater abstraction has affected an important protected ecosystem.

N2  - The impact of small-scale irrigation investments on household consumption, assets, and informal insurance is estimated from a panel of Northern Malian households (1998-2006). Access to irrigation increases household consumption by 27-30% relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household's savings behavior and informal insurance network.

N2  - A physically based model of the energy balance of a vegetated rooftop has been developed and integrated into the EnergyPlus building energy simulation program. This green roof module allows the energy modeler to explore green roof design options including growing media thermal properties and depth, and vegetation characteristics such as plant type, height and leaf area index. The model has been tested successfully using observations from a monitored green roof in Florida. A preliminary set of parametric tests has been conducted on prototypical 4000m2 office buildings in Chicago IL and Houston TX. These tests focus on evaluating the role of growing media depth, irrigation, and vegetation density (leaf area index) on both natural gas and electricity consumption. Building energy consumption was found to vary significantly in response to variations in these parameters. Further, this response depended significantly on building location (climate). Hence, it is evident that the green roof simulation tool presented here can serve a valuable role in informing green roof design decisions.

N2  - This study investigates farmers’ preferences and willingness to pay for cropland attributes in Bahir Dar, northwest Ethiopia. A choice experiment is used to elicit farmers’ preferences between different land use attributes, including a monetary attribute. The study was conducted in the croplands that are threatened by land expropriation for urban expansion. A survey was undertaken with 144 farmers in four rural kebeles surrounding the city (Addis Alem, Weramit, Wereb and Zenzelima). In the survey, respondents were provided with hypothetical land purchasing decisions, with three alternatives (i.e., two hypothetical parcels and an opt-out option). A choice experiment was undertaken to measure farmers’ interest in different types of croplands, which varies with respect to irrigability, number of trees per ha, soil erosion resistance and water holding capacity of the cropland. Estimation of two mixed logit models was carried out. The estimation results show that, although the farmers did not show strong preferences for each attribute of the cropland, many farmers in the area showed interest in the proposed alternative croplands. Farmers show more interest for the land that is irrigable, gentle slope and with medium water holding capacity. The results also indicate that farmers assign highest marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) (79.01 ETB per square meter) for irrigated land, followed by medium water holding capacity with MWTP of 52.13 ETB per square meter. We believe that the results of this study would help land use policy and decision makers in the study area to consider the various attributes of cropland in land use planning, including land expropriation programs, which assures the sustainability of ecosystem services.

N2  - Seasonal agricultural droughts (SAD) often cause yield loss for the farming community around the world, reinforcing the need to optimize both water-saving measures and irrigation schedules to improve irrigation water use efficiency. This study proposed a Copula-based stochastic multiobjective programming (C-SMP) model for optimizing irrigation strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of SAD. The model uses the regional net irrigation water demand and stream runoff to formulate the Copula, which better characterizes SAD. Drought scenarios are selected based on reservoir storage capacity and irrigation water use efficiency. Then, randomness of drought scenarios from Copula model, multiple conflicting objectives, selecting of water-saving measures, and deficit irrigation strategy optimization were addressed via the stochastic multiobjective programming technique. A case study was conducted in the Dongfeng reservoir irrigation district (DFRID), Meishan City of Sichuan Province, southwest China to optimize both water-saving measures and deficit irrigation schedules for different crops during their growth periods. The results showed that: (1) the joint distribution model established by the Frank Copula function had the best performance in measuring SAD, and the probability of drought occurrence was 25% in DFRID; (2) optimal irrigation strategies improved the yield of wheat and citrus by around 12.51–32.22% and 8.33–12.83%, respectively, compared with the average level of Meishan City. Only the yield of rape was reduced by − 27.68∼− 1.42% under the extreme dry condition of net irrigation water demand, while it increased by 1.84–4.56% when the net irrigation water demand (NIWD) was in a dry condition; (3) the C-SMP demonstrated clear advantages in dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and the randomness of SAD scenarios. The proposed approach is applicable for irrigation districts suffering from SAD and can help formulate more effective and sustainable irrigation strategies.

N2  - Summary
In India, particularly in semi-arid regions, groundwater levels are declining at alarming rates due to overexploitation and the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources is in deep crisis. There is little or no information on groundwater sustainability indicators, which can signal towards the challenges in water management. In this study we downscaled an entire watershed into three zones based on the different hydrodynamic behaviour recorded at the borewell scale. A process-based simple, multi-parameter linear auto-regressive model was developed to predict groundwater levels, which uses recharge, groundwater withdrawal and irrigation return flow as input variables. A comprehensive and predictive long-term groundwater balance is used as a state indicator to evaluate the sustainability and management challenges in the watershed. Two groundwater withdrawal scenarios were designed to assess the impact of groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater balance. We found that geological heterogeneities play a crucial role in controlling groundwater fluctuations. The storage change in two different groundwater withdrawal scenarios shows gradually declining groundwater storage in both scenarios. A long-term assessment of the groundwater balance helps to analyse the state of the groundwater system and to locate priority zones for watershed interventions.

N2  - Common bean production in Goiás, Brazil is concentrated in the same geographic area, but spread across three distinct growing seasons, namely, wet, dry and winter. In the wet and dry seasons, common beans are grown under rainfed conditions, whereas the winter sowing is fully irrigated. The conventional breeding program performs all varietal selection stages solely in the winter season, with rainfed environments being incorporated in the breeding scheme only through the multi environment trials (METs) where basically only yield is recorded. As yield is the result of many interacting processes, it is challenging to determine the events (abiotic or biotic) associated with yield reduction in the rainfed environments (wet and dry seasons). To improve our understanding of rainfed dry bean production so as to produce information that can assist breeders in their efforts to develop stress-tolerant, high-yielding germplasm, we characterized environments by integrating weather, soil, crop and management factors using crop simulation models. Crop simulations based on two commonly grown cultivars (Pérola and BRS Radiante) and statistical analyses of simulated yield suggest that both rainfed seasons, wet and dry, can be divided in two groups of environments: highly favorable environment and favorable environment. For the wet and dry seasons, the highly favorable environment represents 44% and 58% of production area, respectively. Across all rainfed environment groups, terminal and/or reproductive drought stress occurs in roughly one fourth of the seasons (23.9% for Pérola and 24.7% for Radiante), with drought being most limiting in the favorable environment group in the dry TPE. Based on our results, we argue that even though drought-tailoring might not be warranted, the common bean breeding program should adapt their selection practices to the range of stresses occurring in the rainfed TPEs to select genotypes more suitable for these environments.

N2  - Sustainable management strategies for water resources rely on accurate knowledge about the dynamics of hydrological processes, especially in drylands, where freshwater is the limiting factor for the development of human society and ecosystems. The populated Loess Plateau (LP) in North China is a typical semi-arid region where competition for water between people and nature is worth noting because of afforestation promoted by the Grain to Green Program. In this study, changes in key components of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the LP were explored using a multi-satellite approach, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and Earth observations of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. By integrating data on human water use from different sources with satellite observations, we were able to examine the mechanisms driving these changes. The results demonstrated that, according to an evaluation based on reproducing TWS computed from the regional water balance in the LP, the mascon solution of the Center for Space Research (CSR) at University of Texas at Austin performed best out of the commonly used GRACE products. Regional TWS derived from the CSR mascon solution in the LP decreased significantly for the period 2003–2015. Significant decreases were also detected for regional ground water storage (GWS) estimated by decomposing the GRACE TWS using multi-sources remote sensing data. GWS made the greatest contribution to the changes in TWS. Increased plant transpiration was one reason for the decreasing trend of GWS. Because changes in precipitation, soil moisture and water consumed by irrigation were minor at regional scales, we concluded that the increase of transpiration is driven by deep-rooted trees planted, which use the part of precipitation that previously recharged groundwater. The findings from this study are valuable for water resource management and ecological restoration in semi-arid regions with high populations.

N2  - A model suitable for optimal allocation of sediment resources is utilized to cope with multiple uncertainties in the system and contradictions between allocation units. This approach incorporates inexact two-stage stochastic programming, probabilistic-possibilistic programming and fuzzy random intervals (ITPP-FRI) in an integrated framework. The multiple uncertainties of various parameters in this study are represented by the interval numbers with fuzziness and randomness. The model introduced the concept of possibility and necessity measures to address multiple uncertainties in the system, which are suitable for optimistic and pessimistic decision-makers, respectively. The model makes a tradeoff between multiple objectives including sediment siltation of each allocation unit, and economic benefits of the system. As demonstrated in the Weishan irrigation area, a number of alternative cases can be achieved at different probability levels and under varied sediment diversion scenarios. The result shows that the sediment allocation for the unit of desilting basins was significantly reduced by at least 4.3% compared with the current situation, and the units of transporting sediments to the fields and using them for producing building materials were increased by more than 15% and 5%, respectively. The sediment is allocated to the units in need and the channel siltation is reduced. According to the allocation results, a new pattern of regulating water delivery is put forward for irrigation area in this paper to meet the requirement of using limited water to transport sediment to each unit.

N2  - Sources of Pestalotiopsis sydowiana were determined on commercial nurseries producing Calluna vulgaris throughout the UK. The pathogen was isolated from diseased stock plants, nursery soils, used growing media, propagation trays and floor covering and dust collected from greenhouse walkways. P. sydowiana was not isolated from new or unused materials. Infection of cuttings of C. vulgaris was initiated from a range of contaminated or infected sources. The pathogen was able to survive on infected plant debris for up to 1 year to initiate new infections. Greenhouse trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of disease management methods (irrigation, tray disinfection and fungicide application) on control during the propagation of C. vulgaris. Disease incidence and foliar browning caused by P. sydowiana were less on cuttings watered by sub-irrigation compared with watering from overhead. Single and combined treatments of tray disinfection (hydrogen peroxide/peracetic acid) and a three-spray programme of prochloraz to the foliage of cuttings significantly reduced disease incidence and foliar browning compared to dipping trays in water. The combined tray disinfection and fungicide programme significantly reduced disease incidence but not foliar browning, compared to tray disinfection or fungicide application alone. Fungicide application alone was better than disinfection. The importance of these findings for the integrated control of P. sydowiana on ericaceous plant nurseries is discussed.

N1  - Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture
N2  - The volume of wastewater generated by domestic, industrial and commercial sources has increased with population, urbanization, improved living conditions, and economic development. The productive use of wastewater has also increased, as millions of small-scale farmers in urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries depend on wastewater or wastewater polluted water sources to irrigate high-value edible crops for urban markets, often as they have no alternative sources of irrigation water. Undesirable constituents in wastewater can harm human health and the environment. Hence, wastewater irrigation is an issue of concern to public agencies responsible for maintaining public health and environmental quality. For diverse reasons, many developing countries are still unable to implement comprehensive wastewater treatment programs. Therefore in the near term, risk management and interim solutions are needed to prevent adverse impacts from wastewater irrigation. A combination of source control, and farm-level and post-harvest measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers. The WHO guidelines revised in 2006 for wastewater use suggest measures beyond the traditional recommendations of producing only industrial or non-edible crops, as in many situations it is impossible to enforce a change in the current cash crop pattern, or provide alternative vegetable supply to urban markets. There are several opportunities for improving wastewater management via improved policies, institutional dialogues and financial mechanisms, which would reduce the risks in agriculture. Effluent standards combined with incentives or enforcement can motivate improvements in water management by household and industrial sectors discharging wastewater from point sources. Segregation of chemical pollutants from urban wastewater facilitates treatment and reduces risk. Strengthening institutional capacity and establishing links between water delivery and sanitation sectors through inter-institutional coordination leads to more efficient management of wastewater and risk reduction.

N2  - Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) can enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of crop-livestock systems in the western Mediterranean basin, but requires improved adaptation to stressful environments because of a predicted shortage of irrigation water and climate change. This study reports on three-year dry matter yields of five landraces from Morocco, Italy and Tunisia and seven varieties from France, Italy, Australia and USA assessed across 10 agricultural environments of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Italy of which four were rainfed, one was continuously irrigated (oasis management), and five were irrigated but adopted a nine-week suspension of irrigation during summer. Our objectives were targeting cultivars to specific environments, and assisting regional breeding programmes in defining adaptation strategies, genetic resources and opportunities for international co-operation. The crop persisted well in all environments, but environment mean yield was strictly associated (P<0.01) with annual and spring-summer (April–September) water available. Rainfed cropping implied 42% lower yield with 61% less spring-summer water available relative to irrigation with withheld summer water across three sites hosting both managements. All of these sites showed genotype×management interaction (at least P<0.10). Cross-over genotype×environment (GE) interaction between top-yielding cultivars occurred across the 10 environments. Total number of harvests (range: 9–23), soil salinity as measured by electrical conductivity (range: 0.20–6.0dSm−1), and average spring-summer water available (range: 102–932mm) were selected as significant (P<0.05) environmental covariates in a factorial regression model explaining 53% of GE interaction variation. This model was exploited for targeting cultivars as a function of site-specific levels of these factors. Its indications agreed largely with those of an additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model with two GE interaction principal components. An Italian landrace exhibited specific adaptation to severely drought-prone environments, whereas landraces from north Africa were not adapted to such environments. One Moroccan landrace was specifically adapted to high number of harvests (partly reflecting frequent mowing). One variety selected for salt tolerance, and one Moroccan landrace, were specifically adapted to salt-stress environments. Environment classification as a function of GE interaction effects indicated three groups which may be object of specific breeding: (i) rainfed or irrigated environments featuring limited spring-summer water available (<350mm), nil or low soil salinity, and moderate to low number of harvests; (ii) salt-stress environments; and (iii) environments characterized by high number of harvests.

N2  - Water is an issue in Spain, where it is generally scarce, and its availability is highly variable in different areas and times, particularly in agriculture, the main water consumer. Water pricing is one of the policy instruments used to control irrigation water use. However, specific contextual studies to provide greater details, understand farmers’ behaviour, and clarify the consequences and effectiveness of water pricing are generally unavailable. Here, we developed and applied a simulation model based on two Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) methods, which makes the model more robust, to better understand and quantify the impact of the north–south territorial gradient on farmers’ decisions concerning agricultural water pricing in the first phase of the Navarra Canal irrigation area in northern Spain. This model couples water use with rainfed and irrigated areas, farmer revenue, and labour. The results show spatial north–south variability in the 50 km of the first phase of the Navarra Canal. In northern and middle regions, when water prices are increased, rainfed crops are chosen to substitute irrigated crops due to abundant rainfall and a lack of the appropriate climate and soil to grow other crops. Meanwhile, southern regions depend mainly on irrigation and are more sensitive to water price increases. These very productive southern regions also show larger gross margins and paid labour values. In every canal region, with an increase of 0.1 EUR/m3 in the water price, economic losses can reach up to 400 EUR/ha. Meanwhile, an increase in water prices over 0 EUR/m3 leads to decreased water use per hectare.

N2  - Summary
Unplanned exploitation of groundwater from coastal aquifers may cause salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers. Coastal areas are generally overpopulated with fertile agricultural lands and diversified irrigated farming activities. The objective of this study was to develop a model to control/prevent seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer with a case study of the Silifke–Goksu Deltaic Plain. A computer program for the simulation of three-dimensional variable density groundwater flow, SEAWAT, is used to model the seawater intrusion mechanism of the Goksu Deltaic Plain along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The calibration analysis of the developed seawater intrusion model is performed using field measured data in the water-year of 2008 including static groundwater head, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solid (TDS), and chloride concentration values collected from 23 observation wells and the existing data which were compiled and reviewed. The main objectives for applying the seawater intrusion model to the Goksu Deltaic Plain were (1) to determine the hydraulic and hydrogeologic parameters of the aquifer, (2) to estimate the spatial variation of the salt concentration in the aquifer and (3) to investigate the impact of the increase and decrease in groundwater extractions. The simulation results show that the Goksu Deltaic Plain aquifer is especially sensitive to the increase in groundwater extraction.

N2  - Concerns about water scarcity and management have focused attention on the relationship between agriculture and other competing water uses. This research aims to evaluate the perceptions of and preferences for irrigation use and management in a rural area, and it does so through an analysis of stakeholder attitudes in a large irrigation system in Southern France: the Neste System. The stakeholder analysis approach and the governance model approach are applied in combination with a new form of graphical representation to evaluate the conflicting points of view between stakeholder's profiles, which are called TIMA. Results revealed that there are heterogeneities between the preferences of stakeholder groups regarding water resources management, agricultural practices, and irrigation challenges. Qualitative and graphical results highlight the competing topics, the stakeholder relationships and the ability to secure permanent agreements by promoting participatory development and good governance. These results can be used by the relevant authorities to customize their interventions, knowing beforehand and in a well-structured form which are the different stakeholders' priorities. In this way, more effective avenues of communication can be established in the decision-making processes regarding irrigation challenges.

N1  - Towards eco-efficient agriculture and food systems: selected papers addressing the global challenges for food systems, including those presented at the Conference “LCA for Feeding the planet and energy for life” (6-8 October 2015, Stresa &amp; Milan Expo, Italy)
N2  - Meeting the growing food demand with minimum impact on the environment is a major challenge to face for ensuring a more sustainable food production. To tackle this problem, in this article we present a novel systematic method for agriculture planning that optimally allocates rainfed and irrigated cropping areas, thereby enhancing food availability and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. The allocation problem is mathematically formulated as a multi-objective linear programming problem that simultaneously accounts for the maximisation of the crop production and the minimisation of the environmental impact caused by water consumption. To quantify the environmental damage, life cycle assessment principles and water footprint concepts are integrated into the model. The capabilities of our tool are illustrated through its application to a real case study that considers wheat production in Spain. The results show that the current allocation of rainfed and irrigated wheat areas in Spain is sub-optimal. Our tool provides a set of alternatives for optimally reallocating these wheat areas that ultimately achieve significant reductions in environmental impact while maintaining or even increasing the production level. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the optimal allocation of rainfed and irrigated cropping areas is a potential pathway to minimise the environmental impact of water consumption in food production. Our systematic decision-support tool aims to assist famers and policy-makers in the transition towards a more sustainable agricultural sector.

N2  - The microbial requirements defined in many quality assurance guidelines and standards of primary production demand the establishment of microbial sampling programs. Recently, a q-PCR Escherichia coli assay has been reported as a good method to quantify the presence of fecal indicator bacterial in groundwater samples. This study focuses on the optimization, validation and application of a qPCR method combined with propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment to exclude DNA from dead cells. A first screening consisting of six primer sets targeting single and multi-copy of E. coli were tested to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay. After that, four primer sets were selected, combined with PMA treatment and their capacity to distinguish viable cells when combined with a background of dead cells was assessed. A primer set targeting the 23S rRNA gene was 10-fold more sensitive than the rest of primers, enabling the detection of low concentrations of viable E. coli cells. This assay also exhibited good repeatability and reproducibility, which indicates the robustness of the method. Optimized and validated PMA-qPCR was used to enumerate E. coli in environmental samples including irrigation water and fresh produce. The results were compared with the levels quantified using qPCR and cultivation-based techniques. Counts of E. coli using plate count assay were significantly lower than the levels obtained by molecular techniques (PMA-qPCR and qPCR) in both irrigation water and fresh produce. E. coli PMA-qPCR enumeration method showed similar results as qPCR quantification, although the PMA-qPCR treatment seemed to a good alternative to distinguish between viable and dead cells. It can be concluded that the optimized PMA-qPCR assay can be used by the industry in microbial sampling programs, helping them with the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).

N2  - There are large areas of moderately Cd-contaminated rice paddies (Cd content was less than risk intervention value) in southwest China, under natural conditions, the effect of irrigation water system's distribution on the Cd contamination in soil and rice is still less accurate. In this study, a survey of paired soil-rice (n = 1520) samples was conducted in a large paddy of about 7000 ha in southwest China that originated from the same parent material and grew with the same rice varieties. Specially, three representative characteristic regions (area A, B, C) were selected from north to south to thoroughly investigate the reasons for pollution characteristics. Background soil, irrigation water and sediment, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer were sampled to study the causes of pollution. Results showed the biological accumulation factor (BAF = C (rice Cd)/C (soil Cd)) of area C in the south reached 1.34, which was about 8 times higher than that of area A in the north. The uneven distribution of irrigation water due to geographical reasons was the most important factor leading to this pollution characteristics. The Cd content in soil of north was much higher than that in the south due to the history of Cd-contaminated irrigation and background content of Cd. During farmland formation, river impinges resulted in a gradual decrease in both Cd content and pH in the background soil from north to south. Both of historical polluters and major irrigation systems were distributed in area A. However, when sewage irrigation stopped about 30 years ago, long-term weakly alkaline irrigation increased the pH of the soil from acidic to neutral in area A. Meanwhile, flooding irrigation in area A reduced the absorption of Cd by roots compared area C where was rarely flooded during the rice planting process due to the lack of irrigation water.

N2  - Modern ecologico-cybernetic principle is of importance to decreasing damages in relation to agricultural productions. As an illustration of this, the authors studied some of the questions about the optimal policy of choosing actions for the antifrost measures of winter wheat by means of the finite-stage model of Markov Decision Programming (MDP). The related data came from the investigation results of the investigated region in the northeastern part of Henan, China. First, the authors give the states, ecologico-cybernetic action measures, transition probabilities and reward values in relation to these antifrost action measures of winter wheat crop. Second, the authors describe the principles and computational procedures of the ecologico-cybernetic decision-makings based on the finite-stage model of MDP. Third, a simple table applicable to the decision-making practice is given. Finally, we evaluate the results of this study, point out their shortcomings and suggest that this method is applicable to the other fields in relation to decreasing damage ecologico-cybernetics.

N2  - The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features – indicative of reduction-oxidation processes – were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers ~0.4 to ~4dSm−1) and drier (water level>−1.5m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers ~2 to ~9dSm−1 and water level between −1m depth and +0.2m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh>+500mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (~+100mV<Eh<~+350mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh<~+100mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem.

N2  - Irrigation water has been highlighted as a source of microbial contamination in produce. Water treatment has been recommended as an intervention strategy to reduce microbial risks associated to irrigation water. Commercial water treatments mostly depend on chemical agents; although growers search for greener alternatives to chemical biocides. Ultrasounds (US) have been proposed as an environmentally friendly technology for irrigation water. In the present study, the suitability of two US treatments (20kHz: US20 and 40kHz: US40 at a specific energy (Es) of 745J/L) and one chlorine treatment (1–2ppm free chlorine) was evaluated and compared to the untreated control. Five water reservoirs belonging to five commercial intensive farms were selected as representative of irrigation practices generally used in south of Europe. All tested water treatments were able to reduce microbial loads, including Escherichia coli (0.5–0.6 log units), to values that were accepted in most of the recommended guidelines of good agricultural practices (≤2logunits). The obtained reductions were lower than those previously reported for these water treatment technologies in lab-scale tests. High microbial reductions are commonly obtained in laboratory studies, yielding impressive results. However, when the same treatments are applied under real commercial conditions, microbial reductions are usually less impressive. All water treatments were able to reduce COD of irrigation water when compared to the untreated control. COD reductions obtained using chlorine (≥430mg/L) and US 20 (~100mg/L) were higher than those observed using US 40 (<50mg/L). The impact of the water quality on the efficacy of US treatments was evaluated in two types of water including surface water and treated wastewater. It was found that the quality of the irrigation water significantly influences the efficacy of the ultrasound treatment. Correlations between indicator parameters have been also evaluated. Obtained results showed that high algae counts were well correlated with high levels of coliforms and E. coli. It could be concluded that US can be proposed as an alternative water treatment to chemical treatments to preserve microbial quality of irrigation water stored in water reservoirs reducing the environmental impact.

N2  - We investigated whether three different types of moss transplants (devitalized moss bags with and without cover and auto-irrigated moss transplants) are suitable for use as biomonitors of the deposition of oxidised and/or reduced forms of N. For this purpose, we determined whether the concentration of atmospheric NO2 was related to the % N, δ15N and the activity of the enzyme biomarkers phosphomonoesterase (PME) and nitrate reductase (NR) in the tissues of moss transplants. We exposed the transplants in 5 different environments of Galicia (NW Spain) and Cataluña (NE Spain): industrial environments, urban and periurban environments, the surroundings of a cattle farm and in a monitoring site included in the sampling network of the European Monitoring Programme. The results showed that the moss in the auto-irrigated transplants was able of incorporating the N in its tissues because it was metabolically active, whereas in devitalized moss bags transplants, moss simply intercepts physically the N compounds that reached it in particulate or gaseous form. In addition, this devitalization could limit the capacity of moss to capture gaseous compounds (i.e. reduced N) and to reduce the oxidised compounds that reach the specimens. These findings indicate that devitalized moss transplants cannot be used to monitor either oxidised or reduced N compounds, whereas transplants of metabolically active moss can be used for this purpose. Finally, the NR and PME biomarkers should be used with caution because of the high variability in their activities and the limits of quantification should be evaluated in each case.

N2  - A series of reliable and cost-effective microbioassay-based techniques for routine water quality monitoring were developed and tested on a recently developed irrigation area in western Spain. Results from these assays were compared to a screening-level risk characterisation based on pesticide concentrations in water samples from the study area. The levels of 147 pesticides were measured in irrigation channels, fluvial water and selected animal (Red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii) and plant (Willow, Salix spp. and Holm Oak, Quercus ilex) tissue. The presence of 59 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals in the watershed was also explored. Mitochondrial activity (tetrazolium salts reduction), lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid method), chlorophyll content (autofluorescence) and total amount of DNA (Hoechst fluorimetry) were evaluated in fern (Soft shield fern, Polystichum setiferum) spores and gametophytes as markers of effects on plant development. Lipid peroxidation was assessed as a measure for acute animal toxicity in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Pollution by pesticides (atrazine, diuron, molinate and oxadiazon) and pharmaceuticals (caffeine, cotinine, ivermectine, nicotine and paraxanthine) was detected in water courses receiving irrigation drainage. Pesticide traces were detected in red swamp crayfish (oxadiazon), and Holm oak leaves (oxadiazon, terbutilazine) but not in willow leaves. Preliminary risk assessment described potential moderate or high risk in the lower waters of both studied rivers. The battery of bioassays was able to detect toxicity in the waters of the lower Gargáligas as well as toxic effects on the waters from the irrigation channel. Such methods could both cut costs and improve the prognostic capability of current monitoring programmes.

N2  - In the era of extreme weather events, plant resistance to excessive water should be considered for plantations in frequently flooded areas to ensure their maximum survival and conservation of natural habitats. Therefore, we quantified the resistance to excessive irrigation (REI) in seedlings of six conifer species on the basis of their morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits. Two different irrigation regimes, natural precipitation as a control treatment and additional irrigation by sprinklers (30.89 ± 2.80% above natural precipitation) as excessive irrigation, were applied for three consecutive years. The changes in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits under long-term excessive irrigation were species-specific. There were three distinct responses in biomass accumulation: drought-susceptible Chamaecyparis obtusa and Abies holophylla significantly increased their aboveground and underground biomass and showed a strong REI; Pinus thunbergii and P. densiflora, both resistant to drought, significantly decreased their aboveground and underground biomass and showed a weak REI. Larix kaempferi and Pinus koraiensis showed a medium REI with only aboveground biomass increment in the former and no biomass change in the latter. Plant biomass responses corresponded well with the changes in morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits. Biomass augmentation resulted from an increase in leaf size, leaf mass per area (LMA), maximum photosynthesis rate, and leaf water potential. Flavonoids, LMA, and stomatal conductance are the most important traits to assess species REI. This study elucidates plant responses to excess water and traits that drive their tolerance. The findings will help in the selection of species for flood-tolerant afforestation programs and establishment of sustainable forests in regions with increased frequency and severity of excessive rainfall.

N2  - The effect of drought on the growth and development of bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) was studied in controlled-environment glasshouses in the UK. There were three landraces (S19-3, DipC and UN from Namibia, Botswana and Swaziland, respectively) and two watering regimes; a control that was irrigated weekly to 90% field capacity and a drought treatment with no irrigation from 49 days after sowing (DAS) until final harvest (147DAS). Bambara groundnut responded to drought by reducing the rate of leaf area expansion, final canopy size and total dry matter (TDM) during vegetative growth. Drought also caused significant reductions in pod dry matter (PDM), pod number, seed weight and harvest index (HI), leading to a decrease in final pod yield that was different between landraces. Across landraces, drought reduced mean pod yield from 298gm−2 to 165gm−2, representing 45% yield loss. Despite the reduction in all landraces, the mean pod yield across the droughted treatments that had received no water for almost 100 days indicated the resilience of the species to drought. The three landraces differed in their phenology; S19-3 exhibited a reduced phenology while UN maintained the longest life cycle. The different responses of the landraces reflect their adaptation to their local climates where mean annual rainfall ranges between 365mm (Namibia) and 1390mm (Swaziland). We discuss the significance of these results for future breeding programmes on bambara groundnut.

N2  - Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) has been proposed as a method for evaluating water use efficiency (WUE) in C3 plants and as a precise technique for screening plants with higer tolerance under water deficit conditions. In this research, 18 alfalfa genotypes from different geographical origins were evaluated under irrigated and rain-fed conditions in organically managed fields in Austria. Significant differences were found amongst harvests for Δ-shoot under both conditions while genotype by harvest interaction was only significant under irrigated condition. Drought stress under rain-fed condition reduced the overall mean of water use efficiency and carbon isotope discrimination responses(up to 34%), but the ratios of reduction differed for characters and genotypes. Narrow ranges were found for all traits especially for WUE-TBY (total biomass yield) (0.78kgm−3) and Δ-shoot (0.53‰) based on genotype means over locations and years, although variation and ranges were higher under irrigated condition. Regarding the variable and low correlations, simultaneous assessment of genotypes for Δ-shoot and biomass production can ensure the selection of superior genotypes and minimize potential biomass reductions that may result from using Δ-shoot as the only selection criterion to improve WUE. Sitel was the most water use efficient genotype(2.79 and 4.48kgm−3 based on shoot dry matter and total biomass,respectively) across two condition (widely adapted genotype) followed by Mohajeran, Fix232 and Verko under irrigated condition (as specific adapted genotypes) and Vlasta, Sanditi, Ghara-aghaj under rain-fed condition.

N2  - Sapota (Manilkara zapota) is an important evergreen fruit crop cultivated in the tropics with a high market potential. However its phenology has been poorly described. The present study defines codes and phenological stages of sapota according to the extended BBCH (Biologische Bundesantalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie) scale using three-digit numerical system. A total of 7 principal growth stages, viz., bud, leaf and shoot development, reproductive development, flowering, fruit development and fruit maturation have been described. In addition, 41 secondary growth stages have also been described. The description of the phenological stages is combined with illustrations for clarification. Moreover, the sequential progression of principal growth stages has been presented to describe growth pattern and climatic requirements for different phases. The extended BBCH scale for sapota is broadly applicable because it describes all the phenophases pertaining to vegetative and reproductive stages and their relative importance in crop management and crop improvement. The study will act as a tool for adoption of better crop management practices (nutrient management, flower and fruit drop management, irrigation scheduling, monitoring and management of pests and timely harvest of fruits), crop improvement, characterization of germplasm and impact assessment of climate change on phenology.

N2  - In the lowlands of Central Asia, summer grown potato is increasingly affected by soil moisture deficit due to inadequate irrigation and high evaporative demand. Many farmers cannot apply irrigation schedules that fully respond to the water demand because of reduced water availability throughout the Aral Sea basin, caused by global warming, and the competing use of irrigation by the cotton crop. The effects of different irrigation regimes were evaluated on ten potato clones in the lowlands of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, during the summer cropping season (July–October) of three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010). The applicability of a growth model to predict yield under the different water regimes was tested. Significant treatment and genotype effects on yield and yield components were observed. The significant correlation for tuber yield among treatments suggested that yield under water limitation was driven more by potential yield than water restriction tolerance. Tuber yield was more associated to tuber weight than to tuber number, a component already largely determined when the different water treatments were initiated. The reduction of water supply after tuberization had a limited effect on yield and consequently drastically enhanced water use efficiency. It increased starch and dry matter content, but decreased vitamin C content. Some clones maintained high yield across years and treatments and appeared as good candidates for being recommended to farmers. Others showed interesting quality traits and are proposed for use as progenitors in breeding programs targeting at the improvement of the nutritional value of potato. A good prediction of yield was obtained using the growth model except for year 2009 when trials were heavily affected by weed infestation. The present study contributes to the improvement of water management and the identification of clones with high tuber yield and quality for the lowlands of Tashkent. Additional experiments are required to address the constraints to potato cultivation in other agro-climatic zones of Central Asia.

N1  - Water use efficiency and integrated water resource management
N2  - We examine relationships between nationwide sparing use of water and farmer income of China in this article. As increasing implementation of water projects and irrigation system, the cost of water use has increased in many regions. However, as local policy-oriented urban expansion and ecological restoration have carried out during the past decade, water demand has increased. The spatial distributions of water use and farmer income are uneven and their relationships are ambiguous over time, especially it is uncertain that farmers can benefit from those so called water-saving programs when urban expansion grows faster in China. Based on consumption theory, empirical results of Blundell–Bond dynamic panel-data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators indicate saving one percent of water has positive impacts at 0.085–0.35 percent on farmer income in the following statistical year. Population has negative impacts on farmer income. Particularly in Central China, one percent of increase in population will statistically significantly decrease 0.276 percent of contemporaneous farmer income. Particularly, in Eastern China with large population during years 2004 through 2012, the total amount of water use increases one percent, contemporaneous farmer income loses 0.04 percent. Thus, saving water can benefit future farmer income, and it indicates that urban expansion may induce the diversion of resources and agricultural production from rural to urban area. Policy implication of relationships between water allocation and farmer income distribution caused by water-saving programs needs to be further studied at regional scale, in particularly to the regions with large population and urban expansion in China.

N2  - Study region
The Sirikit Dam in the Nan River Basin is located on a main tributary of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand.
Study focus
This study investigates forecasting river flows and real-time optimization of dam release using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble weather forecasting for reservoir operations which provide hydropower and irrigation facilities in Thailand during a case study of the 2019 drought event. Medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real-time reservoir inflow. Real-time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions.
New hydrological insights for the region
The medium-range ensemble precipitation forecast conducted by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was used to quantify precipitation for the study basin. The ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season. The initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real-time inflow forecast. To determine the initial conditions of the model, the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed precipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period. This method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real-time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data. The resulting information will be useful for water resource management, which may be adapted to other basins in the study region.

N2  - Intensification of groundwater irrigation is central to goals of improving food security and reducing chronic poverty faced by millions of rural households across the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP) of Nepal and parts of eastern India. At present, levels of groundwater use and access in the EIGP lag far behind other areas of South Asia despite abundant available groundwater resources. A key reason for prevailing access constraints is the dependence on diesel pumpsets for accessing groundwater, which are typically unsubsidised and therefore expensive to purchase and operate. To date, efforts to reduce access costs have focused almost exclusively on how to incentivise adoption of alternative electric or solar-powered pumping technologies, which are viewed as being cheaper to operate and less environmentally damaging due to their lower operational carbon emissions. In contrast, there has been little attention paid to identifying opportunities to make existing diesel pump systems more cost effective for farmers to operate in order to support adaptation to climate change and reduce poverty. In this study, we use evidence from 116 detailed in-situ pump tests along with interviews with pumpset dealers, mechanics and farmers in the Nepal Terai to assess how and why fuel efficiency and operational costs of diesel pump irrigation are affected by farmers’ pumpset selection decisions. We show that costs diesel pumpset irrigation can be reduced significantly by supporting and incentivising farmers (e.g., through equipment advisories, improved supply chains for maintenance services and spare parts) to invest in newer low-cost, portable and smaller horsepower pumpset designs that are more effectively matched to local operating conditions in the EIGP than older Indian manufactured engines that have historically been preferred by farmers in the region. Such interventions can help to unlock potential for intensified irrigation water use in the EIGP, contributing to goals of improving agricultural productivity and resilience to climate extremes while also strengthening farmers capacity to invest in emerging low-carbon pumping technologies.

N2  - Estimation of crop yields included in the planning is an essential condition for accurate and timely agricultural planning. Remotely sensed products, such as the spectral vegetation index (VI), are widely used in estimation of crop yields. The integration of remotely sensed data into machine learning methods will have the potential to develop a real-time management system specific to the area of interest. The main aim of the study was to determine the eggplant yield in field conditions, based on VIs obtained from a handheld spectroradiometer, using five different machine learning methods (artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVR), k nearest neighbor (kNN), random forests (RF), and Adaptive boosting (AB)), and compare the performances of the methods. The data used in the study were obtained in field experiments focusing on determining the most suitable irrigation program for eggplant production in a semi-humid climate region in northern Turkey during 2015, 2016 and 2017 growing seasons. Irrigation treatments consisted of a total of five applications, which were full water application (I1:100 %) and different deficit ration of full water application (I2:I1x 75 %, I3: I1x50%, I4:I1x25% and I5: rainfed based). Input variables used in yield estimation models were determined by correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). The inputs in the models were different combinations of 10 different VIs, the number of days after planting (DAP) and water application coefficients. In addition, an alternative approach was proposed, in which PCA components were used as input for yield estimation. All machine learning models using PCA-based inputs were estimated with higher accuracy than other input combinations. The best results were obtained with the ANN model based on PCA-based inputs; therefore, this model was chosen for eggplant yield estimation (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.973, mean absolute error (MAE) = 274.816 kg ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 352.787 kg ha−1 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.951). The lowest accuracy for yield estimation was recorded in RF model. The prediction accuracy of the models using a single VI as input was low. Green index (GI) and green vegetation index (GVI) had the highest impact on eggplant yield, and eggplant yield was estimated with higher accuracy with these indices, which are sensitive to chlorophyll absorption. The findings of the current study demonstrate the benefits of using remotely sensed data and PCA together in machine learning models to more reliably and accurately estimate eggplant yield at regional scale.

N2  - Irrigated rice contributes the most to rice production globally and in most of rice producing countries. As with other rice production ecosystems, genotype and growing environment are the main factors influencing grain yield (GY) in irrigated rice production. However, the relative importance of genotype, environment and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) on GY is less studied for irrigated rice, although evaluation of candidate varieties for yield stability through multi-environment trials before release and registration is mandatory in many countries. To identify patterns of genotype, environment, and GEI for GY of irrigated lowland rice, 392 cultivars or advanced breeding lines mostly from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), PhilRice (Philippines) and a few breeding programs of other countries were evaluated for GY and related traits in eight environments including Jiangxi (JX) and Sichuan (SC) in China, and six season (2) and nitrogen rate (3) combinations at IRRI headquarters (Los Baños, Philippines). Wide ranges of variations across genotypes and environments were observed for all traits. Genotype, environment, and GEI all significantly affected GY and some of the yield associated traits. GEI was more important than genotypic main effect for GY, seed setting rate and the number of panicles per plant but less important for other traits. For GY, the genotype-by-season interaction and genotype-by-season-by-nitrogen interaction was more important than the genotype-by-nitrogen interaction. The 303 genotypes with GY data in all environments were clustered into ten groups based on GY using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. The eight environments were grouped into three groups based GY using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis. Three nitrogen rates in the WS and SC were grouped together (E1), while three nitrogen rates in the DS formed another group (E2). JX alone was the third group (E3). Genotype groups GG9 and GG3 had the highest GY across the eight testing environments. GG9 had the highest yield in E1 and E2 while GG10 was the best in E3.

N2  - CONTEXT: Agroforestry systems are widely promoted for their economic and
environmental benefits. Food, energy, water and land resources in
agroforestry systems are inextricably intertwined and expected to be
severely impacted by climate change. Socioeconomic development and
increasing populations have posed unique challenges for meeting the
demand for food, energy, water and land, and the challenge will become
more pressing under projected resource shortages and eco-environmental
deterioration. Thus, a method of optimizing and sustainably managing the
water-land-food-energy nexus in agroforestry systems under climate
change must be developed.
OBJECTIVE: This paper develops an optimization model framework for the
sustainable management of limited water-land-food-energy resources in
agroforestry systems under climate change. The aims are to (1) quantify
the interactions and feedbacks within water, land, food and energy
subsystems; (2) provide trade-offs among water and energy utilization
efficiency, economic benefits and environmental protection in
agroforestry systems; and (3) generate optimal policy options among
water and land resources for different crops and woodlands in different
regions under different climate change patterns.
METHODS: The model framework is based on multiobjective fractional
programming, and compromise programming is used to solve it. Climate
change patterns are obtained from atmospheric circulation models and
representative concentration pathways. The above aims are investigated
through an actual nexus management problem in northeast China.
Spatiotemporal meteorological and report-based databases, life cycle
assessments, Pearson correlation analyses, data envelopment analyses and
analytic hierarchy processes are integrated to realize practical
application.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that climate variation will
change the water and land allocation patterns and these changes will be
more pronounced for major grain-producing areas. The optimized water
allocation decreased (especially for rice, e.g., the optimal average
value of the irrigation quota of rice was 4226 m(3)/ha, while the
corresponding actual irrigation requirement of rice was {[}4200-7200]
m(3)/ha) to improve the water use efficiency, and surface water
allocation accounted for two-thirds. Maize had the largest planting
area, although planting soybean generated the most greenhouse gases
(greenhouse gas emissions from field activities for rice, maize, and
soybean were 43.46%, 84.06% and 91.16%, respectively); However, these
gases can be absorbed by forests. The model improved the harmonious
degree of the resource-economy-environment system from 0.24 to 0.56
after optimization.
SIGNIFICANCES: Integrated models contribute to the sustainable
management of water, food, energy and land resources and can consider
the complex dynamics under climate change. It can be used as a general
model and extended to other agroforestry systems that show inefficient
agricultural production.

N2  - This study aimed at investigating the performance of multiple irrigation zoning scenarios on a 73ha irrigated field located in west Tennessee along the Mississippi river. Different clustering methods, including k-means, ISODATA and Gaussian Mixture, were selected. In addition, a new zoning method, based on integer linear programming, was designed and evaluated for center pivot irrigation systems with limited speed control capability. The soil available water content was used as the main attribute for zoning while soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), space-borne satellite images and yield data were required as ancillary data. A good agreement was observed among delineated zones by different clustering methods. The new zoning method explained up to 40% of available water content variance underneath center pivot irrigation systems. The ECa achieved the highest Kappa coefficient (=0.79) among ancillary attributes, hence exhibited a considerable potential for irrigation zoning.

N2  - Context
The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood systems and food security has not yet been well understood.
Objectives
This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments.
Methods
A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed.
Results and conclusion
The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes.
Significance
This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.

N2  - Forty-five days old tomato plants grown in pot and 122 days old tomato plants grown in field were compared for drought responses. The relationships between young and mature plants responses will be useful to shorten the drought breeding process and it will not be necessary to grow the melon plants until the mature stage. Therefore time, labor and money can be saved in the drought breeding programs. Twenty-four different tomato genotypes were used for the pot and field experiments. The stomatal conductance, membrane injury, leaf water potential, leaf osmotic potential, leaf temperature, leaf Ca and K concentrations, shoot fresh weight and the visual shoot appearance by the 1-5 scale evaluation were investigated. The degree of the drought stress was 50% irrigation of the control plants. The main results of the tomato research were: 1) The data relative to control showed definitely higher relationships than the data in absolute under the drought, 2) The most important relationships between young and mature tomato plants that can be used to shorten screening/breeding process were stomatal conductance (r = 0.608), leaf calcium (Ca) concentration (r = 0.573), membrane injury index (r = 0.510), leaf water potential (r = 0.499), shoot fresh weight (r = 0.477), shoot damage visual scale appearance (r = 0.314) and the leaf potassium concentration (r = 0.2043), respectively.

extensive areas of thin soil and rapid water flow to groundwater. In the
southwest China karst region, poor farming decisions can promote land
degradation and reduce water quality with negative consequences for
livelihoods in a region where farmers already suffer from the highest
national poverty rates. Targeting management advice to farmers through
knowledge exchange and decision support can help alleviate land use
impacts on the karst environment but first requires baseline knowledge
of how local farming communities understand and approach soil and water
management. We used a catchment-wide survey (n = 312 individuals in
seven villages) to investigate differences in environmental awareness,
catchment understanding, and farming practices amongst farmers and
community leaders in a typical karst catchment in southwest China. Age,
gender and village of residence of farmers showed an association with
the type of challenges perceived to be most serious. Access to labour,
issues of water quantity and/or quality affecting irrigation, and
fertiliser costs were recognised as being particularly problematic for
the viability of farming. Sources of information used to learn about
farming practices, the environment and fertiliser use were more diverse
for younger (< 40 yr old) farmers and levels of training and acquired
knowledge regarding land management practices varied significantly
between villages in the catchment. The identification of significant
associations between villages or sample demographics, and a variety of
questions designed to understand farmer attitudes and their
environmental awareness, provide clearer insight upon which knowledge
exchange and training programmes can be co-designed with catchment
stakeholders. This has the potential to lead to improved farming
practices with co-benefits for farmers and the environment; helping
sustain ecosystem services for impoverished communities in fragile karst
ecosystems.

N2  - Recycled water is one potential solution to meeting the growing demand for irrigation water in the U.S. and worldwide. However, widespread adoption of recycled water by agriculture will depend on consumers’ acceptance of food crops grown with this water. In a revealed-preference dichotomous-choice framed field experiment, this study elicits consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for fresh produce irrigated with recycled water. It also evaluates consumers’ behavioral responses to information about benefits and potential risks of recycled irrigation water. The results suggest that consumers are less willing to pay for produce irrigated with recycled water than for produce irrigated with water of an unspecified type. Information about potential risks associated with recycled water reduces consumers’ WTP by nearly 50% while information about its environmental benefits does not have a substantial impact. However, a behavioral intervention that presents individuals with a balanced information treatment leads to a 30% increase in mean WTP for produce irrigated with recycled water relative to the experimental control. However, this effect is only found with vegetables and not with fruit, perhaps because fruit is usually consumed raw. Most of the demographic characteristics analyzed in the experiment did not influence consumers’ likelihood of purchasing produce irrigated with recycled water; the exception was presence of a child in the household—those consumers were less likely to purchase produce, particularly fruits, irrigated with recycled water. Finally, consumers experience welfare gains from a labeling policy that provides information about the use of recycled irrigation water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The present work was carried out to evaluate the molluscicidal activity of two pesticides (Chlorpyrifos and Profenophos) against Bulinus truncatus snails. Also, the effect of these pesticides on the survival rate, egg production, growth rate and hermaphrodite gland of B. truncatus snails was carried out. In addition, the effect of these pesticides on the infection of B. truncatus with Schistosoma haematobium as well as on free living stages of S. haematobium (miracidia and cercariae) was studied. Exposure of B. truncatus to these pesticides reduced (P<0.001) their survival rate, egg production and growth rate. This was confirmed by histological examination that showed a severe damage in the hermaphrodite gland cells of treated snails. The results obtained also showed that infection of B. truncatus with S. haematobium miracidia was greatly reduced by exposure to LC25 of these pesticides and also, the total number of shedding cercariae per snail and the period of cercarial shedding were decreased. The mortality rates of miracidia and cercariae were elevated gradually by increasing the concentration of the testes pesticides. It is concluded that Chlorpyrifos and Profenophos may be helpful in schistosomiasis control as they interfere with the snails’ biology and their production of the infective stage (cercariae).

N2  - Quantifying the surface runoff losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at the regional scale is still challenging, mainly due to the model deficiencies and the lack of high-resolution data of agricultural management practices. Here, we re-evaluate N and P runoff losses from single, early and late rice systems in China, using a newly-developed model that was constrained by 127 rainfall-runoff events in 11 sites and driven by the fertilization and irrigation schemes from national surveys covering most of rice-producing provinces. Results show that national N and P runoff losses from rice paddies were 272.6 ± 101.2 Gg N yr−1 and 17.0 ± 6.4 Gg P yr−1, which were 38% and 12% less than previous model estimates, respectively, but 43% more than those of the first National Pollution Census Program (NPCP). The hotspots of N and P runoff losses were identified, most of which occurred in south China (60% of the total), generated during non-fertilization period (>65%), and took place in single rice system (∼50%). These losses might be mitigated by ∼90% through the increase in weir outlet height and the application of shallow-wet irrigation, but remain relatively stable even if optimizing fertilization scheme. The detailed assessment of mitigation potentials highlights an urgency in environmental policy regulation as well as farmers’ accessibility to advanced irrigation technologies, which is expected to inform promotion towards more effective non-point source pollution controls in China and other rice-producing countries.

N2  - Climate change is impacting water resources in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Drought is becoming more severe and water scarcer. Thus, action on adaptation to climate impacts is urgently needed. We assess the potential for wastewater reuse as an adaptation measure to cope with water scarcity in Can Tho City, within the heart of the Mekong Delta. We show that wastewater effluent can be used to irrigate at least to 22,719ha of paddy rice (16% of the rice-cultivated area in the city) at 3 crops per year. The fertilizing properties of the water would eliminate part of the demand for synthetic fertilizers, providing a maximum of 22% of the nitrogen (N) and 14% of the phosphorus (P) requirement for the winter–spring crop. On a yearly basis, recovery of wastewater could reduce the discharge of N by 15–27% and the discharge of P by 8–17%. Such a program would contribute to a decrease in the level of pollution in the local rivers and canal systems, while also reducing the need for expensive tertiary treatment

N2  - Assessments of a stable channel were done to evaluate the conditions of three rivers in Malaysia, using an analytical method that modifies the stable channel flowchart developed by Chang (1988) and Ariffin (2004). The analytical approach was selected to calculate the suitable dimensions for a stable channel, using equations that describe the physical relation of sediment transport, flow resistance, and dynamic equilibrium. Measured field data were used as the input data for the stable channel program, which then processed the data until the input discharge was equal to the output discharge. However, this method depends on the accuracy of the sediment transport equation that is used in the stable channel design. Existing equations recommended by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), Malaysia, were found to be unsuitable because of their low discrepancy ratio (DR) values, which were below 42%. These are the equations of Engelund and Hansen (1967) and Yang (1979), as well as existing local equations from Ariffin (2004) and Sinnakaudan et al. (2006). Therefore, revised equations were developed in the current study to increase the accuracy of the total bed material load equations for use in Malaysian rivers. The newly revised Ariffin (2004) and Sinnakaudan et al. (2006) equations yielded better DRs of 66.34 and 64.49%, respectively. River assessments done on the Kurau River (a small river), the Muda River (a medium-size river), and the Langat River (a large river) show that these rivers have experienced different levels of erosion. Only the Kurau River was found to have minimal erosion and sedimentation levels. Conversely, stable channel assessments for the Muda River and the Langat River revealed that both rivers had experienced severe erosion, due to excessive sand mining. Almost all the cross section sampling points on the Muda River and Langat River were deeper than the suggested stable channel heights.

N2  - Assessing impacts of climate change on hydrology involves global scale climate projections by General Circulation Models (GCMs), downscaling of global scale projections to regional scale by statistical methods or regional climate models and then use of regional outputs in hydrological simulations. Hydrological simulations considers varying inputs starting with soil characteristics, land cover, vegetation types, control structures to social parameters such as human interventions, irrigation and water use. This makes the model highly parametrized and at the same time highly uncertain due to the non-availability of majority of input parameters. Here, we compare the contributions of uncertainty from hydrological parameterization in the hydrological projections of climate change to that generated from the use of multiple climate models. The Ganga River Basin in India was selected as the study region. For regional climate change projections, we use dynamic downscaling outputs from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) and statistical downscaling outputs from a transfer function forced with 3 GCMs, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH) and MPI (Max Plank Institut) ESM (Earth System Model). Monte-Carlo Simulations (MCS) are performed with 1000 generated sets of sensitive model parameters for each of the GCM-regional model combination. We find that the observed time series of river discharge is reproduced well but with bias in low-flow conditions. This is probably associated with human intervention and poor representation of baseflow in VIC due to the neglected groundwater storage which feed the surface water during low flow condition. The future projections show that the major uncertainty lies across climate models for all the four seasons (MAM, JJAS, ON and DJF) and for all the hydrological variables, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield and river discharge. The uncertainty resulting from the MCS is quite small as compared to the climate model uncertainty. We are unable to find any added value in hydrological simulations by rigorous hydrological calibration and parameterization in absence of many required data, when the forcing meteorological data has huge uncertainty. Our findings highlight the need of convergence of climate models before the studies on hydrological impacts assessment and subsequent development of adaptation strategies.

N2  - Studies of sugarcane varieties grown under water-restrictive conditions are necessary because climate changes may result in insufficient rain for agriculture and selecting or breeding drought-tolerant cultivars will become more and more important. This study aimed to quantify the accumulation and partitioning of biomass, as well as water use efficiency of commercial sugarcane varieties under different soil water availability conditions throughout the growing season. The study was conducted during two cropping cycles in Southeast Brazil (22.7 °S, 47.6 °W). Four soil moisture availability regimens were set up to provide 100, 75, 75* and 50% of the water demand of eight commercial varieties of sugarcane (CTC15, CTC17, RB867515, RB92579, RB931011, RB966928, IAC5000, and NCo376). The total aboveground biomass was measured in both crop cycles. Our results indicate that two Brazilian varieties (CTC15 and CTC17) and one South African variety (NCo376 - Canegrow DSSAT reference), increased their water use efficiency when grown under an irrigation deficit of 75% of normal, without yielding less biomass. We did not observe any change in sucrose content under controlled water deficits; however, the studied varieties showed different biomass partitioning: RB966928 had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks (0.59), while IAC5000 showed the lowest fraction (0.51). We verified that the harvest index for sucrose was not altered by reduced irrigation, but that its variability was attributed to the genotype inherited from traditional breeding programs. Thus, we conclude from these results that increased sugar yield per unit area is only possible nowadays by increasing sugarcane biomass productivity under highly efficient irrigation conditions to minimize the loss of yield from water stress.

N2  - Rainfed transplanted rice (Oryza sativa) is the staple crop of the East
India Plateau, with >80% grown in a rice-fallow on terraced and bunded
hill-slopes ('medium-upland') where it is low yielding and drought-prone
despite high rainfall (>1200 mm). Paper I attributed this to inadequate
ponding for transplanted rice whilst identifying the potential for
risk-free alternative kharif (monsoon period) crops, including
direct-seeded rice grown without ponding ('aerobic' rice), and for
second-cropping with little or no irrigation. Paper II reports research
with Tribal smallholders in Purulia District, West Bengal that aimed to
evaluate these cropping options using a participatory process that
further aimed to `improve the situation' of participating families. The
feasibility of short-duration aerobic rice was confirmed experimentally
in 2007 and 2008 and in wider adoption by farmers in 2010 when
conventional rice could not be transplanted. Best yields in each year
were >4 t ha(-1). Mustard (Brassica juncea) and wheat (Triticum
aestivum) planted after medium-duration rice yielded up to 0.95 t ha(-1)
and 2.6 t ha(-1) with one irrigation of 40-50 mm for establishment; but
modelling suggests there is enough residual soil water after
short-duration (early-maturing) rice to exceed these yields in most
years, even without irrigation. Significant P-fertiliser was required
with these crops to correct acute deficiency. Rainfed vegetables were
grown in the kharif and then adapted by farmers to pre-kharif cropping,
and to the rabi (winter) if they had some access to irrigation.
Monitoring land-use revealed rapid, sustained adoption of more diverse
and intensive cropping, with significant social and economic benefits.
We attributed adoption to the participatory process used, that
strengthened farmer's capacity to innovate. The systems implemented by
farmers needed no expenditure on new water resources, suggesting that
comprehensive watershed development (WSD) is not a prerequisite to
replacing the rigid rice-fallow with safer climate-responsive systems,
although investment in small water harvesting structures may be needed
for rabi vegetable crops. The technology evaluated, plus the process of
intervention that built capacity, together provide a foundation for
wider adoption of less risky cropping systems with greater water
productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The majority of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) produced in the U.S. is planted shortly after the summer rains and subsequently depends on rain or artificial irrigation. Therefore, excessive precipitation and poor soil drainage will cause cowpea plants to suffer temporary waterlogging, reducing the submerged tissue's oxygen level. Although cowpea is sensitive to waterlogging, excessive moisture can induce several morpho-physiological changes with adverse impacts on yield in its early stages of development. The current study subjected 30 cowpea genotypes to 10-days of waterlogging at the seedling stage under a controlled environment. The dynamic changes of 24 morpho-physiological parameters under waterlogging and optimal water conditions were analyzed to understand cowpea's response to waterlogging. Significant waterlogging treatment, cowpea genotypes, and their interactions (P < 0.001) were observed for most of the measured parameters. The results indicated that plant height (PH), leaf area (LA), fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) of cowpea genotypes were significantly decreased under waterlogging compared to the control treatments. Similar results were obtained for net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration rate (E). However, the water use efficiency (WUE) and adventitious roots (ARs) increased linearly under waterlogging conditions. Waterlogging also declined chlorophyll fluorescence parameters except non-photochemical quenching (qN), which increased with excess soil moisture. In addition, waterlogging tolerance coefficient (WTC) and multivariate analysis (MCA) methods were used to characterize cowpea genotypes for waterlogging tolerance. Accordingly, the cowpea genotype Dagupan Pangasinan, UCR 369, and Negro were classified as waterlogging tolerant, while EpicSelect.4 and ICARDA 140071, as the most waterlogging sensitive. The cowpea genotypes and morpho-physiological traits determined from this study may be useful for genetic engineering and breeding programs that integrate cowpea waterlogging tolerance.

N1  - Special Issue on Climate Change, Water and Security in the Mediterranean
N2  - Accurate monitoring and modeling of soil–plant systems are a key unresolved issue that currently limits the development of a comprehensive view of the interactions between soil and atmosphere, with a number of practical consequences including the difficulties in predicting climatic change patterns. This paper presents a case study where time-lapse minimal-invasive 3D micro-electrical tomography (ERT) is used to monitor rhizosphere eco-hydrological processes in an apple orchard in the Trentino region, Northern Italy. In particular we aimed at gaining a better understanding of the soil–vegetation water exchanges in the shallow critical zone, as part of a coordinated effort towards predicting climate-induced changes on the hydrology of Mediterranean basins (EU FP7 CLIMB project). The adopted strategy relied upon the installation of a 3D electrical tomography apparatus consisting of four mini-boreholes carrying 12 electrodes each plus 24 mini-electrodes on the ground surface, arranged in order to image roughly a cubic meter of soil surrounding a single apple tree. The monitoring program was initially tested with repeated measurements over about one year. Subsequently, we performed three controlled irrigation tests under different conditions, in order to evaluate the water redistribution under variable root activities and climatic conditions. Laboratory calibration on soil samples allowed us to translate electrical resistivity variations into moisture content changes, supported also by in-situ TDR measurements. Richards equation modeling was used also to explain the monitoring evidence. The results clearly identified the effect of root water uptake and the corresponding subsoil region where active roots are present, but also marked the need to consider the effects of different water salinity in the water infiltration process. We also gained significant insight about the need to measure quantitatively the plant evapotranspiration in order to close the water balance and separate soil structure effects (primarily, hydraulic conductivity) from water dynamics induced by living plants.

N2  - Australian rainfed cotton is grown in regions with highly variable rainfall, with in-crop rainfall ranging from 100mm to 800mm. The CSIRO cotton breeding program conducts rainfed germplasm evaluations at its core research site, as well as a number of regional locations. As a direct result of our variable rainfall environment, yields <550kgha−1 are observed in 20% of years. Historically, these low yielding seasons result in variable experimental data with an increased risk of experimental failure as a non-significant result. Therefore, the aim of this research was twofold. Firstly, to develop and evaluate a managed stress environment (MSE) protocol where ‘rainfed’ germplasm evaluations are irrigated when yield is expected to fall below the minimum threshold for our target breeding environment (550kgha−1). Secondly, to assess the reliability of germplasm performance under rainfed conditions and limited water situations, clarifying whether germplasm selected under very dry rainfed conditions has the ability to produce high lint yield in seasons with higher than average rainfall. It was hypothesised that applying one furrow irrigation in very dry seasons will reduce within experiment variability and increase experimental yields to better reflect our breeding target environment. As irrigation timing will impact its efficacy, the OZCOT simulation model for cotton crop management was used to determine the most effective irrigation date with respect to soil water content and crop growth stage. The simulation, conducted with weather data from a 151year period, concluded that yields >550kgha−1 were not achieved in 27 seasons (18%). These 27 seasons underwent further simulations to determine the most suitable soil water content and crop growth stage where yield was increased with a single irrigation. It was determined that an irrigation should be applied to a ‘rainfed’ experiment if plant available water (PAW) reached approximately 40% by peak flowering (100-110 DAS). Paired rainfed and MSE experiments with 21 genotypes were established in 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 to provide field validation of the developed protocol. Genotype performance was assessed in terms of lint yield and fibre quality. Results show that in dry seasons (2013/14) irrigating the ‘rainfed’ treatment was necessary to reduce within experiment variability and increase yields above 550kgha−1. However, once rainfed yield levels increase due to greater in-crop rainfall (2014/15 and 2015/16), irrigation was no longer necessary. This was further supported by the result that genotype yield ranking differed between rainfed and MSE treatments. Genotype changes in fibre quality between treatments were small. It was concluded that a MSE, designed to produce experimental data better matched to our breeding target environment as well as reducing the risk of experimental failure, would be a worthwhile addition to rainfed evaluations conducted in variable rainfall environments.

agricultural irrigation systems and how they shift in response to
various stressors. Here, we leveraged advances in Machine Learning and
availability of very high resolution remote sensing imagery to help
resolve this long-standing issue. To this end, we developed a deep
learning model to classify irrigation systems at a regional scale using
remote sensing imagery. After testing different model architectures,
hyper parameters, class weights and image sizes, we selected a U-Net
architecture with a Resnet-34 backbone for this purpose. We applied
transfer learning to increase training efficiency and model performance.
We considered four irrigation systems as well as urban and background
areas as land use/ cover classes, and applied the model to 8,600 very
high resolution (1 m) images, labeled with ground-truth observations of
irrigation types, in a case study in Idaho, USA. Images were obtained
from the US Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Imagery
Program. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance for
segmentation of different classes on the train data (85% to 94%),
validation data (72% to 86%), and test data (70% to 86%), which
attests to the efficacy of the model for the segmentation of images
based on spatial features. Aside from leveraging deep learning and
remote sensing for resolving the standing real-world problem of multiple
irrigation type segmentation, this study develops and publicly shares
labeled data, as well as a trained deep learning model, for irrigation
type segmentation that can be applied/transferred to other regions
globally. Furthermore, this study offers novel information about the
impacts of transfer learning, imbalanced training data, and efficacy of
various model structures for multiple irrigation type segmentation.

N2  - In the agricultural water resources system, the regional yield is hard to be simulated accurately under the impacts of spatial heterogeneities of soil, weather, and crop types. The optimal water allocation schemes may be not in accordance with actual conditions due to neglecting the actual crop growth process. Meanwhile, the uncertainties in the simulation-optimization models are not easy to be addressed. To deal with the above problems, this paper develops a framework of the distributed AquaCrop simulation nonlinear multi-objective dependent-chance programming (distributed AquaCrop NMOFDCP) for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties. This developed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in China. The 134 homogeneous decision-making units (DMUs) are divided to depict the spatial heterogeneities of the study area, and 472 decision variables (irrigation amount) for 134 DMUs are optimized. Moreover, the model deals with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy goals and tradeoffs relationships between objectives of the yield and water productivity, and measures the satisfactory degrees between objectives and their fuzzy goals. Two groups of Pareto solutions corresponding to the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield, and the maximum satisfactory degree of the water productivity are obtained by the parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) method respectively. In addition, water allocation, satisfactory degree of the yield, and satisfactory degree of water productivity are analyzed at the decision-making unit scale, crop scale, and irrigation-district scale separately. Besides the effects of three weather conditions and four soil types on the system’s outputs are conducted. The results show that weather conditions and soil types have obvious effects on the system’s outputs at three analysis scales, and different water allocation patterns at the growth period affect the yield and water productivity.

N2  - Summary
Lake Tutchewop in southeastern Australia is a former ephemeral wetland that has been used as a saline disposal basin since 1968, forming part of the salinity management of the Murray River. The extent of saline focused recharge from Lake Tutchewop and fresh recharge from nearby unlined irrigation channels was determined using pore water and groundwater stable isotope and major ion chemistry, which were able to separate the influence of lake water, irrigation water and regional groundwater. In ∼45years, saline water from Lake Tutchewop has infiltrated only up to 165m from the lake edge in most directions, due to the underlying relatively impermeable clay-rich sediments, and a maximum of 700m due to preferential groundwater flow along a sandy palaeochannel. The saline leakage has had limited, if any, impact on surrounding agricultural land use. Fresh water leakage from unlined irrigation channels extends up to 10m deep, validating the current program to replace these channels with pipelines. This study demonstrates that focused recharge from different sources can be positively identified where the recharge waters have distinctive compositions, and that underlying clay-rich sediments restrict the extent of seepage. Therefore, management of focused recharge sources, particularly those that could decrease groundwater quality, requires a detailed knowledge of both the groundwater composition around the site and the underlying geology.

N2  - Irrigation is a lynchpin of rural development strategies and a key input to improving productivity and farm incomes, the key source of livelihood for the majority of the world's poor. Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions.

N2  - Background
Adequate bowel preparation is an important colonoscopy quality indicator. Reinforced education is effective in improving bowel preparation quality of colonoscopy with mixed indications. However, it remains unclear whether such improvement can be consistently observed in pre- and post-irrigation during colonoscopy in screening population.
Objective
We aimed to study the effectiveness of nurse-led reinforced education delivered via mobile messenger (WhatsApp Messenger) on pre- and post-irrigation bowel preparation adequacy in colonoscopies for positive fecal immunochemical test in a population-based colorectal cancer screening program.
Design
Randomized controlled trial.
Setting
A hospital-based endoscopy centre in Hong Kong, China.
Participants
Patients undergoing colonoscopy for positive fecal immunochemical test in a population-based colorectal cancer screening program.
Methods
The recruited patients were randomized to receive either WhatsApp Reinforced Education (WRE) or No Reinforced Education (NRE) (1:1). Patients in WRE group received one-off reinforced education of bowel preparation in text and video formats via WhatsApp Messenger four days prior to colonoscopy sent by investigator while NRE group received standard-of-care only. Primary outcome was the bowel preparation adequacy rate as evaluated by Aronchick Scale. Secondary outcomes included bowel preparation adequacy rate as evaluated by Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, adenoma detection rate and risk factors of bowel preparation inadequacy. Continuous variables were described as means with standard deviation (SD) and analyzed with Student's t-test. The Pearson Chi Square Test or Fisher Exact Test was used to assess categorical variables when appropriate. Risk factors were determined by logistic regression.
Results
From July 2017 to April 2019, 685 eligible patients were randomized to WRE (n = 343) and NRE (n = 342) groups. Patients in WRE group had higher bowel preparation adequacy rate as evaluated by Aronchik Scale (83.4% vs 75.4%, p = 0.010) and Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (94.2% vs 88.9%, p = 0.013). Adenoma detection rate was higher in WRE group but without statistical significance (71.4% vs 67.5%, p = 0.27). In logistic regression, WhatsApp Reinforced Education reduced the inadequate bowel preparation risk (Adjusted odds ratio: 0.564; 95% confidence interval: 0.371–0.856, p = 0.007). Male gender (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.638; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.054–2.546, p = 0.028) and diabetes (AOR: 2.062; 95% CI: 1.215–3.497, p = 0.007) were risk factors of bowel preparation inadequacy.
Conclusions
Nurse-led mobile messenger-initiated reinforced education improves both pre- and post-irrigation bowel preparation quality of screening colonoscopy following positive fecal immunochemical test. It is readily incorporable in clinical practice because of its low setup cost.

N2  - Parthenium argentatum (guayule), originated from northern Mexico and southern Texas deserts, is a good candidate for arid and semi-arid sustainable agricultural systems to produce domestic natural rubber and other industrial byproducts. Exploring the genetic and phenotypic diversities of guayule germplasm collections is required for continuous genetic improvement of guayule characteristics to meet the growing demand of guayule for rubber, resin and latex industries. The current study phenotypically evaluated a larger guayule USDA germplasm collection than before, with 56 accessions for 10 important morphological and agronomic traits evaluated, which include plant biomass, rubber and resin content, rubber and resin yield. The accessions were grown under two different irrigation conditions: well-watered and water-stressed environments. Significant genotypic effects were found for all studied traits indicating the wide genetic variability of this collection. Significant Environmental effects were found in rubber content, resin content, rubber yield and dry weight biomass. No significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) were observed indicating the similarity of those accessions across growing conditions. Moderate to high entry-mean heritability values were estimated for these traits, suggesting that selection is feasible to enhance the genetic gain. Significant inter-trait correlations were found between biomass-related traits and resin/rubber yield, as well as ploidy levels and resin/rubber content, indicating the possibility of improving multiple traits at one time. To conclude, this study explored the phenotypic variations of the USDA guayule germplasm under different irrigation conditions, which will provide recommendations for parent and off-spring selections to enhance the breeding values in guayule breeding programs.

N2  - Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), the most prevalent and poisonous type of microcystins (MCs), is generated by the widespread occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms. MCs can enter farmland through irrigation water and will inevitably produce negative effects on terrestrial plants. However, little is known about the molecular toxic processes behind the programmed cell death (PCD) induced by MCs in plants. In the current study, the effects on the viability, oxidative stress, and expressions of PCD-related genes in rice suspension cells were investigated under the MC-LR exposure at different concentrations (5.00, 50.0 and 500 μg L−1). A kinetic model based on the sGompertz growth equation could be used to well fit the growth curve of suspension cells. More than 0.5 days of exposure to MC-LR significantly reduced the cells viability in all treatment groups. MC-LR has a dualistic effect on O2•− and GSH levels in rice cells due to the antioxidant system responses and subcellular damages. Upregulated of the transmembrane protein-encoding gene OsOATPM in cells under MC-LR exposure indicates its involvement in transporting MC-LR. MC-LR treatment could induce significant expression of OsPDCD5 gene (an ortholog to mammalian-programmed cell death 5) and metacaspase family gene OsMC-6 in rice suspension cells, but inhibit the expression of the vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) family genes OsVPE-1 and OsVPE-2. Taken together, MC-LR induces PCD in rice suspension cells, mediated by production of ROS, might primarily through the influence of metacaspase family gene OsMC-6 expression. A reduction in mitochondrial ATP levels under the regulation of mitochondrial energy related gene Os03g278900 might also occur during the MC-LR-induced PCD process.

N2  - In response to a congressional mandate, the US Global Change Research Program organized a National Assessment of Climate Change focusing on geographic regions (e.g. Alaska, Great Plains) and sectors (e.g. public health, agriculture, water resources). This paper describes methodology and results of a study by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory contributing to the water sector analysis. The subsequent paper makes use of the water supply results to estimate the climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture. The vulnerability of water resources in the conterminous US to climate changes in 10-year periods centered on 2030 and 2095 as projected by the Hadley/United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) general circulation model (GCM; HadCM2) were modeled using the Hydrologic Unit Model for the United States (HUMUS). HUMUS, a biophysically based hydrology model, consists of a Geographical Information System (GIS) that provides data on soils, land use and climate to drive the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The modeling was done at the scale of the eight-digit United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydrologic Unit Area (HUA) of which there are 2101 in the conterminous US. Results are aggregated to the four- and two-digit (major water resource region, MWRR) scales for various purposes. Daily records of maximum/minimum temperature and precipitation (PPT) from 1961 to 1990 provided the baseline climate. Water yields (WY), used as a measure of water supply for irrigation, increases from the 1961–1990 baseline period over most of the US in 2030 and 2095. In 2030, WY increases in the western US and decreases in the central and southeast regions. Notably, WY increases by 139mm (35%) from baseline in the Pacific Northwest. Driven by higher temperatures and reduced precipitation, WY is projected to decrease in the Lower Mississippi and Texas Gulf basins. The HadCM2 (2095) scenario projects a climate significantly wetter than baseline, resulting in water yield increases of 38% on average. Water yield increases are projected to be significant throughout the eastern US—39% in the Ohio basin, for example. Water yields increase significantly in the western US, as well—57 and 76% in the Upper and Lower Colorado, respectively. Climate change also affects the seasonality of the hydrologic cycle. Early snowmelt is induced in western basins, leading to dramatically increased water yields in late winter and early spring. The simulations were run at current (365ppm) and elevated (560ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations [CO2] to account for the potential impacts of the ‘CO2-fertilization’ effect. The effects of climate change scenario were considerably greater than those due to elevated [CO2] but the latter, overall, decreased losses and augmented increases in water yield.

N2  - Understanding the variation of soil moisture patterns over time can support field investigative efforts specific to managing irrigation input, environmental risk assessment, or water resource planning. The objective of this study was to apply an integrated suite of traditional (e.g. Vachaud’s time stability analysis) and less common techniques (e.g. confusion matrix, Castrignanò’s average of the differences, cross correlogram analysis, and polygon kriging) to gain deeper insight into the temporal persistence of soil moisture patterns, especially for site-specific water management purposes. This study used soil moisture estimates generated in previous work that was carried out in a field in Central Kentucky for three dates ranging from permanent wilting point up to field capacity. The results obtained from this study provide richer evidence of time stable soil moisture patterns and lend greater insight into the controlling factors of spatial and temporal variation, including soil moisture status, soil physicochemical properties, and landscape position, that otherwise would not be attainable using a single metric alone.

N2  - Aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions —where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction. To tackle this problem, policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies. However, these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction. Estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time-consuming because they vary depending on technology- and location-specific conditions, and their interactions. Thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates, even if rough. This paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies. Our case study is the aquifer of Valle de Aguascalientes, Mexico —where extraction is more than 80% above of the natural recharge. We have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft. These results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in Aguascalientes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Australia currently provides a leading example of a government buying back water for the environment. The Australian Government is at the midpoint of a $3.1 billion programme of buying water for the environment. The current acquisition programme relies heavily on the purchase of water entitlements (the long-term right to receive seasonal water allocations). An alternative acquisition method would be to use time-limited water products such as water allocations (temporary right to use water), entitlement leasing and options contracts. Scenario analysis, the Western US experience and irrigator surveys are used to examine whether the use of such alternative water products may be viable in the Australian context. This approach distributes the costs of transition over a longer period and has the potential to generate several benefits, namely: incremental structural adjustment; increased flexibility; enhanced environmental flows; increased irrigator willingness to participate; and, in some circumstances, increased cost-efficiency. However, the inclusion of alternative water products will involve more complex institutional arrangements and the need for more understanding of the dynamics of water markets and government budgeting processes.

N2  - Water scarcity has become a worldwide phenomenon as a result of climate change. For that reason most countries are adopting various measures to reduce the impact of water scarcity on their agricultural sector and Ghana is no exception. Ghana's agricultural sector is the backbone of the rural economy in the country. The agricultural sector employs about 90 percent of the rural population and contributes extensively to the GDP of the country. But, low productivity and inefficient water use have resulted in a significant threat to the livelihoods of the rural population. The paper used a programing model named MATA (Multi-Analysis Tool for the Agricultural Sector) to achieve the stated objectives. The main objective of the study was to find out the impact of water-pricing policy on the demand for water resources by the farmers in relation to their cropping activities and income. The results of the study indicated that water-pricing policy has a negative impact on the demand for water resources in Ghana. But this impact happens only when water prices are increased significantly. However, if water prices are high it has a negative impact on cropping activities, farmers’ income, employment and crop varieties. Hence the study recommends that in order to at least reduce water wastage in the sector, it be proposed that a price (around 2cedi/m3) might be of significance in order to make farmers conscious of the scarcity of water resources, and to persuade them to adopt water saving technologies without affecting crop distribution. The study also recommends that water-pricing policy should not be used as a policy tool on its own but should be used together with other water saving policies in order to achieve the best results.

N2  - Bamboo shoots have been used by Chinese people as a popular and delicious dish up to 3000 years. Out of 534 bamboo species in China, about 50 species are used as source of edible shoot. However, little or almost no intensive management intervention has been applied for optimum shoot production of clump forming bamboo forest, especially for Dendrocalamus brandisii (Munro) Kurz. Therefore, the present study aimed to: (1) investigate the effects of thinning intensity on D. brandisii shoot production, (2) assess the effects of growth parameters on D. brandisii shoot production, and (3) develop a model to predict shoot production from a 5-year-old D. brandisii plantation. In February, using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) five thinning intensity treatments (1–0, 1-1, 2–1, 2-2 standing culm density (SCD) and control) were established in three blocks along an altitudinal gradient that covered an area of about 0.072 ha. Data collection (number of shoots and shoot yield) was conducted from mid-July to mid-October. A total of 130 edible shoots weighing 278.5 kg were harvested from 0.072 ha. This accounted for 2.89 harvested shoots clump−1 with 3.87 ton ha−1 shoot yield. On average, the largest shoot yield (2.74 kg or 5.84 ton ha−1) was harvested from a 2-2 standing culm density (SCD) (T4). The developed model illustrated that shoot yield was positively and significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with thinning intensity. The model further demonstrated that all culm DBH classes in T4 and/or T3 had the largest shoot yield compared to the control treatment (T5). Despite fewer numbers of shoots in T4 compared to T3, the larger shoot size in T4 made more attractive and promising for D. brandisii shoot production. Future studies should be considered on the combined effect of SCD, fertilizer regime and irrigation scheme for a better understanding about optimum shoot production.

N2  - Foodborne illnesses associated with fresh produce have dramatically increased within the last decade. Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) were developed to address potential sources of pre-harvest microbial contamination, but certification remains low. The majority of mid-Atlantic vegetable farms are fresh market, but limited information is available about what on-farm production practices are being utilized to mitigate food safety risks. Our goal was to assess Maryland and Delaware vegetable producers' understanding and implementation of GAP. An electronic survey on pre-harvest production practices was administered at commercial grower meetings in 2010 and 2013. A total of 313 surveys were analyzed, and Probit regression was used to estimate the average marginal effects of farm scale, years in production and market channel on the probability of using different on-farm food safety practices. Generally, food safety practices did not differ across farm scale or years in production. However, market channel did influence a grower's decision to implement some food safety practices. Growers who marketed their produce primarily through wholesale channels were more likely to: have written policies for how they grew and handled their produce, test their irrigation water at least once a year for microbial contamination, or be GAP-certified. Economic constraints were not reported as the primary obstacle for GAP implementation in either survey. While more research is needed to better understand how market channel influences decision-making activities including on-farm food safety practices, this study highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for GAP educational programs to expand beyond a one-size-fits-all approach.

N2  - A stated choice method evaluates how well water policy responds to the preferences of the rural poor in South Africa. Household priorities to experimental scenarios of water resource and water services attributes are investigated in two communities with poor water access in a semi-arid zone. Results identify improved water accessibility as the most important intervention for social welfare gains, particularly benefiting female water collectors. A latent class specification reveals two sub-groups with different weighted preferences; this specification reinforces the primacy of domestic water access and also identifies a smaller but significant group with preferences for water availability for kitchen garden irrigation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This paper evaluates changes in precipitation in the upper the Euphrates–Tigris basin enclosing the whole area of Southeastern Anatolian Project (GAP), which is the largest investment for regional development in the history of Turkey and the fourth largest irrigation project in the world. For this purpose, the analyses are based on new data sequences formed by summing up monthly precipitation of 19 stations in the study area at seven different time scales. The Mann–Kendal (MK) and Theil–Sen Slope estimator (TSE) statistics to detect the direction and magnitude of an available monotonic trend in any given data, respectively, were used for the statistical analysis of the new data sequences. Besides, the sequential version of Mann–Kendal rank test (SVMK) to detect the approximate starting point of a trend was also applied the data set of the stations with significant monotonic trend. The monotonic trend was detected at 63% of the stations (12 of 19 stations) for the different time scales at 5% significance level. The stations with positive and negative or insignificant precipitation trends were scattered in the different parts of the basin. The significant trends were found in six stations with respect to the critical value (±2.33) from the standard normal distribution for one-sided hypothesis at 1% significance level. The TSE results for 12 stations with monotonic trend at different time scales varied from −2.36mm to 2.51mm per year. Of the six stations, the maximum decrease (−72.5%) and increase (166.9%) in the percent change (PC) were determined in Agri and Bitlis stations, respectively. The approximate starting points of upward and downward trend for Kilis, Sirnak, Agri, Elazig, Bitlis and Siirt stations were at about 1980, 1979, 1987, 1986, 1984 and 1965 with respect to the SVMK test, respectively. According to the results obtained from the previous studies, the river basin is affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and global warming. Therefore, it is very likely that the NAO and global warming have been contributing to changes in precipitation of the river basin.

N2  - In this study, an integrated framework is proposed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy-water nexus. The framework has two components: the optimized interval solutions generation of unknown market quotation and environment situation through the novel interval fuzzy-expectation programming, and the post-optimization decision-making of the tradeoff between system risk and return through risk-explicit interval programming. An optimization model based on the framework was developed from a real description for agricultural water resources system of Guangdong province under considering various crop, multiple water sources, and the related energy consumption in irrigation and drainage. The impact of energy consumption and risk level control on water resources allocation among different crops and system benefits were analyzed. The results indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption, and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints. Risk tradeoff-based results can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon-oriented agricultural water resources management schemes.

N2  - Summary
Genetic Programming is able to systematically explore many alternative model structures of different complexity from available input and response data. We hypothesised that Genetic Programming can be used to test the structure of hydrological models and to identify dominant processes in hydrological systems. To test this, Genetic Programming was used to analyse a data set from a lysimeter experiment in southeastern Australia. The lysimeter experiment was conducted to quantify the deep percolation response under surface irrigated pasture to different soil types, watertable depths and water ponding times during surface irrigation. Using Genetic Programming, a simple model of deep percolation was recurrently evolved in multiple Genetic Programming runs. This simple and interpretable model supported the dominant process contributing to deep percolation represented in a conceptual model that was published earlier. Thus, this study shows that Genetic Programming can be used to evaluate the structure of hydrological models and to gain insight about the dominant processes in hydrological systems.

N2  - The DIDAS software package, based on analytical solutions of linearized
water flow and uptake problems, assists in drip-irrigation system design
and irrigation scheduling. Water flow is described by superposition of
solutions for positive sources (on-surface or subsurface emitters) and
negative sinks (root systems). Steady water flow is assumed in the
design module and unsteady flow in the irrigation scheduling module. The
design tool, based on relative water uptake rate (RWUR) criterion,
assesses the effects on water use efficiency of geometrical attributes:
distances between emitters along drip lines; separation between drip
lines; depth of subsurface emitters; and size and depth of root systems.
Evaluation of the maximum possible RWUR assumes no plant-atmosphere
resistance to water uptake, i.e., the roots are assumed to apply maximum
suction and the water uptake rate depends only on the soil capability to
conduct water from sources to sinks. The RWUR computations require only
three parameters describing the soil texture, the root zone size, and
the potential evaporation, in accounting also for evaporation from the
soil surface. The optimizing tool for irrigation scheduling is based on
a relative water uptake volume (RWUV) criterion. The computations of
diurnal variations of water uptake rates and RWUV for a given irrigation
scenario require additional information on the diurnal pattern of plant
resistance to water uptake and on the soil hydraulic conductivity. DIDAS
also contains a diurnal pattern module for evaluating diurnal
water-uptake patterns; it assumes quasi-steady flow and accounts for the
diurnal variations of plant-atmosphere resistance and evaporation in
fine-tuning the design and in preliminary evaluation of scheduling
scenarios. DIDAS was programmed in Delphi, runs on a PC under the
Windows operating system, and requires no further software. The drip
irrigation scenario is constructed via a few GUI windows, which contain
also a library of the required soil input parameters, and a best-fitting
procedure for determining them. The computed RWURs and RWUVs are
displayed graphically and the tabulated output results can be exported
to, e.g., Microsoft Excel for further processing. An updated DIDAS
version can be downloaded freely from http://app.agri.gov.il/didas. (c)

N2  - Scarcity and competition for water are matters of increasing concern, as are potential shortages of food. These issues intersect both within the agricultural sector and across all water using sectors. Irrigation is by far the largest user of water in most water-scarce countries, and is under pressure to reduce utilisation (to release water to other sectors, including the environment) and use water more productively to meet demands for food and fibre. The terminology for such intra- and inter-sectoral analysis must be unambiguous across sectors so that interventions and their impacts are properly understood. Such terminology, based on previous work and debate, is set out. Implications for a better understanding of the scope for improved productivity of water in agriculture are traced, and some examples are given using data from recent research submissions, demonstrating the benefits of precise water accounting.

N2  - Aquifer overdraft is a major environmental and water management problem in Southeast Spain. In some areas, availability of desalinised seawater resources is being expanding, which provides an opportunity to address this problem at a lower social and economic cost. We analyse the economic impact of using several instruments to address the problem of non-renewable groundwater pumping in the aquifers of the Guadalentín basin: an environmental tax on groundwater use, the buyback of groundwater rights and the subsidization of desalinised resources. Their impact is assessed using a mathematical programming model that maximises the farm net margin resulting from the use of the available water resources for irrigation in the area. Our results show that, in the current situation of water availability, all the alternatives have significant economic impacts. Moreover, the first two alternatives would be unfeasible from a political point of view. The existence of abundant, though expensive, desalinised water resources in the foreseen future would reduce, but not eliminate, the negative economic impact of such instruments. Furthermore, water demand is so high in this area that even strongly subsidising desalinised water in exchange for reducing the use of groundwater would not allow to eliminate aquifer overdraft.

N2  - As the evidence for human induced climate change becomes clearer, so too does the realization that its effects will have impacts on numerous environmental and socio-economic systems. Mountains are recognized as very sensitive physical environments with populations whose histories and current social positions often strain their capacity to accommodate intense and rapid changes to their resource base. It is thus essential to assess the impacts of a changing climate, focusing on the quantity of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow and ice melt represent a large streamflow component as well as a local resource in terms of freshwater supply, hydropower generation, or irrigation. Increasing evidence of glacier retreat, permafrost degradation and reduced mountain snowpack has been observed in many regions, thereby suggesting that climate change may seriously affect streamflow regimes. These changes could in turn threaten the availability of water resources for many environmental and economic systems, and exacerbate a range of natural hazards that would compound these impacts. As a consequence, socio-economic structures of downstream living populations would be also impacted, calling for better preparedness and strategies to avoid conflicts of interest between water-dependent economic actors. This paper is thus an introduction to the Special Issue of this journal dedicated to the European Union Seventh Framework Program (EU-FP7) project ACQWA (Assessing Climate Impacts on the Quantity and Quality of WAter), a major European network of scientists that was coordinated by the University of Geneva from 2008 to 2014. The goal of ACQWA has been to address a number of these issues and propose a range of solutions for adaptation to change and to help improve water governance in regions where quantity, seasonality, and perhaps quality of water may substantially change in coming decades.

N2  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered as a key factor in hydrological and climatological studies, agricultural water management, irrigation scheduling, etc. It can be directly measured using lysimeters. Moreover, other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model ET. In the recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). In the present study, local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and gene expression programming (GEP) were assessed for estimating daily ETo. For this aim, daily weather data of six stations with different climates in Iran, namely Urmia and Tabriz (semi-arid), Isfahan and Shiraz (arid), Yazd and Zahedan (hyper-arid) were employed during 2000–2014. Two types of input patterns consisting of weather data-based and lagged ETo data-based scenarios were considered to develop the models. Four statistical indicators including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to check the accuracy of models. The local performance of models revealed that the MARS and GEP approaches have the capability to estimate daily ETo using the meteorological parameters and the lagged ETo data as inputs. Nevertheless, the MARS had the best performance in the weather data-based scenarios. On the other hand, considerable differences were not observed in the models' accuracy for the lagged ETo data-based scenarios. In the innovation of this study, novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged ETo data-based scenarios through combination of MARS and GEP models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) time series model. It was concluded that the proposed novel models named MARS-ARCH and GEP-ARCH improved the performance of ETo modeling compared to the single MARS and GEP. In addition, the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station' data for estimation of the daily ETo at target station.

N2  - Pure oats in gluten-free diets (GFD) represent important nutritional benefits for people suffering from celiac disease (CD). However, oat cultivars do not contain the typical CD-related wheat gliadin analog polypeptides. Emerging evidence suggests that oat cultivars containing gluten-like epitopes in avenin sequences may pose potential health risks for celiac patients in rare cases, depending on the individual’s susceptibility. Consequently, it is necessary to screen oats in terms of protein and epitope composition, to be able to select safe varieties for gluten-free applications. The overall aim of our study is to investigate the variation of oat protein composition directly related to health-related and techno-functional properties and to examine how the protein compositional parameters change due to irrigation during the grain-filling period as compared to the natural rain-fed grown, in a large winter oat population of different geographic origin. Elements of an oat sample population representing 164 winter oat varieties from 8 countries and the protein composition of resulting samples have been characterized. Size distribution of the total protein extracts has been analyzed by SE-HPLC, while the 70% ethanol extracted proteins were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Protein extracts are separated into 3 main groups of fractions on the SE-HPLC column; polymeric, avenin, and non-avenin monomeric protein groups, representing 59.17–80.87%, 12.89–31.03%, and 3.40–9.41% of total protein content, respectively. The ratio of polymeric to monomeric proteins varied between 1.71 and 6.07. 91 RP-HPLC-separated peaks have been differentiated from the ethanol extractable proteins of the entire population. The various parameters identified a lot of variation, confirming the significance of genotypic variation. In addition, it was also established that the additional water supply during grain filling significantly affected the various quantitative parameters of protein content, but not its qualitative structure. This environmental effect, however, was strongly genotype-dependent. Winter oat genotypes with low levels of epitope content were identified and it was proven that these characteristics were independent of the environmental factor of water availability. These genotypes are appropriate for initiating a specific breeding program to yield oat cultivars suitable for CD patients.

N2  - This paper presents the approach, assumptions, and computational analysis of the preliminary safety assessment, regarding the post-closure period for the disposal of radioactive waste in Greece. The assessment was implemented in the context of the National Program for the disposal of radioactive waste in the country, which is currently in the early stage for the investigation of facility siting. The basis scenario selected for this investigation was the leaching of radionuclides and the exposure in a residence offsite. Moreover, a scenario involving the intrusion in the facility and construction of a dwelling that disturbs the disposal zone is also considered. Due to the significant uncertainties in the current phase, the simulations related to leaching of the waste both in the offsite and intrusion scenarios are based on an uncertainty analysis with 25 site and scenario related parameters. The most important contribution is attributed to Ra-226 with an annual dose equal to about 2 and 3 μSv per MBq disposed, for the offsite and intrusion scenario, respectively. Th-232, Cl-36, C-14, Ag-108m and Pu-239 follow with a dose one order of magnitude less, compared to Ra-226. In the leaching scenarios examined, and for the most dose relevant radionuclides, the exposure related to drinking water from the well and the use of this water to irrigate fruits and vegetables are by far the dominant pathways due to the environmental transfer of the radionuclides and their associated dose coefficients. Th-232 dominates the direct exposure pathways (direct external radiation and plant contamination from the contaminated surface soil) in the intrusion scenario with an annual dose of about 1.4 mSv per Bq/g disposed. Ra-226, Cl-36 and Ag-108m cause exposure levels higher than 0.2 mSv/y per Bq/g disposed in the facility. A wide range was considered for the uncertainty parameters that led to a significant variation in the predicted doses that is expected to envelope the potential exposure for each radionuclide.

N1  - Water, Science, Technology and Policy Convergence and Action by All (A Meeting Point for Action leading to Sustainable Development)
N2  - Botswana being semi-arid and arid country, the provision of drinking water and water for agricultural production is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. Measures that can augment the available sources of water or measures that can reduce the demand on potable water should be given serious consideration. Horticulturists have incorporated new technology into many of their production programs, which has enabled them to grow more horticultural crops with less water; however, more effort is needed. Techniques such as drip irrigation, sensors, growing plants with low water requirements, timing and scheduling of irrigation to the growth needs of the plant, mulching, and establishing a minimum water quality standard for horticultural crops must be used to stretch agricultural water supplies. Recycling agricultural water and using treated municipal sewage effluent is a viable option for increasing horticultures’ future water supply in Botswana. Agriculture wastewater and sewage effluents often contain significant quantities of heavy metals and other substances that may be toxic to people but beneficial to horticultural crops. However, before sewage effluent can be used for commercial production of vegetables and fruits, research must be undertaken to determine whether there is accumulation of heavy metals and faecal coliforms in the edible portion of the horticultural produce which may be detrimental to human health 15–20 years later. Research must be undertaken to assess the impact of sewage effluent on soil physical, chemical properties and environment after continued use.

N2  - Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is one of the most important horticultural crops in Iran often cultivated in arid and semiarid regions of the country with salinity problems. The objective of this work was to better understand the mechanisms of physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress of five Iranian melon landraces “Samsuri”, “Kashan”, “Khatouni”, “Suski-e-Sabz”, and “Ghobadlu” from different geographical origins, and “Galia” F1 cultivar. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and irrigated with half-strength Hoagland solution containing 0, 30, 60, or 90 mM NaCl for 60 days. Increase in the external salt concentration was accompanied by an obvious depression in leaf relative water content, membrane stability index, chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid contents, stomata and trichome density, leaf area, specific leaf area, biomass, leaf and stem K+ concentrations as well as leaf and stem K+/Na+ ratios in all landraces studied. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, proline and soluble carbohydrate contents, activity of antioxidant enzymes as well as leaf and stem Na+ and Cl− concentrations, all increased significantly with increasing stress over all plants. Moreover, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), determined on leaf organic matter, was found to be associated with evaluated traits. For example, a highly positive correlation between Δ13C and both biomass production and salt tolerance index was notable when all saline treatments were averaged (r = 0.998 and 0.998, respectively). Also, scatter plot and clustering analysis showed that “Suski-e-Sabz” and “Ghobadlu” were placed close to “Galia” F1, a salt tolerant cultivar, indicating that their similar behavior under salinity. Overall, the present results indicated a significant genetic variability for most of the traits studied, suggesting that “Suski-e-Sabz” and “Ghobadlu” could be introduced as the superior landraces and the most promising tolerant parents in the future melon breeding programs due to their suitable performance, in terms of responses to salt stress as compared with other landraces. Also, Δ13C can be used as a powerful criterion in melon breeding programs aimed at selection of salt tolerant landraces.

N2  - The monitoring of river health systems is crucial to maintain the integrity of services derived from them. This study investigated the physicochemical and microbiological levels in some tributaries of the Luvuvhu River water and sediments in South Africa. High levels of cadmium were recorded in the sediments of most of the rivers capable of posing high risk to aquatic organisms. The severity of the other metals ranged from low to medium risk. Comparable results on the effects of trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) on aquatic biota were obtained using various ecological indices (such as contamination factor, degree of contamination and potential ecological risk) and sediment quality guidelines (such as threshold effect level and the probable effect level of the Canadian council of the Environment (CCME) and the effect range-low and effect range-median). High levels of faecal indicator organisms (>59,000 cfu/100 mL) were recorded in all water source that are often used for domestic and agricultural purposes. The decreasing trend of faecal indicator organisms in the selected rivers were in the order: Mvudi > Mudidaba > Dzindi > Luvuvhu > Dzondo. Hence the use of the water for domestic purposes possess a potential acute human health risk. The levels of trace metals obtained from this study were above the threshold levels of water used in aquaculture though most of them complied with the regulatory limit for domestic and irrigation water use in some of the rivers. The decreasing trend of average trace metals levels were in the order: Mvudi > Mudidaba > Dzondo > Luvuvhu > Dzindi. The water quality of some of the tributaries of the Luvuvhu river (Mvudi and Mudidaba) were found to be more contaminated than the Luvuvhu River. Hence, constant monitoring of the various tributaries is recommended, and river restoration programs should be initiated where necessary.

N2  - Targeted selective treatments (TST) are designed to identify those animals that would actually benefit from anthelmintic treatment, thus reducing the amount of drugs used and bringing down economic cost. In this study we assayed three TST programs based on GIN egg output, clinical sign and live weight criteria in a single area where only sub-clinical infections tend to occur and no anthelmintic resistance is reported. The study was carried out from February 2011 to August 2013 on four farms applying different management systems: an Ovine Extensive System, Ovine Semi-extensive Semi-irrigated System focusing on “Rubia del Molar” and Colmenareña” breeds, Ovine Semi-extensive System and Caprine Organic Semi-extensive System. The number of sheep and goats treated in all the TST strategies was lower in comparison with systematic treatments, especially when selected based on clinical signs (100%, in both years), followed by egg output (87.57% and 90.44% in the first and second year respectively) and finally by live weight (37.95% and 96.69%, in the first and second year respectively). FEC was low throughout the study for all animals and groups. Apparently, the TST applied did not influence live body weight. Preliminary results show that all three targeted selective treatments significantly reduced the number of animals treated and the cost of anthelmintic treatment on the farms, maintaining productivity in a low challenge environment. These results also seem to indicate that systematic anthelmintic treatments are unnecessary under these circumstances and traditional anthelmintic regimes should therefore be modified.

N2  - This paper aims at identifying the key determinants, which influence and motivate farmers to adopt a rational, cost-effective, climate-smart adaptation strategy. Macro data encompasses review of studies using “Scopus database” and Micro data from field survey in dry region of Bundelkhand (Uttar Pradesh), India. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted to select study sites and respondents. A total of 200 sample households of various land size categories were contacted for collecting data using a well-structured and pre-tested schedule. Study findings revealed that variability in temperature and rainfall has affected adversely to the livelihoods of farmers. Low level of livelihood status, fewer non-farm employment opportunities and low cropped area under irrigation were the main barriers to climate change adaptation. Insurance and credit were the main positive determinants that motivated farmers to adjust farm practices. Early maturing seed varieties and less water consuming crop varieties were the most profitable adaptation strategies. Policy intervention should prioritize eliminating asymmetry in information and communication. Enhancing institutional capacities to forecast weather in small geographic regions accurately and warranting accountability of meteorological department is imperative.

N2  - Cash transfer programs create multiplier effects when recipients put the money they receive to work to generate further incomes. When this is the case, the ultimate income effects are multiples of the amounts transferred. We analyze the PROCAMPO program in Mexico that was introduced to compensate farmers for the anticipated negative effect of NAFTA on the prices of basic crops. The transfer rules and the timing of the panel data collected allow unique control of biases in this impact analysis. We find that the multiplier among ejido sector recipients is in the range 1.5–2.6. Multipliers are higher for households with medium and large farms, low numbers of adults in the household, nonindigenous backgrounds, and located in the Center and Gulf regions. High multipliers reflect income opportunities that had remained unrealized due to liquidity constraints that are relaxed by the transfers. Opportunities come from the asset endowments that these households received through the land reform, particularly irrigated land, and they are enhanced by access to technical assistance.

N2  - Summary
A combination of driving forces are increasing pressure on local, national, and regional water supplies needed for irrigation, energy production, industrial uses, domestic purposes, and the environment. In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.

N2  - During the second half of the nineteenth century and the first third of the twentieth century, Spain, along with some other European countries, underwent a process of transition regarding water resources management. One of the most obvious transformations that occurred during this period was the increasing lead taken by the government in the building of large hydraulic structures and the subsequent decrease in the influence of private initiative in this matter. The government's aim was to exploit the water resources provided by the rivers to their full, and in particular to use the water that was destined for irrigation to maximum effect. The repeated failure of projects promoted by private companies led the government, not without problems, to enact regulations and create hydraulic plans to be put into motion by the public sector. This change in focus is the key to understanding the frenetic pace of hydraulic infrastructure construction that occurred later and which made Spain one of the world's leading nations in terms of indicators such as the number of large reservoirs in use. This article focuses on the transition from private initiative to public intervention and evaluates the main stages of this process in Spain. The cases of the basins of the Muga and Fluvià rivers, located in the extreme north-east of the Iberian Peninsula in Catalonia, are described in light of this process. This research attempts to verify that despite their modest size and their distance from the main decision-making centres, these two cases reflected the situation at the national level. This was just one of the many local effects of the transition process of water resources management in Spain, even though the results of this transformation would be neither immediate nor effective in the short term.

N2  - Summary
The Colorado River is one of the most important sources of water in the western United States, supplying water to over 35 million people in the U.S. and 3 million people in Mexico. High dissolved-solids loading to the River and tributaries are derived primarily from geologic material deposited in inland seas in the mid-to-late Cretaceous Period, but this loading may be increased by human activities. High dissolved solids in the River causes substantial damages to users, primarily in reduced agricultural crop yields and corrosion. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program was created to manage dissolved-solids loading to the River and has focused primarily on reducing irrigation-related loading from agricultural areas. This work presents a reconnaissance of existing data from sites in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) in order to highlight areas where suspended-sediment control measures may be useful in reducing dissolved-solids concentrations. Multiple linear regression was used on data from 164 sites in the UCRB to develop dissolved-solids models that include combinations of explanatory variables of suspended sediment, flow, and time. Results from the partial t-test, overall likelihood ratio, and partial likelihood ratio on the models were used to group the sites into categories of strong, moderate, weak, and no-evidence of a relation between suspended-sediment and dissolved-solids concentrations. Results show 68 sites have strong or moderate evidence of a relation, with drainage areas for many of these sites composed of a large percentage of clastic sedimentary rocks. These results could assist water managers in the region in directing field-scale evaluation of suspended-sediment control measures to reduce UCRB dissolved-solids loading.

N2  - India has been an agrarian economy since ancient times and the science and art of agriculture, animal husbandry, soil management and irrigation have richly evolved through the course of its history. The present study illustrates the ways in which these were impacted by the colonization of the country, the subsequent Independence in 1947 amid the complex environment of the Cold War and India’s policy of Non-Alignment. Amid a difficult socio-economic situation enraged by the famines and food insecurity in India and the simultaneous Four Point Program of the then President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, there emerged a consensus between the two countries to improve the living standards, eliminate hunger, encourage education in food production, food handling, food utilization and hence development in India with the help of Land-Grant Universities, by creating similar education centers in India. This study of Indo-American partnership in agricultural education, research and extension through the also incorporates a discussion of the extraordinary role of the Ford and Rockefeller foundations as well as that of CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center), IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) and ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics), whose joint efforts with Indian scientists helped build solid foundations for agricultural universities in India, attain self-sufficiency in food grain production and proved to be the harbinger of a new era of Indo-US relations through the Green Revolution.

N2  - A pyritic refractory gold ore was oxidized in short and tall isothermal columns at different temperatures (22, 45 and 65 °C) with consortia of mesophiles, moderate and extreme thermophiles under a variety of experimental conditions. These experiments were performed as part of a heap leach model validation program. Severe air channeling and bed compaction occurred in columns as short as 2 m packed with non-agglomerated ore particles. Similar problems were encountered in columns loaded with 9 mm agglomerates prepared with smaller particles (<3.3 mm). Although aeration was key to maintaining high potentials, neither the irrigation flow rate, nor the inoculation procedure, nor CO2 enrichment had any significant effect on the oxidation kinetics at ambient temperature. Elemental sulfur oxidation was more rapid at elevated temperatures. Reasons why sulfide oxidation kinetics in the 65 °C column were comparable to the 45 °C test, and thus slower than predicted by the intrinsic Arrhenius activation energy of pyrite, are discussed.

N2  - Syracuse, New York is working under a court-ordered agreement to limit combined sewer overflows (CSO) to local surface waters. Green infrastructure technologies, including green roofs, are being implemented as part of a CSO abatement strategy and to develop co-benefits of diminished stormwater runoff, including decreased loading of contaminants to the wastewater system and surface waters. The objective of this study was to examine the quantity and quality of discharge associated with precipitation events over an annual cycle from a green roof in Syracuse, NY and to compare measurements from this monitoring program with results from a roof irrigation experiment. Wet deposition, roof drainage, and water quality were measured for 87 storm events during an approximately 12 month period over 2011–2012. Water and nutrient (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon) mass balances were conducted on an event basis to evaluate retention annually and during the growing and non-growing seasons. These results are compared with a hydrological manipulation experiment, which comprised of artificially watering of the roof. Loadings of nutrients were calculated for experimental and actual storms using the concentration of nutrients and the flow data of water discharging the roof. The green roof was effective in retaining precipitation quantity from storm events (mean percent retention 96.8%, SD = 2.7%, n = 87), although the relative fraction of water retained decreased with increases in the size of the event. There was no difference in water retention of the green roof for the growing and non-growing seasons. Drainage waters exhibited high concentration of nutrients during the warm temperature growing season, particularly total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon. Overall, nutrient losses were low because of the strong retention of water. However, there was marked variation in the retention of nutrients by season due to variations in concentrations in roof runoff.

N2  - Iran experiences insufficient precipitation, resulting in excessive use of groundwater resources, leading to negative water balances in many plains. As a result, the Ministry of Energy began implementing the Groundwater Rehabilitation and Balancing Plan (GRBP) in 2006 to replenish the aquifers. The plan includes measures such as Blocking Illegal Wells (BIW), Equipping Wells with Volumetric Meters (EWVM), Increasing Patrol and Control (IPC), and inspecting the degree of exploitation of groundwater, etc. In this study, researchers examined the level of social agreement between farmers and experts on the effectiveness of the Ministry of Energy's policies for the GRBP and assessed the farmers' response to droughts in this descriptive-analytic study. The data were collected using questionnaires designed in Likert scale, and they were analyzed in R programming language using the t-test, independent-sample t-test, and Friedman test. It was found that 84% and 58% of the farmers have negative attitudes towards BIW and IPC respectively. Farmers have demonstrated the greatest level of cooperation (90%), towards the use of pressured irrigation system (IPIS). The study revealed that farmers and experts disagree about the effectiveness of all measures in reviving and balancing groundwater resources. Farmers are not willing to cooperate with the government on the implementation of measures that limit their agricultural freedom. According to Friedman's results, unlike farmers, experts prefer structural and procedural measures, such as blocking unauthorized wells, instead of relying on educational methods and culturalization. This study demonstrates how understating and discrediting farmers' roles in sustainable water resources and constructing a monocentric governance system has led to the current situation, which is not ideal for groundwater sustainability.

N2  - Climatic variability and land surface change have a wide range of effects on streamflow and are often difficult to separate. We analyzed long-term records of climate, land use and land cover, and re-constructed the water budget based on precipitation, groundwater levels, and water use from 1950 through 2010 in the Cimarron–Skeleton watershed and a portion of the Cimarron–Eagle Chief watershed in Oklahoma, an irrigation-intensive agricultural watershed in the Southern Great Plains, USA. Our results show that intensive irrigation through alluvial aquifer withdrawal modifies climatic feedback and alters streamflow response to precipitation. Increase in consumptive water use was associated with decreases in annual streamflow, while returning croplands to non-irrigated grasslands was associated with increases in streamflow. Along with groundwater withdrawal, anthropogenic-induced factors and activities contributed nearly half to the observed variability of annual streamflow. Streamflow was more responsive to precipitation during the period of intensive irrigation between 1965 and 1984 than the period of relatively lower water use between 1985 and 2010. The Cimarron River is transitioning from a historically flashy river to one that is more stable with a lower frequency of both high and low flow pulses, a higher baseflow, and an increased median flow due in part to the return of cropland to grassland. These results demonstrated the interrelationship among climate, land use, groundwater withdrawal and streamflow regime and the potential to design agricultural production systems and adjust irrigation to mitigate impact of increasing climate variability on streamflow in irrigation intensive agricultural watershed.

N1  - Water Resources Assessment for catchment management
N2  - This work describes the development, operational functionalities and spatial modeling applications of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based irrigation management system, to be used by irrigation consortia and local governmental institutions. The system provides tools for the exploration of spatially-referenced databases relevant for irrigation and the evaluation of irrigation scenarios under different soil, climatic and management conditions. The irrigation water management system makes use of ArcView GIS and the Avenue programming language for customization of GIS applications and design of new tools for modeling irrigation water requirements and identifying of areas with water deficit. Irrigation requirements can be estimated taking into account different scenarios of cropping pattern, climatic conditions (from dry to wet year), applied irrigation method, volume of water available for irrigation and hydraulic characteristics of the water distribution system. The irrigation water management system runs on different scales of both irrigation (from irrigation field to irrigation consortia) and administrative (from municipality to region) units. The integration of spatial climatic and soil data is based on the “false-raster” format, a vector layer composed of regular square grid cells. The size of simulation units is a function of the surface area under consideration which means that the exploration of GIS database and development of irrigation scenarios provide more detailed data at field and municipality scale and less number of information at consortia and regional scales. An example of operational functionality of the GIS-based irrigation water management system is given for the Apulia region, in Southern Italy.

N2  - Given the increasing tension between food production and food demand in
sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the poor development of the rice sector
in Africa, the present paper examines the impact of agricultural
extension on adoption of chemical fertilizers and their impact on rice
productivity in Ghana. A parametric approach was employed to account for
selectivity and endogeneity effects, which most impact studies fail to
address. The empirical results reveal that agricultural extension
service is endogenous in the chemical fertilizer adoption specification.
Our findings show that access to extension services significantly
promotes adoption of chemical fertilizer. Access to extension services
and adoption of chemical fertilizer exert positive influences on rice
productivity. Promoting farmer participation in irrigation schemes and
row-planting technologies, facilitating easy access to education and
credit facilities, sensitization of female farmers and leasing of
farmlands are policy alternatives needed to facilitate adoption of
chemical fertilizer and access to extension services, with the goal of
enhancing rice productivity and the livelihoods of rice farmers in
sub-Saharan Africa. Governments and various institutions in Africa
should train more extension officers, given the significant impact they
have on agricultural technology adoption and productivity. Future
studies on adoption of agricultural technologies and access to extension
services in developing countries should adopt empirical approaches that
account for endogeneity and selectivity effect in order to arrive at the
precise magnitude and extent of impacts from productive agricultural
technologies and interventions. (C) 2016 Royal Netherlands Society for

N2  - The Region of Murcia (south-east Spain) is a world-leading agricultural producer which exports 2.5 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables per year. It holds a leading position in international sales of many fresh products including lettuce, broccoli, lemon, melon and artichoke. However, the sustainability of this highly profitable business is in the spotlight as concerns mount regarding environmental exhaustion caused by intensive farming. To gain a more objective perspective, we present the first quantification of the environmental impacts of the fruit and vegetable production systems in this region using a “cradle-to-gate” life cycle assessment. We provide standard measurable values of resource depletion; acidification and eutrophication hazards; global warming potential; and use of water resources. Once the crops and agricultural stages in critical need of intervention are identified, we propose and evaluate mitigation strategies to curb their impact. Our results show that in general woody crops have bigger footprints than vegetable crops, as they usually demand higher amounts of energy, pesticides, fertilisers and water, for considerably lower yields. Nonetheless, a turnabout in the carbon footprint was observed when CO2 fixation, which is commonly not included in Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), was accounted for. This is due to the fact that woody crops, despite having higher emissions, are more efficient carbon sinks. When analysing impacts per agricultural stage, our results add more weight to the growing body of LCA-based evidence that irrigation, field work operations and fertiliser production have the most detrimental impacts. The most promising impact-mitigation action was the replacement of mineral fertiliser with manure, which offered potential footprint reductions of up to 10% and 21% for vegetable and woody crops, respectively. For woody crops, moderate impact reductions (up to 6% without a decline in yield) can also be achieved with deficit irrigation, which can be applied in synergy with mulching or organic fertilising. Finally, we compared our results against previous studies and highlighted comparability limitations, such as the inter-annual productivity fluctuations and the wide variability in agricultural practices.

N2  - Water scarcity is a serious issue facing our planet right along -side with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts associated with the use of water by the oil palm trees and the industry for the production of crude palm oil in Malaysia; evaluate the uncertainties of the outcome of a study based on pathway assumptions and the choice of allocation. A full life cycle assessment and a stand-alone water footprint value based on the local water stress index has been determined. The system boundary included the oil palm nursery, plantation (with land use change of oil palm to oil palm and from logged over forest) and palm oil mill (biogas capture scenario). The results showed that the direct water used by the crops and process was minimal because the oil palm plantations in Malaysia were firstly rain fed and not irrigated and secondly Malaysia is located in a region with high availability of renewable water resulting to a low water stress index. The water footprint concluded that the main potential impacts within the system boundary were dominated by land conversion, production and use of fertilisers and pesticides. These findings contradict the general perception of any agriculture system where the notion to assume that the water used by the crop will have the major potential impact. The findings also highlighted the importance of the choice of pathway, government initiatives and managerial intervention for biogas capture which resulted to a 117% reduction in the water footprint. Economic allocation had a 21% increase in the water footprint as compared to weight allocation. It was recommended that plantations implement Good Agricultural Practices that addresses the key elements of land, water management, fertiliser and integrated pest management and the choice of pathways and allocation procedures are made transparent with the results as outcomes may differ as shown in this paper.

N2  - Knowledge of irrigation is essential for ensuring food and water security, and to cope with the scarcity of water resources, which is expected to exacerbate under the pressure of climate change and population increase. Even though irrigation is likely the most important direct human intervention in the hydrological cycle, we have only partial knowledge on the areas of our planet in which irrigation takes place, and almost no information on the amount of water that is applied for irrigation. In this study, we developed a new approach exploiting satellite soil moisture observations for quantifying the amount of water applied for irrigation. Through the inversion of the soil water balance equation, and by using satellite soil moisture products as input, the amount of water entering into the soil, and hence irrigation, is determined. Through synthetic experiments, we first assessed the impact of soil moisture measurement uncertainty and temporal resolution, also as a function of climate, on the accuracy of the method. Second, we applied the proposed approach to currently available coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2). Nine pilot sites in Europe, USA, Australia and Africa were used as case study to test the method in a real-world application. The synthetic experiment showed that the method is able to quantify irrigation, with satisfactory performance from satellite data with retrieval errors lower than ∼0.04 m³/m³ and revisit times shorter than 3 days. In the case studies based on real satellite data, qualitative assessments (due to missing in situ irrigation observations) showed that over regions in which satellite soil moisture products perform well, and which are characterized by prolonged periods without rainfall, the method shows good results in quantifying irrigation. However, at sites in which rainfall is sustained throughout the year, the proposed method fails in obtaining reliable performances. Similarly, low performances are obtained in areas where satellite products uncertainties are too large, or their spatial resolution is too coarse with respect to the size of the irrigated fields.

N2  - A multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to simulate the establishment of water markets is developed. The environment is an irrigated area governed by a non-profit agency, which is responsible for water production, allocation, and pricing. There is a traditional situation of historical rights, average-cost pricing for water allocation, large quantities of water used, and inefficiency. A market-oriented policy could be implemented by accounting for ecological and political objectives such as saving groundwater and safeguarding historical rights while promoting economic efficiency. In this paper, a problem is solved by compromise programming, a multi-criteria technique based on the principles of Simonian logic. The model is theoretically developed and applied to the Lorca region in Spain near the Mediterranean Sea.

N2  - The 2003 CAP reform considerably affects cropping patterns in European
agriculture. At the same time the imperatives of the Water Framework
Directive (WFD) are expected to modify irrigation decisions especially
in Southern Europe where irrigated agriculture utilizes about 70-80% of
total water. The paper uses a nonlinear optimization model that
incorporates rain-fed, irrigated and fodder crops to examine the impacts
of water pricing and CAP reform on cropping patterns, water use,
irrigation technology use and farm returns in the region of Thessaly,
Greece. The results indicate that, although there are important
trade-offs between water pricing (WFD) and decoupling (CAP reform),
water use is more sensitive to water pricing in the post-reform CAP. (c)

N2  - Summary
Rise in groundwater level followed by waterlogging and secondary salinisation has become a serious problem in canal irrigated areas located in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. To solve the problem, the groundwater model SGMP was applied in a waterlogged area of Haryana State of India in which about 500,000ha has already waterlogged resulting in reduced crop yield and abandonment of agricultural lands. After successful calibration and validation, several scenario building exercises have been conducted. Error and sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were done. The impact of potential policy changes on the groundwater levels has been analysed through the model. The alternative scenarios revealed that small increase in the net recharge would cause the waterlogging problem to aggravate. On the other hand, if net recharge decreases, the situation would turn favorable. The study also revealed that by reducing the recharge in the range of 5–20% from the average values, the watertable could be stabilized at a safe depth. To prevent the area from further salinisation some recommendations can be given such as; increase in groundwater abstraction, water distribution as per water requirements of crops, and the lining of surface irrigation systems. Thus it is apparent that the SGMP model seems to be an effective tool for groundwater simulation. It has the potential of assessing the watertable behaviour due to various interventions. The results of simulation studies of existing and proposed water management policy, therefore, may form the basis for the identification of appropriate water management plans for the future.

N2  - Since Ethiopia is going through a rapid transformation of its agricultural sector, we assessed the human health and environmental risks due to the past use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as the risks of the current pesticide use by farmers. A monitoring programme and risk assessment was carried out for the Wedecha-Belbela irrigation system in the Debra Zeit area. The Wedecha and Belbela rivers and adjacent temporary ponds were sampled and examined for the presence of OCPs between August and October 2014, while data on the current pesticide use by small- and large-scale farmers was collected by interviews. The usage patterns were evaluated for risks of using the river or temporary ponds as source of drinking water and for risks for the aquatic ecosystems in the river and ponds with the aid of the PRIMET_Registration_Ethiopa_1.1 model. The samples were collected in five sampling periods, and results indicate that most of the 18 target OCPs were not detected above the detection limit, while g-chlordane may pose chronic risks when surface water is used as drinking water. Endosulfan and heptachlor pose risks to aquatic organisms at second-tier level, while for heptachlor-epoxide B, g-chlordane and b-BHC only risks could be determined at the first tier due to a lack of data. For all nine pesticides used by small-scale farmers the calculated acute risks to humans were low. Second tier risk assessment for the aquatic ecosystem indicated that lambda-cyhalothrin, endosulfan, profenofos, and diazinon may pose high risks.

N2  - Background
“Food insecurity is a major problem in Ethiopia due to frequent droughts in a country where farmers depend on rain fed agriculture”. It is affecting the population that usually experiences food shortage even at the optimal conditions of weather and market in the area. Agro-pastoral areas are characterized by frequent calamities, and lack of adequate infrastructure, social services and institutions in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the food security status and determinants of the agro-pastoral community in north-eastern rift valley of Ethiopia. A total of 337 households were selected using simple random sampling techniques. Various descriptive techniques were used to analyze the data. The Foster–Greer–Thorbecke model was employed to estimate the food security indices and the headcount ratio.
Results
The finding revealed that, about 64% of the sampled households were found to be food insecure. Based on the logit regression model; age, marital status and family size were negatively affected the household food security. Whereas, irrigation land use, livestock ownership and access to credit were affected positively.
Conclusion
Thus, it can be concluded that equally promoting male and female agro-pastoral communities in food and nutrition security should be a public issue for accessing sustainable food. Fundamentally, the finding is focused on the need for coordinated policy actions including family planning, providing household credit services, crop insurance and using total livestock units, technology adoption and supporting income diversification. Therefore, future intervention plans should focus on capacity building through enhancing their access to human, financial and physical capital.

N2  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major hydrologic flux in water resources planning and irrigation management. While recent advances in remote sensing (RS) have enabled availability of high spatial and temporal resolution ET data, a lack of information related to error in the estimations has made it challenging to use this data for on-farm irrigation management decision making. In this study, three commonly used single-source RS based ET models (pySEBAL — a new version of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land; SEBS — Surface Energy Balance System algorithm; and METRIC — Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) were used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for almonds, processing tomatoes, and maize in the Central Valley of California. Model evaluation was conducted by comparing the predicted ETa from RS with in-situ measured ETa using surface renewal. Results indicated that the RS-based ETa estimations for all three models were within acceptable levels of uncertainty and agreed well with surface renewal estimates except for the underestimation by pySEBAL and METRIC during early season growth stages of processing tomatoes. This underestimation was attributed to the lack of accuracy when using single source ET models under lower vegetation cover condition (when ET is dominated by soil evaporation). Better estimates of ETa with pySEBAL and METRIC were detected at full cover, which explains the applicability of these two models to irrigation management during peak crop water demand. SEBS performed the best among the three RS-based models for daily ETa estimation for all crops. This suggests that SEBS-based ETa estimates can be adopted in operational irrigation management programs for farms that have not installed in field ETa sensors such as Tule Sensors (Tule Technologies Inc.). In addition, RS based ET is spatially distributed which can help to identity spatial variability between different irrigation zones.

N2  - Land degradation affects natural and cultivated socio-ecosystems worldwide. Soil erosion is one of the main processes leading to land degradation, and the process is accelerated by human actions. Spain is dealing with extensive land degradation caused by land use and land cover change (LULCC), for instance by land abandonment, and local geo-ecological conditions. Recent land abandonment in Spain can be largely related to changing policies and international market development, which have resulted in the reallocation of agriculture and a shift from traditional rainfed crops to intensification of irrigated agriculture. This radical change in LULCC by land abandonment resulted in two opposite trends, towards greening-up and towards land degradation, each with enormous consequences for the environment by its effects on soil hydrology, runoff, sediment sources, soil erosion, fluvial channel adjustments and forest fire risks. To mitigate negative effects, appropriate management and conservation strategies are necessary. In this review, we analyze the top-down policy framework of soil conservation in Spain, with a specific focus on the Region of Murcia. We found that multiple international policies, i.e. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the European Water Framework Directive and the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), contribute to soil and water conservation at the national level, where the national administration selects most appropriate measures according to the country's current state. These measures are incorporated in national policies, such as the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification and the National Rural Development Programme. In case of the CAP, agro-environmental subsidies are an instrument to promote soil protection at a national level. Regionally adjusted sub-measures, based on regional environmental characteristics, are then integrated in the Regional Rural Development Programmes of the Spanish Autonomous Communities. The application of subsidies, related to soil protection, is found to be controversial, as studies do not agree upon its effect on soil erosion and land degradation control. To improve decision-making, concepts such as the ecosystem service approach and nature-based solutions are suggested to be included in future policies, as these concepts aim to improve the status of the entire ecosystem in a more holistic manner than is currently the case.

N2  - The stiff competition for water between agriculture and non-agricultural production sectors makes it necessary to have effective management of irrigation networks in farms. However, the process of selecting flow control structures in irrigation networks is highly complex and involves different levels of decision makers. In this paper, we apply multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodology to develop a decision analysis (DA) framework for evaluating, ranking and selecting check and intake structures for irrigation canals. The DA framework consists of identifying relevant attributes for canal structures, developing a robust scoring system for alternatives, identifying a procedure for data quality control, and identifying a MADM model for the decision analysis. An application is illustrated through an analysis for automation purposes of the Qazvin irrigation network, one of the oldest and most complex irrigation networks in Iran. A survey questionnaire designed based on the decision framework was distributed to experts, managers, and operators of the Qazvin network and to experts from the Ministry of Power in Iran. Five check structures and four intake structures were evaluated. A decision matrix was generated from the average scores collected from the survey, and was subsequently solved using TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. To identify the most critical structure attributes for the selection process, optimal attribute weights were calculated using Entropy method. For check structures, results show that the duckbill weir is the preferred structure while the pivot weir is the least preferred. Use of the duckbill weir can potentially address the problem with existing Amil gates where manual intervention is required to regulate water levels during periods of flow extremes. For intake structures, the Neyrpic® gate and constant head orifice are the most and least preferred alternatives, respectively. Some advantages of the Neyrpic® gate are ease of operation and capacity to measure discharge flows. Overall, the application to the Qazvin irrigation network demonstrates the utility of the proposed DA framework in selecting appropriate structures for regulating water flows in irrigation canals. This framework systematically aids the decision process by capturing decisions made at various levels (individual farmers to high-level management). It can be applied to other cases where a new irrigation network is being designed, or where changes in irrigation structures need to be identified to improve flow control in existing networks.

N2  - Increasing productivity of the rice-wheat system (RW) in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) is a major challenge in the context of the various economic (increasing cost of labour, irrigation water, and energy) and bio-physical (water scarcity, depletion of soil fertility, and climatic variability) constraints. We evaluated the performance of three RW system intensification options with different management interventions over two years, comparing a conventional RW rotation (CS1), with two stages of conservation agriculture (CA) interventions, (i) the simple inclusion of mungbean (CS2), and (ii) the inclusion of mungbean together with full CA implementation (CS3) at two sites in the EGP that differed with respect to soil type, water table dynamics, and agro-climatic conditions. Our evaluation focussed on improving system productivity and resource use efficiency. The addition of mungbean into the conventional RW rotation produced significantly higher system productivity (rice equivalent yield, REY) compared with the existing double-crop rotation across sites. The baseline system was enhanced further when CA-based management practices were adopted, however, the magnitude of system benefit from CA was site and situation-specific. At the fine-textured soil site, gains were observed in system production (by 5.4 %), irrigation water productivity (WPI, by 40 %), and N use efficiency (NUE, by 5%) for the CA-based intensified system (CS3) in comparison with the CT-based intensified system (CS2). The average wheat yield and WPI in the zero-till (ZT) system (CS3) was always higher than in the conventional (CT) systems (CS1 and CS2), mainly due to enhanced wheat rooting after unpuddled rice across the sites. At the fine-textured soil site, the cessation of puddling in rice cropping maintained rice grain yield, while increasing WPI. However, in the coarse-textured soil site, the cessation of puddling resulted in lower rice grain production (by 14 %), coupled with much higher (1.3 times) irrigation water requirement than the conventional puddled rice systems (CS1 and CS2) in the second year due to increased percolation rate, which negatively impacted the overall performance of the CA-based system (CS3). Therefore, the modification of the traditional CT-based system to an intensified CA-based approach can improve the productivity of the RW system in terms of yield of the component crops as well as better NUE and WPI in fine-textured soil, while the feasibility of the full CA system in coarse-textured soil seems limited due to poor performance of rice, and requires further research focusing on the best rice establishment option.

N2  - This paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation in community-managed water user associations, in a context where assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these institutions existed before training began. We also examine whether participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm operations to other workers, in a context where only managers have been directly trained, almost all managers are male, and females are increasingly operating farms. We collected microdata from 1855 farms in Southern Tajikistan, where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received longer training, while those in the other 40 received shorter training. These â€˜treatmentâ€™ and â€˜controlâ€™ subdistricts were selected by constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to training duration. Farms were then selected from a census using a stratified random sampling process. A difference-in-difference technique with right-hand-side covariates is employed, where both sets of data were collected after training was completed. This choice of econometric methods controls against farm-level selection effects, but introduces a potential bias due to measurement error. Longer training has a causal effect on increasing participation in WUAs. Results also demonstrate that when male workers not directly trained operate farms, participation is not affected; however, participation is negatively affected when female workers operate farms. These results provide evidence for designing irrigation management programs to target female workers directly, in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on active farm participation.

N2  - Much of North China, including the Beijing municipality, is impacted by high levels of water scarcity. As a countermeasure, since the 1990s, Beijing and Hebei Provinces have jointly initiated a series of ecological engineering programs that have the potential to be replicated throughout the region. This study reports on an evaluation of one such program - the Paddy Land-to-Dry Land (PLDL) program - that operated between 2006 and 2015 and involved an incentive payment to farmers to cultivate spring maize instead of paddy rice. The evaluation included a range of water consumption and water degradation indicators based on water footprint and life cycle assessment methodologies. The program was found to be a success in reducing irrigation water demand in each of the three counties where it was implemented: Chicheng, Fengning and Luanping. However, assessment by various indicators, such as the grey water footprint, freshwater eutrophication potential and freshwater ecosystem quality, indicated potential increased risks to water quality, largely related to the higher applications of fertilizer associated with maize cropping. This study demonstrates the importance of using a broad range of indicators when evaluating an ecological engineering project, as well as the potential for such programs to have unintended negative impacts.

N2  - The combination of zero tillage (ZT) and crop residue retention can substantially improve soil structure and reduce the risk of erosion. Growing conditions for crops are substantially altered in such systems and the question whether specific varieties adapted to ZT conditions need to be developed is not answered. Most published research assessed Genotype by Tillage interactions, which are rarely significant, using genotypes generally developed under CT conditions. CIMMYT’s durum wheat breeding program went beyond this approach and performed parallel early generation selection within 16 crosses both in conventional tilled (CT) and ZT soils with the aim of comparing the effect of selection environment (either CT or ZT) on the performance of selected progenies. From 16 initial crosses, 234 lines were selected under CT and 250 under ZT. All 484 lines were subsequently tested for yield and growth traits during three seasons near Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico in three different testing environments. Those included ZT and CT with full irrigation and CT with reduced irrigation. Early vegetative growth was slightly improved with selection under ZT in all testing environments. Grain yield was highest in ZT testing environment, with a very small average difference in 2013 (0.11 t ha-1) and larger differences in 2014 (0.65 t ha-1) and 2015 (0.42 t ha-1). The differences between selection streams observed for yield were marginal and in most cases not significant. We conclude that, within the germplasm pool handled in CIMMYT’s durum wheat breeding program, selection can be conducted under either tillage conditions without affecting negatively the performance of resulting progenies. The neutrality of selection under ZT in relation to performance of progenies is a likely hypothesis that should be tested in other ZT conditions and germplasm pool combinations.

N2  - Rice productivity in Eastern Indo-Gangetic plains (EIGP) is extremely low, in part due to the prevailing practice of cultivating long-duration transplanted rice under rainfed conditions which leads to water stress and significant yield losses in many seasons. Rice establishment alternatives such as direct seeded rice (DSR) require less water at planting but also are accompanied by climate risks that constrain adoption. For both conventional transplanted and DSR systems, successfully addressing climate-based production risks may provide a strong basis for sustainable rice intensification in EIGP. In this ex ante study of rice yield and yield variability, the APSIM cropping system model was used to evaluate the efficacy of risk-reducing management practices in both transplanted and DSR systems. Simulations were conducted with 44 years (1970–2013) of historical weather data from central Bihar, India. Results confirm that the prevailing farmer practice of transplanting long-duration cultivars under rainfed conditions (fTR) often results in delayed transplanting and the use of older seedlings, leading to low (median 1.6 t ha−1) and variable (Standard deviation (SD) 2.1 t ha−1) rice yields. To improve the fTR system, simulations suggest that adoption of medium-duration hybrid rice (3.2 t ha−1), provision of supplemental post-establishment irrigation (3.2 t ha−1), or transplanting appropriately aged seedlings (3.4 t ha −1) can double yields as single interventions while, in the case of supplemental irrigation, significantly reducing inter-annual production variability. Additional gains are achievable when interventions are layered: supplemental irrigation paired with medium-duration hybrids increased median rice yields to 4.6 t ha−1 with much lower variability (SD 1.0 t ha−1). In these improved systems where irrigation is used to transplant the crop, simulations revealed the importance of timely planting: high and stable yields are achievable for long-duration cultivars when transplanting is completed by 2 August with this window of opportunity extending to 16 August for medium-duration hybrids. In rainfed DSR systems, the potential pay-offs from single interventions were even higher with medium-duration hybrids resulting in a median yield of 4.5 t ha-1 against 1.8 t ha−1 with long-duration cultivars. For irrigated DSR systems, an optimum sowing window of early to mid-June was identified which resulted in higher and more stable yields with lower water requirements. Simulation results suggest several risk-reducing intensification pathways that can be selectively matched to farmer risk preferences and investment capabilities within the target region in EIGP.

N2  - The coordinated use of surface- and ground-water over time and space as two components of a single irrigation system is of outmost importance in many rural areas of the world, in order to assure crop production sustainability, to restore ongoing and to prevent future issues related to freshwater quality and quantity mismanagement/deterioration. New technological solutions, such as GIS-integrated simulation models, may provide reliable tools in order to evaluate impacts in space and time and to properly manage conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and water-constrained agricultural production. After presenting the common open source simulation programs for dealing with conjunctive use, we discuss and present the integration of the Farm Process (FMP; embedded in the USGS’s MODFLOW One-Water Hydrologic Model) coupled to a Crop Growth Module (CGM) within the open source and public domain QGIS-integrated FREEWAT platform. Using FMP in FREEWAT gains the benefit of the spatial environment and data management tools of a GIS solution, and to perform proper analysis of dynamically integrated terms of the hydrological cycle, to effectively balance crop water demand and supply from different sources of water. A simple hypothetic, yet realistic, application of the proposed approach with FMP and CGM is presented, simulating the yield of irrigated sunflower at harvest in a Mediterranean area. Results provide an insight on the potential exploitation of the developed solution, including, but not limited, to: quantitative temporal analysis of irrigation water sources, detailed analysis of evaporation and transpiration terms (from irrigation, groundwater or rainfall). The coupling of FMP with CGM to estimate crop yield at harvest provides further management tools when dealing with crop productivity. In the simulated case study, the analysis of the water balance terms allowed identifying the relevance of the groundwater contribution to ETc-act, highlighting the role of natural root uptake. The proposed solution is thought to be deployed by water authorities, large farms and public/private companies managing irrigation areas. The use of these tools calls for dedicated capacity building to boost digitalization in the agricultural water sector in order to achieve data-based agricultural water management.

N2  - In this study, the CERES-Maize crop model was used in conjunction with Apollo, a shell program, to evaluate potential improved yield in a central Iowa cornfield on a spatially and temporally variable basis. Five years of historical yield and weather data were used to calibrate the model over 100 spatially variable grid cells for non-irrigated conditions in the 20.25ha field. This calibrated model then used 28 years of historical weather data to simulate three irrigation scenarios: no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation, and precision irrigation. Irrigation improved yield by at least 500kgha−1 in half of the years simulated. Precision irrigation showed slightly lower yields than scheduled uniform irrigation. Assuming use of a center pivot system, irrigation showed economic returns in only one of the 28 years included in the study. High capital costs were the leading restrictor of economic feasibility.

N2  - Climate models predict large climatic variability and more frequent, prolonged droughts in northern China. Still, few studies have examined the seasonal and interannual variation in water use efficiency (WUE) in northern China’s young plantations predisposed to drought. Here, variation in WUE was examined in a young plantation in Beijing over a 6-year period (2012–2017) at several timescales. The study was conducted by examining eddy-covariance measurements of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the multi-year mean WUE for this young plantation was 1.71 ± 0.22 g C per kg H2O. Drought reduced WUE in summer, but increased it in autumn, with no apparent effect in spring. Long-term droughts usually had a greater effect on the annual GEP, ET and WUE than short-term droughts. Intense drought was observed to have a long-term legacy effect on ecosystem GEP, ET and WUE of about 3 years. Monthly WUE had a strong positive linear relationship with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil volumetric water content (VWC) during the growing season. Seasonal variation in WUE was mainly regulated by the biophysical factors controlling GEP. In contrast, interannual variation in WUE was controlled to a greater extent by vegetation cover (i.e., NDVI), which in turn responded to variation in VWC. These results clearly show the importance of timing and duration of drought in controlling ecosystem WUE. Collectively, WUE was more strongly affected by factors affecting carbon uptake than water consumption. Our findings suggest that future drought, when coupled with increased climate variability, irrigation-support planning and selection of appropriate tree species should be central to afforestation programs in northern China.

N2  - Summary
In the developing world’s irrigated areas, water management and planning is often motivated by the need for lasting food security. Two important policy measures to address this need are improving the flexibility of water appropriation rules and developing irrigation storage infrastructure. Little research to date has investigated the performance of these two policy measures in a single analysis while maintaining a basin wide water balance. This paper examines impacts of storage capacity and water appropriation rules on total economic welfare in irrigated agriculture, while maintaining a water balance. The application is to a river basin in northern Afghanistan. A constrained optimization framework is developed to examine economic consequences on food security and farm income resulting from each policy measure. Results show that significant improvements in both policy aims can be achieved through expanding existing storage capacity to capture up to 150 percent of long-term average annual water supplies when added capacity is combined with either a proportional sharing of water shortages or unrestricted water trading. An important contribution of the paper is to show how the benefits of storage and a changed water appropriation system operate under a variable climate. Results show that the hardship of droughts can be substantially lessened, with the largest rewards taking place in the most difficult periods. Findings provide a comprehensive framework for addressing future water scarcity, rural livelihoods, and food security in the developing world’s irrigated regions.

N2  - Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) is an aromatic medicinal herb with beneficial essential oil being used in antibacterial activities and industry of creams, lotions, and perfumes. Use of functional markers expedites breeding cumin for drought tolerance. The objective of this study was to identify association of plant height and several seed yield- related traits with complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) markers in 15 cumin (Cuminum cyminum) accessions under normal irrigation (NI) and drought stress (DS) conditions. Cumin accessions were grown in the field and subjected to NI practice and post-heading DS in two years in Kerman, Iran. The mean seed yield ranged between 448.72 and 994.18 kg/ha in NI and was from 211.05 to 452.05.06 kg/ha in DS. Reduction in plant height and seed yield-related traits ranged 27–28% in the first and 29–50% in the second year in DS compared with NI. Twelve EcoR I-Mse I primer combinations were used to amplify AFLP markers in cDNA fragments isolated from RNA samples. The identified markers were subjected to analysis of marker-trait associations (MTAs) using the generalized linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM). A number of 239 and 208 reliable transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were amplified in cumin genotypes tested in NI and DS, respectively. Of the identified TDFs, highly significant markers were used for association analysis, only. Higher number of MTAs was identified for traits in NI compared with DS. Of the identified linked markers, 5 in NI and 3 in DS were significantly associated with more than one trait under two water status conditions. None of markers were identified as common MTAs between the two moisture conditions. Analysis of population structure demonstrated cumin accessions could be divided into 3 and 4 sub-populations. Overall, high variation was identified in cumin with respect to biological yield, seed yield and seed related traits and the identified linked markers can be incorporated into marker-assisted selection programs for the improvement of seed yield in drought condition.

N2  - Water research studies in Saudi Arabia clearly showed sever depletion of groundwater. Therefore, the scientifically applied research program related to water saving and conservation in agriculture is essential, where agricultural activities account for more than 85% of the total water consumed. This study aims to investigate the effect of four irrigation levels, two irrigation methods and three clay deposits on water-use efficiency (WUE) of squash and the distributions of salts and roots in sandy calcareous soils. A field experiment was conducted at the college experimental station in 2002 and 2003. It consists of three clay deposits, three rates (CO=0, C2=1.0 and C3=2.0%), four irrigation levels (T1=60, T2=80, T3=100 and T4=120% of Eto) using surface (IM1) and subsurface (IM2) drip irrigation. Results indicated that squash fruit yield was significantly increased with the increase in irrigation water level for each season. Generally, WUE values were increased as linearly with applied irrigation water and decreased at the highest irrigation level. Types of clay deposits significantly affected fruit yields compared with the control. The yield increase was 12.8, 8.35 and 6.4% for Khulays, Dhruma and Rawdat clay deposits, respectively. The differences between surface and subsurface drip on fruit yields and WUE were also significant. Results indicated that moisture content of subsurface-treated layer increased dramatically, while salts were accumulated at the surface and away from the emitters in subsurface drip irrigation. Intensive root proliferation is observed in the clay-amended subsurface layer compared with non-amended soil. The advantages of subsurface drip irrigation were related to the relative decrease in salt accumulation in the root zone area where the plant roots were active and water content was relatively higher.

N2  - Reintroduction or re-enforcement programmes are major tools in species conservation, but there is a need for more studies that assess the influence of different husbandry and release methods on the survival of released animals. We investigated the survival of globally threatened Marbled Teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) taken into captivity as ducklings when they became trapped in an irrigation channel, then released again after fledging. We used wing tags and mark–recapture models to estimate the survival of released teal. Ducklings rescued in 1996 (n=53) were released soon after fledging in September and their survival was modelled for seven months until April 1997. Their apparent monthly survival rate (lower than true survival owing to loss of wing tags) was 0.85±0.12 (±s.e.). Ducklings rescued in 1997 (n=44) were released together in February 1998 over five months after fledging, and their survival was modelled for six months from February until August. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0.54±0.06. Ducklings rescued in 1998 (n=159) were released in August–September soon after fledging and their survival was modelled for 10 months from August until June. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0.83±0.07. Monthly survival was significantly higher for the 1996 and 1998 cohort, suggesting that retaining birds in captivity after fledging had a negative impact on post-release survival. When birds were released in February, a lower proportion survived until the breeding season three months later than when they were released five months earlier in September.

N1  - 11th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWP-SA Symposium: IWRM for National and Regional Integration through Science, Policy and Practice
N2  - One of the keys to environmental management is to understand the impact and interaction of people with natural resources as a means to improve human welfare and the consequent environmental sustainability for future generations. In terms of water management one of the on-going challenges is to assess what impact interventions in agriculture, and in particularly different irrigation strategies, will have on livelihoods and water resources in the landscape. Whilst global and national policy provide the overall vision of desired outcomes for environmental management, agricultural development and water use strategies they are often presented with local challenges to embed these policies in the reality on the ground, with different stakeholder groups. The concept that government agencies, advocacy organizations, and private citizens should work together to identify mutually acceptable solutions to environmental and water resource issues is increasing in prominence. Participatory spatial engagement techniques linked to geographic information systems (commonly termed participatory GIS (PGIS)) offers one solution to facilitate such stakeholder dialogues in an efficient and consultative manner. In the context of agricultural water management multi-scale PGIS techniques have recently been piloted as part of the ‘Agricultural Water Management Solutions’ project to investigate the current use and dependencies of water by small-holder farmers a watershed in Tanzania. The piloted approach then developed PGIS scenarios describing the effects on livelihoods and water resources in the watershed when introducing different management technologies. These relatively rapid PGIS multi-scale methods show promise for assessing current and possible future agriculture water management technologies in terms of their bio-physical and socio-economic impacts at the watershed scale. The paper discusses the development of the methodology in the context of improved water management decision making.

N1  - Integrated Water Resources Management - From Concept to Practice
N2  - Currently, Sub-Sahara is experiencing increased frequency of disasters either as floods or droughts which depletes the scarce resources available to sustain increasing populations. Success in preventing food shortages in the African continent can only be achieved by understanding the vulnerability and risk of the majority of smallholder farmers under rainfed and supplementary irrigation coupled with appropriate interventions. Increased frequency of floods, droughts and dry spells pose an increasing threat to the smallholder farmers’ food security and water resources availability in B72A quaternary catchment of the Olifants river basin in South Africa. This paper links maize crop yield risk and smallholder farmer vulnerability arising from droughts by applying a set of interdisciplinary indicators (physical and socio-economic) encompassing gender and institutional vulnerabilities. For the study area, the return period of droughts and dry spells was 2 years. The growing season for maize crop was 121 days on average. Soil water deficit during critical growth stages may reduce potential yields by up to 62%, depending on the length and severity of the moisture deficit. To minimize grain yield loss and avoid total crop failures from intra-seasonal dry spells, farmers applied supplementary irrigation either from river water or rainwater harvested into small reservoirs. Institutional vulnerability was evidenced by disjointed water management institutions with lack of comprehension of roles of higher level institutions by lower level ones. Women are most hit by droughts as they derived more than 90% of their family income from agriculture activities. An enhanced understanding of the vulnerability and risk exposure will assist in developing technologies and policies that conform to the current livelihood strategies of smallholder, resource-constrained farmers. Development of such knowledge base for a catchment opens avenues for computational modeling of the impacts of different types of disasters under different scenarios.

N2  - Globally, drought impacts more people than any other natural hazard. However, drought is also the most complex natural hazard, and its impacts are not evenly distributed across the landscape or among human populations. Just as the impacts of drought vary, so do the coping strategies used by people during drought. The research to-date on drought coping strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly quantitative, focused on top-down interventions, and do not emphasize individual perceptions, experience, and autonomous decision-making when coping with drought. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the human experience of coping with drought through narratives from farmers in Burat and Kinna, Isiolo County, Kenya. This paper highlights (1) their perceived impacts of drought, and (2) the various coping strategies used. A total of 83 interviews were conducted in 20 households. Results found that the perceived impacts of drought were decreased agricultural productivity, livestock hunger, death, and relocation, a lack of water in rivers, human hunger and disease, and violent conflict. The strategies for coping with drought included changing agricultural practices, adopting irrigation, relying on aid, charcoal burning, casual labor, livelihood diversification, and others. Importantly, these coping strategies can be classified into four categories: livelihood diversification, longer-term livelihood strategies, short-term coping activities, and erosive coping strategies. This research contributes to the effort to better document and understand farmers’ perceptions and strategies to cope with drought through qualitative research methods and from the perspective of the individual smallholder farmer, which is important for making context-specific policy and project recommendations aimed at smallholder farmers.

N2  - Smallholder farmers have adopted diverse adaptation practices to lessen the effect of climate change. However, context-specific information about why particular adaptation strategies are adopted remains limited. This study examined the factors that facilitate the choice of farm-level adaptation strategies to climate change (CC) using data collected from 269 African indigenous vegetable (AIV) farmers in Kenya. A multivariate probit (MVP) regression model was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices. The most frequently adopted strategies considered for analysis were manure application, increased pesticide use, crop rotation, irrigation, change of planting dates and terracing. The results reveal that land ownership, group membership, access to extension services and education level were some of the key drivers of adoption. This implies that policies and programmes that are designed to build the ability of smallholder AIV farmers to adapt to climate change should focus on organising farmers into groups, disseminating timely weather information, improving land tenure security, increasing off-farm employment and providing greater access to extension services. © 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

N1  - The Jim Oster Special Issue
N2  - Salinity and waterlogging have impacted agricultural production in arid areas for more than 2000 years. The causes of the problems are well known, as are the methods and investments required to manage salt-affected soils and shallow water tables. Yet the problems persist in many regions where farmers apply excessive irrigation water, and where farmers and irrigation departments fail to invest in adequate drainage solutions. Long ago, Professor E.W. Hilgard described the inevitability of salinity problems in arid areas and the measures required to prevent or overcome those problems. Hilgard warned of impending salinization in California's Central Valley, based partly on his understanding of salinity and waterlogging problems in India. More recently, Jan van Schilfgaarde, Jim Oster, and others also have described the inevitable environmental impacts of irrigation. These authors suggest that irrigation likely can be sustained, but the cost of reducing the environmental impacts to an acceptable level might be substantial in some areas. We review the perspectives of these authors, and others, with an outlook toward a future in which the goal of achieving sustainable irrigation coincides with the goal of intensifying agriculture more generally, to provide food and fiber for an expanding global population. We propose five activities that might be implemented in a comprehensive program to achieve successful management of salinity and waterlogging. We also introduce the notion of implementing a deposit or bond payment for the salt contained in irrigation water deliveries. Farmers would be reimbursed in accordance with their salt management and disposal practices.

N2  - Cotton is the main crop in Uzbekistan. The use of water for irrigation of cotton has a number of environmental consequences, most notably the decreasing of the Aral Sea, and triggering water salinity increase. Modeling of water management for cotton production in the cotton agro-eco zones of Uzbekistan is a challenge constrained by the availability and salinity of water. This research presents a system dynamics model of water management for cotton production in Uzbekistan. Causal loop diagram and stock flow diagram are hypothesized to generate the observed behavior of cotton production system. The model was programmed using the software STELLA and was solved using Runge–Kutta forth order method. Simulated results agree well with the observed data of cotton area and total cotton production quantitatively. Sensitivity analysis of the model have also been addressed. Also the model has been simulated to address the policy issue of investment on drip irrigation, cotton price liberalization, improvement in crop productivity and a mix policy which is combination of these three policies. Finally, the model provides better understanding and greater insights for water management of cotton production for better management of cotton production and can be used as a computer laboratory for scenario building and policy analysis.

N2  - Millions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia benefit from readily available and affordable irrigation technologies. The rapid uptake of small private irrigation in South Asia had a proven positive effect on poverty alleviation. In sub-Saharan Africa similar trends are emerging and several studies point to considerable upscaling potential. Achieving this potential would substantially boost smallholder incomes and food security. However, the spread of small private irrigation poses several challenges related to equity, efficiency, and sustainability. Women and resource poor farmers face challenges accessing affordable technologies; market inefficiencies and policy frameworks negatively affect farmer decision-making and technology access; and the unregulated spread of private irrigation may lead to over-abstraction, pollution, and conflicts. In this paper we argue that carefully designed intervention strategies and policy engagement are needed for two reasons. First, there is a need to address potential adverse effects of the ongoing, unregulated spread of small private irrigation while safeguarding its proven benefits on food security and poverty alleviation. Second, relatively straightforward measures can extend the benefits to a broader group of smallholders, including women and the poor, while at the same time ensuring sustainable use of the resource. Based on empirical evidence from case studies in six countries, we identified four elements of such an approach: (1) enhancing technology access; (2) catalyzing smallholder value chains; (3) fostering supportive policies; and (4) strengthening institutional capacity to manage potential trade-offs at the watershed scale.

N2  - In an attempt to identify solutions to the effects of erratic rainfall patterns and droughts that limit agricultural production growth, the Rwandan government has recently increased investments in irrigation development. In this study, we analyze the adoption of small-scale irrigation technologies (SSITs) and its impact on land productivity using cross-sectional data from a sample of 360 farmers in Rwanda. The study uses the propensity score matching technique to address potential self-selection bias. Our results reveal that adoption decisions are significantly influenced by factors such as education, farm size, group membership, gender, extension services, access to credit, access to weather forecast information, risk perceptions, access to a reliable source of water for irrigation, awareness of rainwater harvesting techniques, and awareness of subsidy programs. In addition, the results show that the adoption of SSITs has a significantly positive impact on land productivity. The study concludes with policy implications that highlight the need to promote the adoption of SSITs among farmers as a strategy to improve agricultural productivity and food security in Rwanda.

N2  - In the past three decades successive “Irrigation Improvement Projects” (IIP) have been implemented in the Nile Valley and Delta of Egypt. They have consisted in replacing scattered individual pumps by collective pumps serving distribution networks at the tertiary level, while ensuring a continuous flow in secondary canals, in lieu of the rotational system. This intervention has been praised as “a state-of-the-art project” spearheading the ‘modernization’ of irrigation in Egypt. Given their ambitious objectives and the massive investment of capital planned - the 1986 policy’s target was to ‘improve’ one million ha by the year 2000 - these modernization efforts warrant thorough independent evaluation. This article attempts to revisit the achievements of the project after 30 years of implementation by presenting findings derived from fieldwork surveys carried out in the central part of the Delta. We document how these socio-technical innovations perform on the ground, how they change water distribution and how, in turn, they are adopted and reshaped by farmers. Understanding the contexts in which improvement projects are most beneficial, and the conditions under which such investments may be at risk, leads us to make recommendations as to how the design and implementation of these projects can be improved but also to ask whether such investment is essential for the country.

N2  - Understanding the spatio-temporal changes of vegetation and its climatic control factors can provide an important theoretical basis for the protection and restoration of eco-environments. In this study, we analyzed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) from 2002 to 2018 via trend analysis, stability analysis, and Mann-Kendall mutation test to investigate the change of vegetation. In addition, we also used the skewness analysis and correlation analysis to explore the contribution of climate change and human activities on regional vegetation changes. The results indicated that the overall increasing trend of NDVI from 2002 to 2018 was significant. The areas showing increased NDVI were mainly distributed in the southeastern CLP and the irrigation districts of the Yellow River to the north and west of the CLP, while the areas showing decreased NDVI were concentrated in the desert of the western Ordos Plateau, Longzhong Loess Plateau, and the built-up and adjacent areas. Precipitation was the dominant factor contributing to vegetation growth in the CLP, while vegetation was less dependent on precipitation in the irrigation districts. The increasement of NDVI has led to a prolonged response time of vegetation to water stress and a lag effect of less than two months in the CLP. The effect of temperature on NDVI was not significant; significant negative correlations between NDVI and temperature were found only in the desert, the Guanzhong Plain, the southern Liupan Mountains, and the southeastern Taihang Mountains, owing to high temperatures, urban heat islands, and large cloud cover in mountainous areas. Affected by the “Grain for Green Program” (GGP), NDVI in the CLP increased from 2002 to 2018; however, the increasing trends of NDVI for different vegetation cover types were significantly different owing to the difference in background status. The increasing contribution rate of NDVI in the CLP mainly came from crops and steppes. Urban not only led to the destruction of vegetation but also had radiation effect causing negative impact of NDVI around the cities. This resulted in the aggravation of the negative bias of NDVI with time in the CLP. The results provide a long-term perspective for regional vegetation protection and utilization in the CLP.

N2  - Agricultural water interventions (AWI), e.g. in-situ soil and water
conservation strategies, irrigation, and damming of rivers to increase
groundwater recharge, have been suggested as important strategies-to
improve yields in tropical agriculture. Although the biophysical
implications of AWIs have been well investigated, the coupling between
the biophysical changes and the economic implications thereof is less
well understood. In this study we translate the results from a
hydrological model, SWAT, on crop yields for different cropping systems
with and without agricultural water interventions, to hypothetical farm
incomes for a watershed, Kothapally, located in Andhra Pradesh, India.
It was found that on average, AWI significantly improved farm incomes by
enabling the cultivation of a high value crop during the monsoon season
(cotton), supplementary irrigated to bridge dry spells and replacing a
traditional crop (sorghum), and also by enhancing the capacity to
produce dry season, fully irrigated vegetable crops, in this case
exemplified by onion. AWI combined with cotton resulted in more than a
doubling of farm incomes compared to traditional sorghum-based systems
without AWI during normal and wet years (i.e. for 75% of the years).
Interestingly, we observed that the difference between the AWI system
and the no intervention system was larger during years of high average
rainfall compared to dry years. It was also found that access to
irrigation was more important for farm income than crop choice and AWI
per se, and thus farms with access irrigation benefitted more from AWI
compared to farmers lacking access to irrigation. In conclusion, we
suggest that in order to assess equity aspects in terms of farm income
generation following the implementation of an AWI project, there is a
need for income analyses at the farm level, since income estimates at
the watershed level may mask important differences in economic benefits
between farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Rainwater harvesting and its utilization have a very important role to play in harnessing the production potential within dryland systems. This study assesses the performance of small rainwater harvesting structures (farm-ponds) in 5 major rainfed states of India over the period 2009–2011 using data from multiple sources and stakeholders. Rainwater which is harvested using structures of varying types and sizes was used for either supplemental irrigation or recharging open-wells. In many cases, the farm level rainwater harvesting structures were highly effective for rainfed farming and had a multiplier effect on farm income. In some situations however, it was viewed by farmers as a waste of productive land. The use of farm ponds in Maharashtra, for example, resulted in a significant increase in farm productivity (12–72%), cropping intensity and consequently farm income. In the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, farm pond water was profitably used for supplemental irrigation to mango plantations, vegetables or other crops and animal enterprises with net returns estimated to be between US$ 120 and 320 structure−1annum−1. Despite such examples, the adoption of the farm ponds was low, except in Maharashtra. A functional analysis of the reasons for high adoption of water harvesting structures indicated that factors such as technical support, customized design, level of farmer participation, age, existing ownership of open wells, annual rainfall and household assets were the major determinants of performance of farm-level rainwater harvesting structures. Based on this countrywide analysis, different policy and institutional options are proposed for promoting farm-level rainwater-harvesting for dryland agriculture.

N2  - We develop an Israeli version of the Multi-Year Water Allocation System (MYWAS) mathematical programming model to conduct statewide, long-term analyses of three topics associated with agricultural reuse of wastewater. We find that: (1) enabling agricultural irrigation with treated wastewater significantly reduces the optimal capacity levels of seawater and brackish-water desalination over the simulated 3-decade period, and increases Israel's welfare by 3.3 billion USD in terms of present values; (2) a policy requiring desalination of treated wastewater pre-agricultural reuse, as a method to prevent long-run damage to the soil and groundwater, reduces welfare by 2.7 billion USD; hence, such a policy is warranted only if the avoided damages exceed this welfare loss; (3) desalination of treated wastewater in order to increase freshwater availability for agricultural irrigation is not optimal, since the costs overwhelm the generated agricultural benefits. We also find the results associated with these three topics to be sensitive to the natural recharge of Israel's freshwater aquifers, and to the rate at which domestic-water demand evolves due to population and income growth.

N2  - Predicted hotter and drier climatic conditions in the Mediterranean Basin will probably hamper current afforestations and reforestations by negatively influencing tree performance. Understanding how saplings can adjust their physiology to shortages in water availability is essential to predict early-stage success of forest ecological restoration. Pines are common target species used in afforestations and reforestations; however, the capacity of their saplings for physiological plasticity to promote drought tolerance remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the demographical and resource-use consequences of short-term irrigation among four pine species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinea, Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris) growing under water-limiting conditions in a common garden experiment. Summer irrigation increased the survival rate of those pines that were suffering from hydric stress under the xeric conditions of the common garden (i.e. P. pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris). Moreover, short-term water supplementation slightly enhanced aboveground biomass production across species. However, leaf isotopic composition and nutrient concentrations did not change after summer irrigation. Independently of water supplementation, P. halepensis was the best adapted species to water scarcity and showed the best physiological and growth performance. By contrast, P. pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris saplings exhibited drought-induced reductions in stomatal conductance and low water-use efficiency, nutrient deficiency, and severe N:P and N:K stoichiometric imbalances, leading to impaired growth. We conclude that the lack of physiological plasticity of water-stressed pine saplings to withstand the impacts of climate aridification will likely cause severe impairment of their nutrient status, growth and survival, with dire implications for the successful establishment of Mediterranean afforestation and reforestation programs.

N2  - The recession of the South Aral Sea over the last few decades has become a great environmental challenge in Central Asia. Due to declining inflow and irrigation exhaustion, the Amu Darya River vanishes before reaching the South Aral Sea. Therefore, groundwater (GW) has become the vital water source for the South Aral Sea surface water and the local ecosystem. To develop feasible adaptation strategies for water resource management, it is necessary to quantify the GW flux into the South Aral Sea under ongoing climate change. Based on numerical models (MODFLOW and SWAT) and with the support of observed data, remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and the output of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the hydraulic connection between a shallow aquifer and the lake was investigated and projected for future change. The GW model was calibrated by one in-situ GW well and six Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived GW heads. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GW flow field simulation (MODFLOW) was lower than 0.21 m from 2005 to 2016. Under three shared socioeconomic pathways (sustainable pathway, medium pathway, and fossil-fueled development), the GCMs indicate that the evapotranspiration (ET) experiences the greatest change, and will potentially rise to 602.6 mm/yr by 2100 in fossil-fueled development. While the precipitation and the runoff of the Amu Darya River will both rise slightly, and with the range of 146.4–163.3 mm/yr and 107.8–118.4 m3/s from 2021 to 2100 separately, and the increase is mainly during winter. With climate change signals forcing on the historical hydrometeorological data, the simulation result revealed that the GW contributes to more than 78 % of the total influx of water into the lake during 2021–2100, and the predicted GW flux into the lake will slightly rise over time. However, the ET will also increase due to rising temperatures and may gradually outpace the recharge growth. The simulation results indicate that the South Aral Sea may maintain a surface area of 4.47×103km2 in fossil-fueled development, which means it will continue to shrink if there is no human intervention. Therefore, a set of sustainable water resource management methods is urgently needed to preserve the ecological environment of the South Aral Sea and prevent ecological disasters.

N2  - Waterlogging is one of the most important agricultural disasters affecting rice. In this study, we developed a waterlogging analysis system for paddy fields in irrigation districts with 7 modules, including pretreatment, hydrological computations and waterlogging computations. The newly developed system can consider the effects of both landform features and human interventions in irrigation districts. Observational data from the Gaoyou Irrigation District during 2014 and 2015 were applied to calibrate and validate a waterlogging analysis system, respectively. The results indicated that the waterlogging analysis system could accurately predict the water levels in both the calibration (R2 > 0.97) and validation (R2 > 0.92) periods. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the yield reduction rate indicated that saturated soil moisture and shape parameters (α and n) were the dominant soil hydrodynamic parameters affecting the simulated yield reduction rates. The weighted mean yield reduction rate of field areas decreased with increasing shape parameters and increased with increasing soil moisture saturation. However, further analysis showed that the maximum yield reduction rate exhibited a trend similar to that of saturated soil moisture, which indicated that the backwater effects of the river and ditch water level changes had a greater influence than the soil hydrodynamic parameters on the yield reduction rate, especially in low-elevation fields. In addition, the relationship between the yield reduction rate and field elevation could be fitted by an exponential function (R2 = 0.83), and the field pond depth decreased linearly with a reduction in field elevation in both 2014 (R2 = 0.36, p < 0.01) and 2015 (R2 = 0.64, p < 0.01). The proposed waterlogging analysis system could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of waterlogging on rice production in the studied irrigation district or in other regions with similar climatic conditions.

N2  - This paper analyzes the effect of water supply uncertainty on farmers’ choice of crop portfolio. The paper presents an innovative model to estimate the value of uncertainty of water supply, and then tests the model using data from Israel. The modeling results provide support to the hypothesis that uncertainty induces farmers to prefer crops whose growth requires less agricultural capital accumulation, despite their lower profitability (agricultural capital referring to trees and other plants which take a significant period of time to mature). This is due to the risk that in a given year water supply will fall below a certain minimal level, thereby causing loss of all accumulated capital. The paper also examines a government intervention policy for mitigating uncertainty: use of reclaimed wastewater in crop irrigation as a supplement for freshwater supply. The costs associated with constructing the required wastewater reclamation and supply facilities are compared to the benefits of additional farm income earned through a more certain on-farm water supply. It is shown that under certain conditions implementation of this policy is indeed economically worthwhile.

N2  - Understanding the spatial variation of agricultural livelihood vulnerability to climate change is crucial for developing adaptation strategies in the future, something that has only been seldom done so far in developing economies like Bangladesh. To this end, we developed an integrated vulnerability index (IVI) based on the IPCC framework for analyzing and mapping the vulnerability of agricultural livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh. The IVI was calculated as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. We used 45 indicators from nationally comparable and reliable datasets to conduct the research. Besides, a socio-economic livelihood vulnerability index (SELVI) was developed on the basis of sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators and displayed in a scatter diagram in order to identify the socio-economically more vulnerable districts of coastal Bangladesh. A circumplex chart was used to disaggregate the normalized indices of sensitivity and adaptive capacity components, allowing the researcher to discover the factors that cause and mitigate the vulnerability. Using the IVI information, a vulnerability map was created that revealed that Patuakhali, Noakhali, Bhola, and Barguna districts in the exposed central coastal region were the topmost vulnerable districts, reflecting the fact that the agricultural livelihoods of 7.3 million people were highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The geographical diversity in salt intrusion, river-bank erosion, dependence ratio, crop yield, literacy, the density of physicians in the hospital, disaster-resistant houses, shelter facilities, and irrigated farming areas contributed to the diverse coastal agricultural livelihood vulnerability.

N2  - Limited knowledge and experimental data exist on pesticide leaching through partially frozen soil. The objective of this study was to better understand the complex processes of freezing and thawing and the effects these processes have on water flow and pesticide transport through soil. To achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non-reactive tracer and the herbicide MCPA in partially frozen soil. In total 40 intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types (silt and loam) in South-East Norway were used in this experiment. MCPA and bromide were applied on top of all columns. Half the columns were then frozen at −3 °C while the other half of the columns were stored at +4 °C. Columns were then subjected to repeated irrigation events at a rate of 5 mm artificial rainwater for 5 h at each event. Each irrigation was followed by 14-day periods of freezing or refrigeration. Percolate was collected and analysed for MCPA and bromide. The results show that nearly 100% more MCPA leached from frozen than unfrozen topsoil columns of Hov silt and Kroer loam soils. Leaching patterns of bromide and MCPA were very similar in frozen columns with high concentrations and clear peaks early in the irrigation process, and with lower concentrations leaching at later stages. Hardly any MCPA leached from unfrozen topsoil columns (0.4–0.5% of applied amount) and concentrations were very low. Bromide showed a different flow pattern indicating a more uniform advective-dispersive transport process in the unfrozen columns with higher concentrations leaching but without clear concentration peaks. This study documents that pesticides can be preferentially transported through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil. These findings indicate, that monitoring programs should include sampling during snow melt or early spring in areas were soil frost is common as this period could imply exposure peaks in groundwater or surface water.

N2  - Increasing atmospheric temperatures will be detrimental for growth functions of various crop plants, more so in mungbean, for its increasing demand during spring/summer season in major growing regions in Northern parts of India. This necessitates broadening scope of mungbean adaptation to warmer climates. Hence, a study was conducted to evaluate high temperature effect on different mungbean lines for their vegetative and reproductive performances. Forty one mungbean lines were grown in containers under full irrigation condition in outdoors; screened for growth and yield traits at two sowing dates: (1) the normal sowing time (NS) in March, so that day/night temperatures during the reproductive stage were <40/28°C, and (2) late-sown (LS) in April so that temperatures during the reproductive stage were higher (>40/28°C). In LS plants, leaves showed symptoms of leaf rolling and scorching and chlorosis compared to NS plants. Adding to that, the phenology was accelerated, leading to a sizable reduction in leaf area, biomass, flowers and pods. Interestingly, shortening of flowering time and podding duration was evident that augment decreased pod and seed yields. Further, in LS plants, reproductive function was distinctly condensed in most of the lines, causing increased flower and pod abortions, implying, heat stress during the reproductive phase of late sown plants of mungbean was found to be injurious. A few promising heat-tolerant lines (EC693357, EC693358, EC693369, Harsha and ML1299) have been identified, which would not only serve as useful donor/s for breeding programs, also act suitable base plant source to gain more insights on heat stress induced effects in cell metabolism.

N2  - Climate variability impacts differentially on irrigators depending on water availability and quality, climate, crop, and policy instruments such as water markets. Water policy directs available water allocations at a regional scale, while irrigators adapt via decisions about crop selection and water management, for example through deficit irrigation and adoption of water efficient technologies, respond via changes to water use at the farm and sectoral scale. Water markets allow these two scales to interact, in effect transferring water across regions and states. In this paper we used a positive mathematical programming model to examine the interacting impact of these two incremental adaptation options on regional water use and agriculture production for four climate variability states of nature across the Southern Murray-Darling Basin. Our results show the impacts of climate variability and the effectiveness of adaptation options that vary across regions. Our conclusions have implications for understanding regional difference in adjusting to climate variability. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Sustainable agricultural development covers all aspects of agricultural production involving the water-food-energy nexus (WFEN) and considers the effects of agricultural activities on society, economy and ecology. Multi-objective optimization models play an important role in making tradeoff among multiple interests of stakeholders. Aimed at canal-based irrigated agricultural areas, water allocation highly depends on canal distribution, and the spatial location of irrigation regions determines their water-intake order, which usually induces serious water allocation inequality. The social, economic and ecological problems resulting from water inequality would deteriorate without intervention and seriously impact sustainable development. Thus, optimization models must consider water use equity, water-intake order as well as water equilibrium simultaneously. However, this will greatly increase computational efforts and solution difficulty. The problem becomes worse when uncertain factors are involved. In order to overcome these difficulties, a distributed multi-objective uncertain optimization model was established to help develop comprehensive strategies for agricultural sustainability. A novel robust solution method was proposed to offer an efficient way to handle stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties from the perspective of feasibility and optimality robustness. Finally, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the practical application of the developed model. The results offer managers insights on agricultural sustainable development.

N2  - The unidirectional impacts of soil conservation on dryland farming and local livelihood have been well studied. However, there are gaps in literature regarding the interactions among factors, such as labor force and financial capital, in response to soil conservation, as well as the influence of such interactions on the relationships between environmental projects and agricultural development. By combining the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) model and statistical analyses, this study investigated the spatio-temporal characteristics of soil erosion while also identifying the controlling factors that affect crop and livestock farming. The aim was to reveal how these factors interacted to influence agriculture in two case study areas between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that soil erosion substantially declined as a consequence of soil conservation, while the output from crop farming increased, indicating that there was a synergy between soil conservation and dryland farming in both the districts, over time; and factors facilitating crop farming, such as labor force, agricultural machinery, and irrigation, appeared to exert an adverse effect on livestock farming in both areas, implying a tradeoff between livestock and crop farming in the context of programs such as the Grain for Green Program (GGP) in the Loess Hills. Such a tradeoff is a result of the competition for cropland and labor that exists due to grazing prohibition and rural-urban migration. Therefore, policy-related resolutions are required to address the land use conflicts and migration-related rural labor losing due to implementation of the GGP in the Loess Hills.

N2  - Stakeholders have diverse purposes for analyzing economic, environmental and social sustainability indicators of rice production systems. Our aim was to show the added value of identifying external target values of the Sustainable Rice Platform’'s 12 performance indicators in addition to internal descriptive statistics values such as median and top decile performance for each indicator. Using household survey data from 1499 households in seven favorable rice production areas across seven countries in Asia, we identified baseline and target values appropriate to each indicator and illustrated their use for three purposes: assessing the outcomes of an extension program, comparing tradeoffs associated with two widely-used crop establishment methods, and providing individual feedback to a farmer about how to improve farm performance. We worked with our large survey data set and external reference values to calculate specific target values for each of the 12 indicators. These target values were used to evaluate the effectiveness of an extension program, showing that the extension program resulted in an improvement in scores for most indicators but did not achieve the target values for any of them. A comparison of wet-direct seeded rice (widely practice in irrigated regions of Vietnam, Thailand, and Sri Lanka) vs. puddled transplanted rice (China, Indonesia, Myanmar) indicated that there was a trade-off with wet-direct seeding having better labor productivity and greenhouse gas emission but worse pesticide use, and that both establishment methods had lower profitability than the target value. For the advice provided to an individual farmer, it was useful to be able to show both what the neighbors' average performance was and how far that was from the target values. Our illustrations demonstrate that using target values for indicators adds depth to the interpretation of indicator data.

N2  - Climate change, uncertain future water supplies, growing population, and increased water demands continue to raise the importance of finding cost-effective water conservation measures. Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest water user, so governments, donor organizations, water suppliers, and farmers continue to look for measures that would produce more crop per drop. Despite the importance of promoting water conservation in agriculture, little work has been done that integrates hydrologic, economic, institutional, and policy dimensions of water conservation. This paper presents an integrated basin scale analysis of water conservation subsidies for irrigated agriculture. A dynamic, nonlinear programming model is developed and applied for the Upper Rio Grande Basin of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, USA. Several potential public subsidies of drip irrigation are analyzed for their economic and hydrologic impacts at both the farm and basin levels. Results indicate that water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation produce several effects. These include greater on-farm implementation of water-conserving technology, less water applied to crops, more water consumed by crops, increased farm income, greater crop production, more land irrigated, and increased total water-related economic benefits for the basin. Findings provide a framework for designing and implementing water conservation policies for irrigated agriculture. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Water, energy, food, and environment are highly interconnected, with intricate dependencies and multiple uncertainties involved in agricultural system. This paper presents a novel water-energy-food-environment nexus (WEFEN) optimization model for sustainable development of agriculture. The developed model incorporates stochastic multi-objective programming, triangular fuzzy numbers, fuzzy credibility-constrained programming, mixed-integer programming, non-linear programming, and Stewart model into a general optimization framework. The model is capable of (1) balancing the tradeoffs among socio-economic, resources, and environmental concerns; (2) generating valid WEFEN management solutions achieving the targets of maximum net economic benefit, maximum renewable energy production, minimum water footprint, and minimum carbon footprint simultaneously; (3) dealing with complexities and uncertainties existed in agricultural WEFEN systems. The model was applied to the Zhanghe irrigation district to give policy-makers insights into what efforts should be made towards sustainable agricultural management. Flexible alternatives were generated under different scenarios and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results highlighted the significance of improvement of internal water storage capacity, reasonable farmland management, and compromise decision preferences. The proposed methodology is applicable for other agriculture-centered regions suffering from multifold resources and environment crisis.

N2  - The forested areas of northern Vietnam, mostly located in mountainous areas, have important watershed regulating functions. However, current land-use changes pose a threat to the continuing provision of environmental services. This chapter investigates two alternative payment for environmental services (PES) programs tailored to reestablish natural or productive forests in the uplands of northern Vietnam: “Payments for Forest” (PFF) and “Terraces for Forest” (TFF). Both programs involve setting aside sloping land for reforestation but they differ in the type and amount of compensation offered. PFF offers annual payments per area of retired land. TFF offers to convert a certain amount of the current sloping land into a terraced area, combined with annual payments per area of retired land. The main objective of the chapter is to compare the two types of programs in terms of potential participation (what type of farmers will likely participate?), and what impact it would have on their revenues. Using mathematical programming, we developed a set of farm models corresponding to typical farms of a mountainous district of northern Vietnam. We simulated the level of participation of different types of farms for the two types of PES programs. For each specific PES, we analyzed participation, measured by the area of land converted into forest land and its impacts on land use and household revenues. Results show that, given the assumptions of the models, increasing access to irrigated terraces as a way to compensate for land conversion to forest increases the participation of the poorest farmers. Therefore, our research suggests that PES schemes, when fine-tuned to a Southeast Asian context, may not only be used as a way to restore ecosystem services but also as a way to alleviate poverty.

N2  - A systemic approach was proposed to analyse a complex system such that of food value chains. Typical management methodologies were applied to a citrus derivatives industry and, based on the survey outcomes, a sustainable optimisation plan was formulated integrating the critical domains of the water-food-energy nexus. The overall process was mapped in detail. The SWOT analysis was applied to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to each step of the production chain of the citrus derived products. To prioritize its critical output factors, the Impact-Feasibility Map tool was defined. Critical issues characterised by the highest impact and easiest feasibility were the un-optimized fertilization and irrigation, non-objective human inspections, lack of production standardization and accumulation of organic waste. Structured interviews to the company managers were conducted to identify the most relevant company's needs. With a view on process and product sustainability, suggestions based on good manufacturing practices and on literature were scheduled within a 10-years industrial development plan accomplishing a circular economy scheme. The performed analysis is preliminary to optimisation actions in view of process sustainability that will be carried out according to the classic engineering approach. The present actual goal is to contextualize the engineering interventions in relation to the needs of the producers. Indeed, empirical contextualised research will be necessary to assess whether the sustainable actions and measures identified in this study can be validated in actual practice with conventional chemical engineering optimisation procedures.

N2  - Crop yield gap (Yg) can be disaggregated into two components: (i) one that is consistent across years and is, therefore, attributable to persistent factors that limit yields, and (ii) a second that varies from year to year due to inconsistent constraints on yields. Quantifying relative contributions of persistent and non-persistent factors to overall Yg, and identifying their underpinning causes, can help identify sound interventions to narrow current Yg and estimate magnitude of likely impact. The objective of this study was to apply this analytical framework to quantify the contribution of persistent factors to current Yg in high-yield irrigated maize systems in western US Corn Belt and identify some of the underpinning explanatory factors. We used a database containing producer yields collected during 10 years (2004–2013) from ca. 3000 irrigated fields in three regions of the state of Nebraska (USA). Yield potential was estimated for each region-year using a crop simulation model and actual weather and management data. Yg was calculated for each field-year as the difference between simulated yield potential and field yield. Two independent sources of field yield data were used: (i) producer-reported yields, and (ii) estimated yields using a combined satellite-crop model approach that does not rely on actual yield data. In each year (hereafter called ‘ranking years’), fields were grouped into ‘small’ and ‘large’ Yg categories. For a given category, Yg persistence was calculated by comparing mean Yg estimated for ranking years against mean Yg calculated, for the same group of fields, for the rest of the years. Explanatory factors for persistent Yg were assessed. Yg persistence ranged between ca. 30% and 50% across regions, with higher persistence in regions with heterogeneous soils. Estimates of Yg size and persistence based on producer-reported yields and satellite-model approach were in reasonable agreement, though the latter approach consistently underestimated Yg size and persistence. Small Yg category exhibited a higher frequency of fields with favorable soils and soybean-maize rotation and greater N fertilizer and irrigation inputs relative to the large Yg category. Remarkably, despite higher applied inputs, efficiencies in the use of N fertilizer, irrigation, and solar radiation were much higher in fields exhibiting small Yg. The framework implemented in this study can be applied to any cropping system for which a reasonable number of field-year yield and management data are available.

N2  - Water scarcity affects many countries around the world, and increases in severity over time as populations grow and climate change further intensifies. Governments and water regulators address increased water scarcity in a regional setting by introducing policy interventions, including non-structural, such as pricing mechanisms and quotas to affect demand, and supply management means, such as water storage and extraction. One of the most extreme policy interventions is to build infrastructure to move water from locations where it is abundant to locations facing scarcity. Such interventions are known as intra- and inter-basin transfers (IBTs) of water and have been quite frequently practiced in many river basins around the world in recent years. In moving water from one place to another benefits and costs are realized, some of which are private and some are public in nature. The objective of this paper is to discern whether or not the documented IBTs have been sustainable in addressing scarcity. Since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for IBTs, we apply a variation of the QUAlitative Structural Approach for Ranking (QUASAR) method to 121 studies of documented IBTs within 40 territories and basins around the world, using five attributes of impact that were found to be associated with the transfers. Our findings suggest that the majority of the IBTs have been associated with overall negligible or negative impacts on the water-exporting regions, the water-transmitting regions, or the water-importing regions within the basins studied. Our findings also suggest that IBTs that were meant to relieve higher levels of water scarcity in the importing regions might be more prone to overall negative impacts.

N2  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 risk associated with the consumption of fresh cut-cos lettuce during Australian industrial practices was assessed. A probabilistic risk assessment model was developed and implemented in the @Risk software by using the Monte Carlo simulation technique with 1,000,000 iterations. Australian preharvest practices yielded predicted annual mean E. coli O157:H7 levels from 0.2 to −3.4 log CFU/g and prevalence values ranged from 2 to 6.4%. While exclusion of solar radiation from the baseline model yielded a significant increase in concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (−5.2 -log fold), drip irrigation usage, exclusion of manure amended soil and rainfall reduced E. coli O157:H7 levels by 7.4, 6.5, and 4.3-log fold, respectively. The microbial quality of irrigation water and irrigation type both had a significant effect on E. coli O157:H7 concentrations at harvest (p < 0.05). The probability of illness due to consumption of E. coli O157:H7 contaminated fresh cut-cos lettuce when water washing interventions were introduced into the processing module, was reduced by 1.4–2.7-log fold (p < 0.05). This study provides a robust basis for assessment of risk associated with E. coli O157:H7 contamination on fresh cut-cos lettuce for industrial practices and will assist the leafy green industry and food safety authorities in Australia to identify potential risk management strategies.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of farm
irrigation systems in the Cebalat district in northern Tunisia. It
addressed the challenging topic of sustainable agriculture through a
bio-economic approach linking a biophysical model to an economic
optimisation model. A crop growth simulation model (CropSyst) was used
to build a database to determine the relationships between agricultural
practices, crop yields and environmental effects (salt accumulation in
soil and leaching of nitrates) in a context of high climatic
variability. The database was then fed into a recursive stochastic model
set for a 10-year plan that allowed analysing the effects of cropping
patterns on farm income, salt accumulation and nitrate leaching. We
assumed that the long-term sustainability of soil productivity might be
in conflict with farm profitability in the short-term. Assuming a
discount rate of 10% (for the base scenario), the model closely
reproduced the current system and allowed to predict the degradation of
soil quality due to long-term salt accumulation. The results showed that
there was more accumulation of salt in the soil for the base scenario
than for the alternative scenario (discount rate of 0%). This result
was induced by applying a higher quantity of water per hectare for the
alternative as compared to a base scenario. The results also showed that
nitrogen leaching is very low for the two discount rates and all climate
scenarios. In conclusion, the results show that the difference in farm
income between the alternative and base scenarios increases over time to
attain 45% after 10 years. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Overhead (sprinkler) irrigation is commonly used for spring frost protection of cranberries in southeastern Massachusetts, United States. Historically, conventional forms of irrigation management have been used, generally consisting of running irrigation pumps continuously throughout the night and into the early morning until ambient air temperature reached 1–2°C above the critical temperature of the plant. However, a general paucity of information exists on the horticultural and hydrological effects of on-off “cycling” of irrigation pumps based on pre-programmed temperature setpoints. To fill this gap, three years of monitoring were conducted to quantify the relative effects of cycled and conventional spring frost irrigation on cranberry bud damage, crop yield, and water use. Results showed that cycled irrigation reduced seasonal water use from 33 to 80% compared to conventional frost irrigation, with water savings under cycled frost irrigation ranging from 113 to 198mm (mean±SD: 176±47mm). Despite some variation in type and amount of observed bud damage, values of cranberry yield were similar between the two methods or higher for cycled irrigation. The conventional frost irrigation method always applied more irrigation water, possibly increasing soil saturation and anaerobic conditions that are known to lower crop yield in cranberry. Together, these results point to cycled irrigation as a water management strategy that can enhance cranberry production and reduce agricultural water use in southeastern Massachusetts.

N2  - Excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is the main cause of N loss and poor use efficiency in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the North China Plain (NCP). Drip fertigation is considered to be an effective method for improving N use efficiency and reducing losses, while the performance of drip fertigation in winter wheat is limited by poor N scheduling. A two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the growth, development and yield of drip-fertigated winter wheat under different split urea (46% N, 240 kg ha−1) applications. The six treatments consisted of five fertigation N application scheduling programs and one slow-release fertilizer (SRF) application. The five N scheduling treatments were N0–100 (0% at sowing and 100% at jointing/booting), N25–75 (25% at sowing and 75% at jointing and booting), N50–50 (50% at sowing and 50% at jointing/booting), N75–25 (75% at sowing and 25 at jointing/booting), and N100–0 (100% at sowing and 0% at jointing/booting). The SRF (43% N, 240 kg ha−1) was only used as fertilizer at sowing. Split N application significantly (P<0.05) affected wheat grain yield, yield components, aboveground biomass (ABM), water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen partial factor productivity (NPFP). The N50–50 and SRF treatments respectively had the highest yield (8.84 and 8.85 t ha−1), ABM (20.67 and 20.83 t ha−1), WUE (2.28 and 2.17 kg m−3) and NPFP (36.82 and 36.88 kg kg−1). This work provided substantial evidence that urea-N applied in equal splits between basal and topdressing doses compete economically with the highly expensive SRF for fertilization of winter wheat crops. Although the single-dose SRF could reduce labor costs involved with the traditional method of manual spreading, the drip fertigation system used in this study with the N50–50 treatment provides an option for farmers to maintain wheat production in the NCP.

N2  - Kenaf is a warm-season species that recently has been proved to be a good source of biomass for cellulose pulp for the paper industry in Mediterranean countries, where the use of hemp is problematic for legal reasons. A two-year research program aiming at studying the effects of different water regimes and nitrogen fertilization levels, upon plant growth, leaf area index, biomass accumulation, water and radiation use efficiency, was carried out on kenaf under a typically semi-arid Mediterranean climate of South Italy. In cv. Tainung 2, four different water regimes (I0=no irrigation, I25, I50 and I100=25, 50 and 100% ETc restoration, respectively) and three nitrogen levels (N0=no nitrogen, N75 and N150=75 and 150kgha−1 of N, respectively) were studied. The amount of water applied strongly affected plant growth (in terms of LAI, plant height and biomass) and final total and stem dry yield, which significantly increased from I0 to I100. Nitrogen did not exert any beneficial effect upon dry yield. Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE), calculated in the second year only, was the highest (1.95gDMMJ−1) in fully irrigated treatment (I100) and the lowest (0.86gDMMJ−1) in the dry control. Water use efficiency (WUE) was rather similar among water regimes, whilst irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) progressively increased with the decrease of total volume of water distributed to the crop by irrigation, from 3.47 to 12.45kgm−3 in 2004 and from 4.27 to 7.72kgm−3 in 2005. The results obtained from this research demonstrate that in semi-arid areas of South Italy, irrigation at a reduced rate (50% ETc restoration) may be advantageous, since it allowed a 42–45% irrigation water saving, when compared to the fully irrigation treatment, against a 23% (in 2004) and 36% (in 2005) yield reduction, and a still good efficiency (near that potential) in transforming the solar radiation in dry biomass was maintained (RUE=1.76gDMMJ−1, against 1.95gDMMJ−1 in fully irrigated treatment).

N2  - Although land application (or reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation) is a potentially successful alternative to the disposal of treated wastewater into fresh water streams, its economic feasibility has not been adequately examined. The focus of this paper is to investigate the economic feasibility of land application in the presence of a reservoir with different capacities and to compare the outcome to the application without a storage reservoir. A 5-year dynamic linear programming model was developed to determine the optimal cropping pattern that will consume all or most of the effluent throughout the optimization horizon, utilize all the effluent's nitrogen (being the most limiting constituent) and bring in the highest revenues. A case study in Tyre region, South Lebanon, was used for model application. Three scenarios were developed and then compared to no-storage scenario. The first scenario represents the current existing cropping pattern, while in the second and third new crops were added in addition to the current ones. Supplementary irrigation was allowed in the first and the third scenarios. The three scenarios were tested for different reservoir capacities. The results indicate that the presence of a reservoir enhances the efficiency of the wastewater usage and the flexibility of the associated cropping pattern. The results also indicate that there is a trade-off between the storage capacity and the presence of supplementary irrigation of fresh water. As the storage capacity increases, less land and fresh water are needed, more effluent volume is consumed and higher net returns are achieved as compared to no reservoir situation.

N2  - This article investigates the climate vulnerabilities of four least developed Asian countries—Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Maldives—before discussing how efforts are underway to strengthen infrastructural, organizational, and community-based adaptation. Infrastructural adaptation refers to the assets, technologies, or “hardware” that can withstand climate change impacts, such as climate-proofed irrigation systems, roads, or electricity networks. Organizational adaptation refers to the endurance of an effective institution or set of institutions, usually government ministries or departments, in charge of planning and policy, as well as its capacity to develop and revise climate policies. Social adaptation refers to the cohesion of communities and the livelihoods of the people that compose them. We argue that resilient adaptation infrastructures can recover quickly from climate disruptions, resilient organizations can cope with new stresses and changes and still function, resilient communities have assets such as education or wealth that enable them to survive or even thrive in the face of climate-related challenges. Ongoing adaptation efforts in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Maldives are examples of projects that simultaneously attempt to enhance all three dimensions of adaptation. Data for these cases comes primarily from a review of country National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) supplemented with research interviews and site visits.

N2  - The current study evaluated the development and growth of three major rapeseed genotypes (Hyola308, Hyola401, and RGS003 as early-, mid-, and late-maturity genotypes, respectively) as well as seed yield under different irrigation regimes (full irrigation, withholding irrigation at the flowering stage, withholding irrigation at the pod initiation stage, and withholding irrigation at the seed filling period) and also the spatial yield potential. APSIM-Canola model was applied to investigate the response of rapeseed genotypes to irrigation regimes in ten locations. Simulated results indicated that yield potential for rapeseed production was higher in the west which is a temperate agro-climatic zone (2852.6 kg ha−1) than in the southwest which is a hot agro-climatic zone (1885.1 kg ha−1). Although Hyola401 (the mid-maturity genotype) had the maximum seed yield (2798.4 kg ha−1), RGS003 (the late-maturity genotype) was found to be more drought-resistant due to a lower decrease in seed yield (18.1 %) under water-limited conditions compared with full irrigation conditions. The current findings suggest that the mid-maturity genotype has more yield potential in the studied locations (with different climates and soils) under full irrigation conditions due to higher seed yield, and the late-maturity genotype can be suggested as a resistant genotype for future breeding programs to introduce new-high-yielding genotypes with high drought tolerance, especially in drought-prone environments. Furthermore, withholding irrigation at seed filling onwards, which showed the lowest decrease in seed yield (13.6 %), can be recommended as a strategy for water-saving at the end of the growing season, and farmers can allocate irrigation water to other crops.

N2  - Olive cultivation for oil production in Tunisia covers from traditional to innovate cropping systems. The aim of the study was to assess the environmental footprint of the most representative olive growing systems of the actual production of olive fruit in Tunisia, from the planting phase to the full production phase, during a reference period of the life cycle of the olive growth of 50 years. Six traditional systems, two intensive systems and one super-intensive system were compared and the differences of type of production (conventional or organic), irrigation management and fertilization management were selected. The impacts associated to olive production were calculated and evaluated by the Life Cycle Assessment methodology and the results of this study were referred to two functional units: 1 ton of olives and 1 ha of cultivated olive growing area. Field agricultural practices of olive systems were soil management, fertilizers, pesticides, pruning and harvesting. The impact categories selected for the environmental analysis were climate change, acidification, freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity. The most innovative olive production systems (intensive and super-intensive) resulted in less environmental impacts for all categories with respect to the rest of systems from the productive perspective but produced higher impacts per hectare of cultivated area. Fertilizers and soil management were the field agricultural practices that presented the highest contributions in most of the categories evaluated. The implementation of an integrated crop management, as well as good practice guides and training programs for farmers, should be considered a priority.

N2  - Agricultural economics Water Programming Models (WPM) has found that irrigators in water scarce areas have a rather inelastic response to water prices, making water pricing cost-ineffective towards water saving. We hypothesize that the predicted water saving performance of pricing is significantly underestimated by issues of model structure, due to the exclusion of deficit irrigation from the set of decision variables available to agents in conventional WPM. To test our hypothesis, we develop a model that integrates a continuous crop-water production function into a positive multi-attribute WPM, which allows us to assess agents’ adaptive responses to pricing through deficit irrigation. The model is illustrated with an application to the El Salobral-Los Llanos irrigated area in Spain. Our results show that incorporating deficit irrigation as an adaptation option makes the water demand curve significantly more elastic as compared to an alternative model setting where deficit irrigation is precluded. We conclude that ignoring deficit irrigation can lead to a significant underestimation of the cost-effectiveness of water pricing towards water saving.

N2  - In this study, a hybrid fuzzy-stochastic programming method is developed
for planning water trading under uncertainties of randomness and
fuzziness. The method can deal with recourse water allocation problems
generated by randomness in water availability and, at the same time,
tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets in the trading system. The
developed method is applied to a water trading program within an
agricultural system in the Zhangweinan River Basin, China. Results can
reflect the decisions for water allocation and crop irrigation under
various flow levels; this allows corrective actions to be taken based on
the predefined policies for cropping patterns and can thus help minimize
the penalty due to water deficit. The results indicate that trading can
release excess water while still keeping the same agricultural revenue
obtained in a non-trading scheme. This implies that trading scheme is
effective for obtaining high economic benefit, particularly for one
water-resources scarcity region. Results also indicate that the
effectiveness of the trading program is explicitly affected by
uncertainties expressed as randomness and fuzziness, which challenges
the users to make decisions of their water demands due to uncertain
water availability. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to analyze
the impacts of trading costs, demonstrating that the trading efforts
could become ineffective when the trading costs are too high. (C) 2013

N2  - Increasing environmental disasters are creating significant uncertainty for farm families and their communities across the world. One site critically affected is the Murray-Darling Basin area of Australia, an area known as the food bowl of Australia. Following a lengthy drought at the turn of the century concerns were raised about water quality and river health. This led successive governments to introduce policies to systematically reduce water available for irrigated agriculture. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was developed by the Commonwealth government and is designed to secure water savings from irrigators and to direct those water savings to the stressed natural environment. This paper focuses on the impact of these changes on irrigation dairy families and their communities in northern Victoria. Using a model designed to test the limits to adaptation, we draw out the constraints, limits and barriers to adaptation for dairy families and their communities coping with reduced water access. This model highlights the types of socially just and fair interventions necessary to assist adaptation and focuses attention on thresholds and traps that may prevent adaptation. The model is relevant to other areas where climate changes and environmental disasters are shaping inevitable change.

N2  - Over abstraction for agricultural production and droughts in the Bakhtegan basin in southwest Iran has led to decreased lake volumes and has even dried in some years. These problems have occurred in the basin as a result of neglecting the roles that humans have played in lake desiccation. This study developed a socio-hydrological model to understand such dynamic interactions between the economy and community's sensitivity to the environment in the period of 1999 to 2013. The WEAP model was used to simulate the hydrological system that is (bi-directionally) coupled to a society model simulating community sensitivity. A multi-objective optimization algorithm was used to estimate the parameters of the coupled model. The results of the model calibration and validation in estimating the simulated discharges show good performance of the model in simulating observed streamflows (R2 and NSE ranging between 0.73 and 0.99 and 0.31 to 0.99 respectively), agriculture water supplied (R2 and NSE ranging between 0.00 and 0.69 and −7.08 to 0.58 respectively), migration and population (R2 and NSE for migration: 0.29 and 0.63). The results of the integrated model on community response showed that attention to environmental conditions, such as lake levels, was heightened right after the drought events of 2000–2001 and 2008–2010. The effect of the latter event was even accentuated by several human interventions such as operationalization of Sivand and Mollasadra dams and transfer of pristine lands to agriculture. This led to major contraction of the lake. The model interprets that heightened community sensitivity as a result led to public policy dialogue and change. Water was taken away from agriculture and given to the environment leading to temporary lake revival. This was also confirmed by reviewing government decisions in 2011, further validating the value of socio-hydrological models in interpreting feedbacks between community sensitivity and environmental flows.

N2  - Biomonitoring programs have developed in the last decades, including the toxicity evaluation of endemic organisms in populations from polluted areas. Environmental bioindicators respond to contaminants as predictors of future damage to their population, ecosystem and human. Amphibian are considered very sensitive contamination bioindicators. Researchers in several continents have conducted ecological studies on the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in anuran tissues, especially in mining and agriculture areas. The Jaguaribe River is an important water source in northeastern Brazil, home of agriculture irrigated perimeters; but it also concerns users for increasing the risks of environmental contamination. The objective of this work was to quantify potentially toxic elements in Leptodactylus macrosternum carcasses, evaluating its potential as a contamination bioindicator of agrosystem areas in the Lower Jaguaribe River basin, Ceará, northeastern Brazil. The elements As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were detected in the L. macrosternum carcasses' samples. There was no significant difference in the concentrations of detected metals by area status; however, analysis of variance suggested that individuals had more constant exposure to Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb in cultivated area status. The cluster analysis of chemicals indicated two optimal element groups, which proposed different compounds from diverse origins. Body index significantly influenced Mn and Pb, while sex influenced Fe and Pb accumulation. The results suggested that the L. macrosternum species is a conceivable local bioindicator for environmental potentially toxic elements. However, other tissues will be tested to improve their sensitivity and validate their capacity to be employed as a biomonitoring tool.

N2  - Theoretically, the relationship between shocks and agricultural innovation adoption could be ambiguous. While shocks could lower the competence and capacity of households to adopt new agricultural innovations, households can also take-up agricultural innovations as a coping mechanism against the different shocks they face. Using a nationally representative household data from Ethiopia of the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) of the World Bank, this paper analyzes the effect of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks on adoption of different agricultural innovations, assuming interdependence among the innovations. We find shocks to have heterogeneous effects on the adoption of agricultural innovations. Specifically, production and health shocks have negative effects on the adoption of high-cost innovations such as improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, and irrigation. However, production shocks are positively associated with low-cost innovations such as organic fertilizer. To enhance farmers’ adoption of agricultural innovations, especially high-cost innovations, there is a greater need towards the design of policies and interventions that would reduce household's exposure to production and health shocks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N1  - Managing Rainwater and Small Reservoirs in Sub-Saharan Africa
N2  - From field to basin scales, there are many appropriate interventions used to manage rainfall efficiently and productively in smallholder farming systems. Yet, successful targeting and scaling-out of these approaches remains a challenge. This paper presents an innovative approach in decision support called ‘Targeting Agricultural Water Management Interventions’ (TAGMI) with application in Limpopo and Volta river basins (available at http://www.seimapping.org/tagmi/). The online open-access TAGMI uses country-scale Bayesian network models to assess the likelihood of success for outscaling various agricultural water management (AWM) interventions at sub-national level. The web tool integrates multiple sources of expertise on the enabling environment for outscaling based on key social, human, physical, financial, and natural factors. It estimates the relative probability of success of an AWM intervention across the Limpopo and Volta river basins. Here we present TAGMI as a ‘proof of concept’, areas of high, medium, and low probabilities of success for three AWM technologies common in Limpopo and Volta River Basins: the soil water conservation/in situ rainwater harvesting technologies in rain-fed systems, small-scale private irrigation and small reservoirs used for communal irrigation purposes. We then apply a climate change scenario and discuss the robustness in potential AWM, according to the TAGMI tool. Finally, we discuss the need for generic or specific information on ‘best practices of implementation’ for successful uptake of technologies in poverty-constrained smallholder farming systems.

N2  - Understanding the nature of soil infiltration properties is important
for a number of applications, including planning efficient irrigation
and erosion control practices, evaluating effectiveness of linings for
sanitary landfills and waste lagoons, and landscape design and
management. A common method for measuring infiltration is with the use
of cylinder infiltrometers. This method can be very labor intensive and
time-consuming, thus limiting its practicality. We describe the
construction of an inexpensive system that can be readily adapted to
single- and dual-ring infiltrometers to provide automated measurements
on the scale of seconds to days. The system is comprised of an infrared
distance-measuring sensor and microcontroller that can be programmed to
collect water level measurements at various time intervals. Data are
logged by the system in the field and can be downloaded for processing
and analysis. This system is not only inexpensive, but also small,
lightweight and versatile, and can be readily adapted to collect
additional parameters. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - In recent years, agricultural non-point source pollution (ANPSP) has become the biggest threat to Aras River water quality by completing the Mughan irrigation and drainage network. Nutrient pollutants, including nitrate and phosphate, released into the river through drains have created a range of obstacles for locals living around the river. Agricultural activities are generally considered the largest source of non-point pollution. They have no complex and uniform impact along the river. Thus, the spatial distribution of ANPS and highly polluted areas should be identified to manage watershed management. This study proposes a simple framework for identifying pollutant-sensitive areas along the river and management strategies to improve water quality. To this aim, the main factors affecting ANPSP were identified, and the effectiveness of the scenarios selected to comply with water quality regulations for drinking and environment during 1993–2007 were simulated. Based on the sensitivity analysis, land use and fertilizer are the main factors affecting river ANPSP. Thus, their changes were modeled in different scenarios. Based on the results, the ANPSP load was higher downstream. The agricultural lands in region 3 were considered the main source of pollution. Comparing the management scenarios showed that the amount of nitrate and phosphate leaching into the river decreased to 18.1 and 8.35 %, respectively, by reducing the consumption of urea and phosphate fertilizers by 50 %. The results help watershed managers implement eco-friendly land use and nutrient management programs at specific locations during specific periods to control ANPSP along the rivers.

N2  - The accurate understanding of the human-modified water cycle calls for a detailed representation of human and water systems, including relevant non-linearities, and of the feedback responses between them. This paper couples a microeconomic Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming model with a Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) with the objective of incorporating the behavior and adaptive responses of human agents into the representation of the human-modified water cycle. The coupling occurs in a sequential fashion using bidirectional protocols that represent the feedback responses between the microeconomic and hydrologic modules through common spatial elements and variables. The proposed model is illustrated with an application to agricultural water management in the Upper Tagus River Basin in Spain. The non-linear responses observed in the modeled human-water system suggest that strengthening the agricultural water allocation constraint can avert or delay drought negative environmental impacts with a less-than-proportional yet incremental impact on Gross Value Added and employment.

N2  - Bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas euvesicatoria is one of the most devastating pepper diseases in Serbia. Questionable seed quality, climatic conditions, and frequent irrigation during summer favour the disease occurrence and spread. The available management practices do not provide adequate disease control. Therefore, development of alternative and more sustainable disease management strategies is needed. Integration of classical and biological treatments could be an effective, environmentally safe option for reducing pepper bacterial spot severity. In order to develop an efficient integrated disease management program, we studied efficacy of biocontrol agents (bacteriophage strain KФ1 and two strains of Bacillus subtilis AAac and QST 713), systemic acquired resistance (SAR) inducer (acibenzolar-S-methyl - ASM), a commercial microbial fertilizer (Slavol), copper based compounds (copper hydroxide and copper oxychloride) in combination with or without mancozeb, and antibiotics (streptomycin sulphate and kasugamycin). They were applied as single treatments in two separate field experiments. Based on the single treatment efficacy, various combinations of the treatments were chosen for further testing in three separate field experiments. Additionally, we evaluated potential negative effect of ASM on pepper growth and yield in the growth chamber experiment. All the tested single treatments significantly reduced disease severity compared to the inoculated control (IC), except microbiological fertilizer and the antagonistic strain AAac. Integration of copper hydroxide, ASM and bacteriophages was the most efficient treatment, reducing the disease intensity by 96–98%. The results indicated that this combination may be an adequate alternative program for control of pepper bacterial spot.

N2  - Decentralized aquifer recharge programs are an alternative to centralized stormwater aquifer recharge systems and can improve groundwater tables in urban areas. In a decentralized aquifer recharge program, households and property-owners collect and store rainwater from rooftops and replenish aquifers through small gravity-fed recharge wells. This research presents a micro-trading rainwater for aquifer recharge (MRAR) system as a decentralized peer-to-peer water market that can recharge groundwater resources. Through a decentralized water market, households act as prosumers who collect and sell rainwater to consumer households and convey traded water via a shared aquifer. This research develops an agent-based modeling framework as an approach to evaluate the performance of a MRAR system to replenish groundwater resources and reduce energy required to pump water. Agents represent (1) prosumers that collect rainwater, sell rainwater to consumers, and replenish the groundwater system through dry wells, and (2) consumers that exert irrigation demands, buy rainwater from prosumers, and pump water from the groundwater system. The agent-based model is coupled with a groundwater flow model to evaluate the effects of micro-trading on groundwater resources. The agent-based modeling framework is applied for a virtual city to assess the performance of a MRAR system for scenarios that vary in the ratio of consumers to prosumers, location of prosumers and consumers, and aquifer properties. Model outcomes demonstrate the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers based on the volume of traded water, improvements in groundwater head, and improvements in unit energy of water. Findings demonstrate that the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers is consistent across different values for hydraulic conductivity. The location of prosumer and consumer households affects the unit energy of water and has a negligible effect on the groundwater table and total energy consumed to pump water. This manuscript proposes and demonstrates MRAR as a new decentralized water system and provides a modeling approach to assess the performance of a MRAR system to improve urban groundwater resources.

N2  - Crop diversity (e.g. the number of agricultural crop types and the level of evenness in area distribution) in the agricultural systems of arid Central Asia has recently been increased mainly to achieve food security of the rural population, however, not throughout the irrigation system. Site-specific factors that promote or hamper crop diversification after the dissolvent of the Soviet Union have hardly been assessed yet. While tapping the potential of remote sensing, the objective was to map and explain spatial patterns of current crop diversity by the example of the irrigated agricultural landscapes of the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Multi-temporal Landsat and RapidEye satellite data formed the basis for creating annual and multi-annual crop maps for 2010–2012 while using supervised classifications. Applying the Simpson index of diversity (SID) to circular buffers with radii of 1.5 and 5 km elucidated the spatial distribution of crop diversity at both the local and landscape spatial scales. A variable importance analysis, rooted in the conditional forest algorithm, investigated potential environmental and socio-economic drivers of the spatial patterns of crop diversity. Overall accuracy of the annual crop maps ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 whilst the SID varied between 0.1 and 0.85. The findings confirmed the existence of areas under monocultures as well as of crop diverse patches. Higher crop diversity occurred in the more distal parts of the irrigation system and sparsely settled areas, especially due to orchards. In contrast, in water-secure and densely settled areas, cotton-wheat rotations dominated due to the state interventions in crop cultivation. Distances to irrigation infrastructure, settlements and the road network influenced crop diversity the most. Spatial explicit information on crop diversity per se has the potential to support policymaking and spatial planning towards crop diversification. Driver analysis as exemplified at the study region in Uzbekistan can help reaching the declared policy to increase crop diversity throughout the country and even beyond.

N1  - Irrigation efficiency and productivity: scales, systems and science
N2  - Recent research suggests that regional hydrologic and economic implications should be considered before adopting policies encouraging efficient irrigation technology. Investigating regional effects of irrigation efficiency investments relies on predicting how farmers will adopt irrigation technology and practices in response to different water management policies. Under water rationing, price changes, subsidies and other policies, farmers will typically trade-off water use with irrigation efficiency investment in order to maximize profits. We employ a self-calibrating profit maximizing model of agricultural production based on the existing California Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP). The model embeds irrigation efficiency vs. capital investment trade-offs for different crops to predict production, water use, irrigation investments, yields and water productivity under different water management policies. Calibration to observed cultivated areas and water application for different crops is performed using the positive mathematical programming (PMP) method. The trade-off between irrigation efficiency and capital investment is modeled as a nested constant elasticity of substitution constraint that allows substitution between irrigation investment and total applied water. The model is applied to the Tulare Basin in California's southern Central Valley. Policy simulations include an increase in water price, water rationing, and rationing and irrigation efficiency subsidies. Our results show subsidizing efficient irrigation technology may have a little effect on total land and water use and so may not promote water conservation without other incentives or regulations. Of the three policies simulated, a water price increase of 20% is found to be the most conducive to gains in agricultural water productivity (43% gain).

N2  - Climate change poses significant challenges to agriculture, with serious impacts on smallholder farmers’ food security and livelihoods. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to facilitate climate change adaptation and mitigation. While there is evidence that CSA supports smallholders’ adaption to climate change, the rate of CSA adoption remains low, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies have explained the low adoption based on generic factors such as farm, farmer, institutional and location characteristics, yet little is known about the role of farmers’ cognitive traits. This study investigates the influence of farmer entrepreneurial orientation, a cognitive trait reflecting a farmer’s innovativeness, proactiveness and propensity to take risks. We use data from smallholder potato farmers in Kenya and estimate a set of multivariate probit models to analyse the adoption decisions. Results show that risk-taking positively influences the adoption of irrigation, changing cultivation calendar, use of certified seed, crop rotation and soil testing. Proactiveness is positively related to the use of irrigation, changing the cultivation calendar and use of certified seed, while it is negatively related to intercropping. Contrary to our hypothesis that innovative farmers are more likely to adopt CSA practices, we find a negative relation between innovativeness and the use of certified seed. After categorizing CSA practices based on the main resources required, we find that risk-taking is positively associated with the adoption of practices that require high intensity of skilled labour and financial resources. Innovativeness is negatively associated with practices that require high intensity of financial resources. Lastly, we find proactiveness to be positively associated with the adoption of finance-intensive practices but negatively associated with unskilled-labour-intensive practices. These findings imply, first, that development practitioners should consider the interrelations among CSA practices and farmer entrepreneurial orientation in designing development interventions. Second, policy-makers need to create an environment conducive to farmer entrepreneurship as an indirect way to support the adoption of appropriate CSA practices.

N2  - The present study has been carried out to assess the factors controlling the hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater quality in a part of Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, India. For this purpose total 68 groundwater samples were collected from pre- and post- monsoon season corresponding to June and November 2013 and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, total dissolved solids and major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) and anions (HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, NO3−, F−). Groundwater of the area is slightly alkaline in nature. Major groundwater facies identified are ‘Ca + Mg-HCO3’ and ‘Na + K-HCO3’ during both sampling seasons. The PHREEQC geochemical modeling program was used to evaluate the saturation state of minerals and its dissolution/precipitation reactions occurring in groundwater. The computed saturation indices demonstrate oversaturated condition with respect to dolomite and calcite and undersaturated condition with gypsum, halite and fluorite. Drinking and agriculture quality of groundwater samples were also assessed. Parameters such as total dissolved solids, Na+, K+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, F− exceed the desirable limits of drinking water standards as prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards and Word Health Organization in few samples. Agricultural water quality is assessed by using various indices such as sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, and permeability index. Excess value of these indices at some sites restrict its suitability for irrigation purpose. Therefore, groundwater management plan is required to improve the water quality in the area.

N2  - This paper proposes a modeling approach for assessing changes in groundwater pollution hazard under two different socio-economic and environmental scenarios: The first one considers an exponential growth of agriculture land-use (Relegated Sustainability), while the other deals with regional economic growth, taking into account, the restrictions put on natural resources use (Sustainability Reforms). The recent (2011) and forecasted (2030) groundwater pollution hazard is evaluated based on hydrogeological parameters and, the impact of land-use changes in the groundwater system, coupling together a land-use change model (Dyna-CLUE) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW), as inputs to a decision system support (EMDS). The Dulce Stream Watershed (Pampa Plain, Argentina) was chosen to test the usefulness and utility of this proposed method. It includes a high level of agricultural activities, significant local extraction of groundwater resources for drinking water and irrigation and extensive available data regarding aquifer features. The Relegated Sustainability Scenario showed a negative change in the aquifer system, increasing (+20%; high–very high classes) the contribution to groundwater pollution hazard throughout the watershed. On the other hand, the Sustainability Reforms Scenario displayed more balanced land-use changes with a trend towards sustainability, therefore proposing a more acceptable change in the aquifer system for 2030 with a possible 2% increase (high–very high classes) in groundwater pollution hazard. Results in the recent scenario (2011) showed that 54% of Dulce Stream Watershed still shows a moderate to a very low contribution to groundwater pollution hazard (mainly in the lower area). Therefore, from the point of view of natural resource management, this is a positive aspect, offering possibilities for intervention in order to prevent deterioration and protect this aquifer system. However, since it is quite possible that this aquifer status (i.e. groundwater quality) changes in the near future, the implementation of planning measures and natural resource management is recommended.

N2  - With the likelihood of future changes in climate and climate variability, it is important to understand how human systems may be vulnerable. Rural communities in Saskatchewan having agricultural-based economies are particularly dependent on climate and could be among the most vulnerable human systems in Canada. Future changes in climate are likely to have significant impacts on rural livelihoods, and rural populations will face the challenge of coping with climate change in light of a multitude of other changing socio-economic and environmental conditions. The Rural Municipality of Rudy No. 284 was chosen as a case study due to its access to irrigation, a key tool in climate adaptation for the agricultural system in the area against one of its most notorious climatic features – severe multi-year droughts. Further irrigation development would continue to reduce climate vulnerabilities. Even with irrigation however, the compounding effects of climate and other socio-economic changes will likely require modifications in current practices and policies in order to secure adequate livelihoods. Climate change adaptation in the RM must ensure equitable access to water and potentially irrigation, reduce barriers to collaboration when addressing communal problems, and provide more certainty in government programs.

N2  - This paper focuses on the economic consequences of droughts for the irrigation sector. We develop a dynamic-recursive mathematical programming farm model that assumes imperfect mobility of capital and labour as well as rational expectations about future water availability. The model is calibrated to 12 representative farms belonging to three irrigation communities of the Guadalquivir Basin (south Spain) and used to simulate the 1991-1997 period, which included 3 years of intense drought. Results indicate that the drought imposed significant costs on farmers, but show also that water managers partly exacerbated these costs by allocating excessive amounts of water to irrigators in the abundant years. The model is also used to evaluate the benefits of a perfect water supply forecast and to simulate the economic gains of a voluntary water banking scheme. Results show that the benefits resulting from the perfect forecast of water supply 1 year ahead would represent a relative gain of 5%. However, a voluntary banking system would allow farmers to increase their benefits by 32-82% depending on the supply system. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Summary
The quantity and quality of available water resources have been recognized as limiting factors in development of most of the arid and semi arid regions. Optimal use of available surface and groundwater, in any canal command area would result in their better utilization by maximizing the benefits from the crop production. Shortages of surface water supplies have increased the need of groundwater development in many canal commands. The potential of groundwater can be used to develop conjunctive use water management plans for supplementing canal water supplies and to increase agricultural productivity. In the present paper, the feasibility of conjunctive use management is analyzed using a mathematical model in the Sapon irrigation command area of Kulon Progo Regency, Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. The water demand and available water resources in the study area are evaluated considering surface water and groundwater. In the present paper, a simple economic-engineering optimization model is presented to explore the possibilities of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater using linear programming with various hydrological and management constraints, and to arrive at an optimal cropping pattern for optimal use of water resources for maximization of net benefits. The LINDO 6.1, optimization package has been used to arrive at optimal allocation plan of surface water and groundwater. The results indicate that conjunctive use options are feasible and can be easily implemented in the area, which would enhance the overall benefits from cropping activities.

N2  - Kansai river basin is a semiarid and hard rock landscape. While water scarcity is a serious concern in this area, irrigation is carried out in many portions of the region, mostly using surface and groundwater. The proper water management plan is essential in this area to ensure that water is used efficiently and effectively without creating excessive exploitation and waste. For the 40 samples obtained, several physicochemical parameters were assessed in the field and in the laboratory. Ca+2 > Na+ > Mg+2 > K+ and HCO3¯ > Cl¯ > SO4¯ are the decreasing order of occurrences of cations and anions in the groundwater of the research region, respectively. According to the piper plot, the water facies prevailing in this region is 82.5% Ca–Mg–SO4 type and the rest 17.5% is Ca–Mg–HCO3 type. The multicriteria decision analysis and a geographic information system were used to create groundwater suitability zones for irrigation (GIS). The analytic hierarchy process weighted analysis technique was used to create the final zonation map, which included nine irrigational water factors. According to the zonation map, highly and poor suitable zones make up 41.18% and 11.19% of the research region, respectively. The results from this study would help the decision-makers in the coming future for making water and environment management programs.

N2  - Processing tomato is a widespread crop in the Mediterranean area where often there are problems of high salinity of irrigation water with considerable harmful effects on yield. Pyraclostrobin is a strobilurin based fungicide (PBF) having a broad range of applications. Strobilurins are reported to have biostimulant effect on plant mitigating abiotic stress. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the ability of PBF to improve gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll, activity of antioxidative enzymes as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), yield characteristics, and water use efficiency (WUE) of tomato under salinity. A two-year research was carried out in Southern Italy, on tomato cv Coronel grown in pots under plastic greenhouse, to compare two soil salinity levels (electrical conductivity, ECe = 1.1 and 5.4 dS m−1) in combination with or without PBF. As expected, salinity had harmful effects on physiological and biochemical parameters of tomato that in turn affected yield and WUE, but improved fruit quality. In fact, salinity reduced fruit mean weight (19.0%) and yield (21.4%), and increased fruit blossom-end rot (55.7%), total soluble solids (18.2%) and dry matter (18.5%) content. Overall, PBF increased leaf chlorophyll content (6.1%) and the activity of SOD, POD, CAT and APX, mainly under salinity. Moreover, it reduced stomatal conductance (12.5%) and transpiration (11.7%), but improved assimilation rate (7.8%) and intrinsic WUE (23.3%), that in turn increased yield (8.1%) and yield WUE (6.5%). The improvement in yield produced by PBF was highest in salt stressed plants. In view of the positive effects of PBF, its use should be promoted in defence programs of tomato crop, above all in areas with salinity problems.

N2  - Climate change is a significant obstacle for farmers in the least developed countries like Afghanistan and adaptation support is exceptionally scarce. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers' adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers' access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers' self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan.

N1  - Integrative modelling for sustainable water allocation
N2  - The paper presents a decision support designed to conduct an economic-environmental assessment of the agricultural activity focusing on irrigation called ‘Decision Support for IRRigated Agriculture’ (DSIRR). The program describes the effect at catchment scale of choices taken at micro scale by independent actors, the farmers, by simulating their decision process. The decision support (DS) has been thought of as a support tool for participatory water policies as requested by the Water Framework Directive and it aims at analyzing alternatives in production and technology, according to different market, policy and climate conditions. The tool uses data and models, provides a graphical user interface and can incorporate the decision makers' own insights. Heterogeneity in preferences is admitted since it is assumed that irrigators try to optimize personal multi-attribute utility functions, subject to a set of constraints. Consideration of agronomic and engineering aspects allows an accurate description of irrigation. Mathematical programming techniques are applied to find solutions. The program has been applied in the river Po basin (northern Italy) to analyze the impact of a pricing policy in a context of irrigation technology innovation. Water demand functions and elasticity to water price have been estimated. Results demonstrate how different areas and systems react to the same policy in quite a different way. While in the annual cropping system pricing seems effective to save the resource at the cost of impeding Water Agencies cost recovery, the same policy has an opposite effect in the perennial fruit system which shows an inelastic response to water price. The multidimensional assessment conducted clarified the trades-off among conflicting economic-social-environmental objectives, thus generating valuable information to design a more tailored mix of measures.

N2  - Evapotranspiration-based irrigation controllers, also known as ET controllers, use ET information or estimation to schedule irrigation. Previous research has shown that ET controllers could reduce irrigation as much as 42% when compared to a time-based irrigation schedule. The objective of this study was to determine the capability of three brands of ET-based irrigation controllers to schedule irrigation compared to a theoretically derived soil water balance model based on the Irrigation Association Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) protocol to determine the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling. Five treatments were established, T1–T5, replicated four times for a total of twenty field plots in a completely randomized block design. The irrigation treatments were as follows: T1, Weathermatic SL1600 with SLW15 weather monitor; T2, Toro Intelli-sense; T3, ETwater Smart Controller 100; T4, a time-based treatment determined by local recommendations; and T5, a reduced time-based treatment 60% of T4. All treatments utilized rain sensors set at a 6mm threshold. A daily soil water balance model was used to calculate the theoretical irrigation requirements for comparison with actual irrigation water applied. Calculated in 30-day running totals, irrigation adequacy and scheduling efficiency were used to quantify under- and over-irrigation, respectively. The study period, 25 May 2006 through 27 November 2007, was drier than the historical average with a total of 1326mm of rainfall compared to 1979mm for the same historical period. It was found that all treatments applied less irrigation than required for all seasons. Additionally, the ET controllers applied only half of the irrigation calculated for the theoretical requirement for each irrigation event, on average. Irrigation adequacy decreased when the ET controllers were allowed to irrigate any day of the week. All treatments had decreased scheduling efficiency averages in the rainy season with the largest decrease of 29 percentile points with a timer and rain sensor (T4) and an average decrease of 20 percentile points for the ET controllers, indicating that site specific rainfall has a significant effect on scheduling efficiency results. Rainfall did not drastically impact the average irrigation adequacy results. For this study, there were two controller program settings that impacted the results. The first setting was the crop coefficients where specific values were chosen for the location of the study when calculating the theoretical requirement whereas the controllers used default values. The second setting was the soil type that defines the soil water holding capacity of the soil. The ET controllers were able to regularly adjust to real-time weather, unlike the conventional irrigation timers. However, the incorporation of site specific rainfall measurements is extremely important to their success at managing landscape water needs and at a minimum a rain sensor should be used.

N2  - The development of composite culture of carps in Purulia, an economically underdeveloped district of India, is confronted with several socio-economic, topographic, and climatic challenges. West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project (WBADMIP), an innovative integrated program of irrigation, agriculture, horticulture, and fisheries interventions through community institutions, was implemented in Purulia by the Government of West Bengal and was supported by the World Bank. Performances of the composite culture of carps in 172 water bodies by fisheries interest groups under the initiatives of WBADMIP were evaluated based on 18 different parameters using the k-mean algorithm. The results indicated that the water bodies could be categorized into three Clusters, based on inputs, expenditure, production, and income. Cluster 1, consisting of 85 water bodies, exhibited moderate performance with an average production of 2351 kg/ha, followed by Cluster 2 of 49 water bodies exhibiting poor performance with an average production of 1463 kg/ha, and Cluster 3 of 38 water bodies exhibiting best performance with an average production of 2488 kg/ha. Euclidean distance between Cluster centers 1 and 2 was 4.511 as compared to 3.737 and 5.102 between the Cluster centers 1 and 3 and 2 and 3, respectively. The water bodies with higher productivity were primarily associated with the WBADMIP policy that mobilized trained farmers who could adequately manage the application of feed, lime, inorganic fertilizers, and organic fertilizers. Using decision tree analysis, we predicted that the maintenance of water pH above 6.9 is crucial in obtaining optimum carps production from these water bodies. In contrast, the use of lime, inorganic fertilizers, organic fertilizers, and an adequate amount of feed need to be adjusted to maintain an economically viable production system. It is concluded that the farmers' motivation and professional training along with project support can substantially improve the productivity of the water bodies, support the nutrition of the farmers' community, and boost the local economy.

N2  - A key guideline of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) asks to cover water costs in a way to encourage the efficient use of the resource, therefore its protection, but minimizing possible adverse environmental, social and economic impacts of cost recovery. We use a Mathematical Programming model of an Italian, Mediterranean agricultural area where a Reclamation and Irrigation Board (RIB) manages collective irrigation facilities, to simulate the impact of replacing the existing pricing system with several alternatives, at different degrees of water cost recovery. We estimate the water distribution cost (WDC) of the RIB with a Translog cost function, and consider the cost incurred by the Sardinian water agency (ENAS) for maintaining regional dams and primary water infrastructures. We also consider that a Regional subsidy pays part of the RIBs and ENAS energy cost for water lifting, and that ENAS rates are modulated among end-users to reduce agricultural fee by increasing the charge on industrial uses. We simulate the impact of alternative pricing under four scenarios of cost recovery: (i) current partial recovery of WDC, with no ENAS charge; (ii) current recovery of WDC, plus ENAS cost at modulated agricultural rates; (iii) full coverage of WDC, i.e. absence of the Regional aid, plus ENAS cost at modulated agricultural rates; (iv) full coverage of WDC, plus unmodulated ENAS rate. Solely changing the water pricing system, at current cost recovery level, generates limited total impacts, but substantial income redistributive effects among farm types whose magnitude grows increasing the level of recovery. The full cost recovery scenarios generate remarkable global impacts and drops of income in the single farm types, particularly when applying ENAS undiscounted rate. Major consequences also emerge for the use of water and other productive factors, and labour employment.

N2  - In recent decades, the Kou watershed in south-western Burkina Faso has suffered from poor water management. Despite the abundance of water, most water users regularly face water shortages because of the increase in the amount of land under irrigation. To help them achieve a more equitable allocation of irrigated land, local stakeholders need an easily managed low-cost tool for monitoring and mapping these irrigated zones. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and low-cost procedure for mosaicing and geo referencing amateur small-scale aerial photographs for land-use surveys. Sets of tens (2009) and hundreds (2007) of low-altitude aerial photographs, with a resolution of 0.4m and 0.8m, respectively, were used to create a detailed land-cover map of typical African small-scale irrigated agriculture. A commercially available stitching tool and GIS allowed geo referenced 'mono-images’ to be constructed; both mosaics were warped on a high-resolution SPOT image with a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of about 11m. The RMSE between the two image datasets was 2m. This approach is less sensitive to atmospheric conditions that are non-predictable in programming satellite imagery.

N2  - Nitrate leaching is one of the many forms of environmental pollution
resulting from irrigation and intensive agriculture. In this work, a
method of combining an agronomic simulation model (EPIC) and a
mathematical multi-objective programming model is used to analyse the
effects of three agricultural policies on farmer's revenue and nitrate
leaching. An evaluation of the net social costs associated with the
different policy measures is also given. The farmer's behaviour in
different policy scenarios was studied in terms of selected crops,
irrigation technique and method, and adopted management practices with
focus on farm management practices and water application efficiency.
Irrigation water pricing, subsidies to adopt improved management levels,
and taxation on the use of nitrogen fertilizer were examined. A
trade-off emerges between the levels of nitrate leaching and net
farmer's revenue more pronounced for nitrogen tax policies than for
water pricing. The results obtained indicate that nitrate leaching can
be reduced by about 40% with an associated net social cost of 269
epsilon/ha for the water pricing policy, 183 epsilon/ha for the tax on
fertilizer and 95 epsilon/ha for subsidies to high efficiency
management. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Soil bulk density (BD) is very important factor in land drainage and reclamation, irrigation scheduling (for estimating the soil volumetric water content), and assessing soil carbon and nutrient stock as well as determining the pollutant mass balance in soils. Numerous pedotransfer functions have been suggested so far to relate the soil BD values to soil parameters (e.g. soil separates, carbon content, etc). The present paper aims at simulating soil BD using easily measured soil variables through heuristic gene expression programming (GEP), neural networks (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression trees (BT) techniques. The statistical Gamma test was utilized to identify the most influential soil parameters on BD. The applied models were assessed through k-fold testing where all the available data patterns were involved in the both training and testing stages, which provide an accurate assessment of the models accuracy. Some existing pedotransfer functions were also applied and compared with the heuristic models. The obtained results revealed that the heuristic GEP model outperformed the other applied models globally and per test stage. Nevertheless, the performance accuracy of the applied heuristic models was much better than those of the applied pedotransfer functions. Using k-fold testing provides a more-in-detail judgment of the models.

N2  - Relatively few studies have addressed water management and adaptation measures in the face of changing water balances due to climate change. The current work studies climate change impact on a multipurpose reservoir performance and derives adaptive policies for possible future scenarios. The method developed in this work is illustrated with a case study of Hirakud reservoir on the Mahanadi river in Orissa, India, which is a multipurpose reservoir serving flood control, irrigation and power generation. Climate change effects on annual hydropower generation and four performance indices (reliability with respect to three reservoir functions, viz. hydropower, irrigation and flood control, resiliency, vulnerability and deficit ratio with respect to hydropower) are studied. Outputs from three general circulation models (GCMs) for three scenarios each are downscaled to monsoon streamflow in the Mahanadi river for two future time slices, 2045–65 and 2075–95. Increased irrigation demands, rule curves dictated by increased need for flood storage and downscaled projections of streamflow from the ensemble of GCMs and scenarios are used for projecting future hydrologic scenarios. It is seen that hydropower generation and reliability with respect to hydropower and irrigation are likely to show a decrease in future in most scenarios, whereas the deficit ratio and vulnerability are likely to increase as a result of climate change if the standard operating policy (SOP) using current rule curves for flood protection is employed. An optimal monthly operating policy is then derived using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) as an adaptive policy for mitigating impacts of climate change on reservoir operation. The objective of this policy is to maximize reliabilities with respect to multiple reservoir functions of hydropower, irrigation and flood control. In variations to this adaptive policy, increasingly more weightage is given to the purpose of maximizing reliability with respect to hydropower for two extreme scenarios. It is seen that by marginally sacrificing reliability with respect to irrigation and flood control, hydropower reliability and generation can be increased for future scenarios. This suggests that reservoir rules for flood control may have to be revised in basins where climate change projects an increasing probability of droughts. However, it is also seen that power generation is unable to be restored to current levels, due in part to the large projected increases in irrigation demand. This suggests that future water balance deficits may limit the success of adaptive policy options.

N2  - There is a timely need to evaluate the effect agricultural factors and meteorological conditions on fresh produce contamination. This study evaluated those risk factors and described, for the first time, the distribution of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, coliforms, and Enterobacteriaceae) and the prevalence of foodborne pathogens (Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) in baby spinach grown in the Southeast of Spain. A longitudinal study was conducted on three farms (2011–2013). Results obtained for E. coli highlighted soil and irrigation water as important factors affecting the microbial safety of baby spinach. Significant differences in the proportion of E. coli positive samples were found between treated (46.1%) and untreated (100%) irrigation water. However, the microbial quality of irrigation water didn't affect E. coli prevalence in produce. All E. coli positive spinach samples were detected at the highest observed temperature range suggesting that ambient temperature affects the probability and extent of spinach contamination. Salmonella spp. was detected by RT-PCR in manure, soil, irrigation water and baby spinach but only two of them (manure and irrigation water) were confirmed by isolation in culture media. Salmonella RT-PCR positive samples showed higher levels of E. coli than Salmonella negative samples. This preliminary finding supports recent identification of E. coli as a suitable parameter for the hygiene criterion at the primary production of leafy greens.

N2  - A growing population and an increased demand for water resources have resulted in a global trend of groundwater depletion. Arid and semi-arid climates are particularly susceptible, often relying on groundwater to support large population centers or irrigated agriculture in the absence of sufficient surface water resources. In an effort to increase the security of groundwater resources, managed aquifer recharge (MAR) programs have been developed and implemented globally. MAR is the approach of intentionally harvesting and infiltrating water to recharge depleted aquifer storage. California is a prime example of this growing problem, with three cities that have over a million residents and an agricultural industry that was valued at 47billion dollars in 2015. The present-day groundwater overdraft of over 100km3 (since 1962) indicates a clear disparity between surface water supply and water demand within the state. In the face of groundwater overdraft and the anticipated effects of climate change, many new MAR projects are being constructed or investigated throughout California, adding to those that have existed for decades. Some common MAR types utilized in California include injection wells, infiltration basins (also known as spreading basins, percolation basins, or recharge basins), and low-impact development. An emerging MAR type that is actively being investigated is the winter flooding of agricultural fields using existing irrigation infrastructure and excess surface water resources, known as agricultural MAR. California therefore provides an excellent case study to look at the historical use and performance of MAR, ongoing and emerging challenges, novel MAR applications, and the potential for expansion of MAR. Effective MAR projects are an essential tool for increasing groundwater security, both in California and on a global scale. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the most common MAR types and applications within the State of California and neighboring semi-arid regions.

N2  - Ibrahemia canal is one of the longest irrigation canals in Egypt. It starts at 400m upstream of Asuit barrages and ends in Giza Irrigation General Directorate of 316.300km length. The canal cross section is bounded in many reaches along canal length by railway line in right bank and Cairo-Aswan agriculture road in left bank. The canal passes through many cities and residential areas, its cross section is affected negatively due to interpenetrate with road section and railway lines. Wastes and deposits increase the contraction of canal cross section. The reach from km 122 to km 132 which located within El Menya City is one of the most critical reaches owing to its length, complicity of maintenance and its effect on canal water hydraulic gradient. The objective of the study is to introduce the most convenient maintenance program to improve the hydraulic efficiency of the studied reach and reduce the loss in water levels along it, also to insure that the reach is capable of passing the required discharge to downstream reaches. The canal cross sections were surveyed along the study reach, the flow velocities were measured and flow discharge was calculated. The study reach was simulated using one dimension mathematical model (SOBEK 1D) to predict the change of hydraulic parameters of the study reach after the execution of the suggested training programs. Finally four maintenance scenarios were suggested and evaluated hydraulically to improve the hydraulic efficiency of the selected reach of Ibrahemia canal.

N2  - Four hard red bread wheat cultivars with the same high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition (1Ax1, 1Bx13, 1By16, 1Dx5 and 1Dy10), developed for each of two production regions (irrigation and dryland) in South Africa, were tested at two representative locations of each region for two consecutive seasons to determine how different genetic backgrounds, locations and seasons influenced the quantity of the HMW-GS expressed, and how this affected baking quality characteristics. Location contributed the most to the observed variation in the bread making quality characteristics. In the irrigation region, subunit 1Ax1 was correlated significantly to most quality traits, especially flour protein and wet gluten content. In the dryland region, significant positive correlations for similar characteristics were expressed by subunit 1Dx5, showing that the influence of these subunits were not constant across the localities. This also highlighted the importance of the x-type subunits in the bread wheat quality breeding programs of South Africa.

N2  - Africa’s river basin systems are in peril. Under pressure of an every-increasing population and related demand for water and land for cultivation and other uses of river basins, Africa’s water resources are under high stress. Climate change-related impacts further aggravate this situation, manifesting in reduced rainfall, and more frequent occurrence of extreme events, including frequent droughts. As often, under such precarious conditions, overexploitation of resources has been the response of both authorities and communities to such changing environments. The two case studies presented in this chapter, the Senegal River in Senegal and the Pangani River in Tanzania, are examples of the many river systems in Africa that have been heavily affected by both human interventions, such as dams and large-scale irrigation schemes, as well as climate change. The negative implications of such interventions, in particular on the vulnerable estuarine environments and their dependent population, are often not well conceived from the onset. Based on the two case studies, this chapter reflects in particular on the interventions taken by Government, as well as the adaptive responses by communities confronted with changes in the river system. The chapter will argue in this regard, that it is only through an integrated system-wide approach that appropriate strategies can be developed to secure the long-term ecological future of Africa’s river systems.

N2  - Agricultural training is a potentially effective method to diffuse relevant new technologies to increase productivity and alleviate rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers’ technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the conventional farmer training approach.

N2  - In addition to the commonly known use as an alternative source for natural rubber and hypoallergenic latex, guayule could also be a source of resin and bagasse for use in the pharmaceutical and biofuel industries. Pyrolysis is a method to convert guayule biomass into liquid (condensable gas or bio-oil), which can be an intermediate towards production of biofuels and/or renewable chemicals. In this work, six guayule genotypes that were planted under either well-irrigated or reduced-irrigation conditions were pyrolyzed using a pyrolysis gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument (PY-GC/MS). The products included condensable gas, non-condensable gas and bio-char. Within the condensable gases, selected compounds were divided into nine chemical classes including aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl phenols, guaiacols, syringols, furans, cyclopentenones, acetic acid and acetol, levoglucosan and limonene groups. As a result, significant variations were observed in the major compounds and prominent sub-constituents of condensable gas among the studied guayule genotypes and under irrigation levels. Strong positive correlations were found between irrigation levels and oxygenated condensable gas components derived from cellulose and lignin, although hydrocarbon components derived from the rubber and resin were found to be negatively correlated with irrigation levels. Results indicated that the genetic variations among guayule genotypes can be used to improve its bioenergy potential, and positive correlations observed among pyrolysis byproducts suggest the possibility to improve several byproducts simultaneously in guayule breeding programs. This research gives an insight to breed for guayule as an economic crop with high bioenergy potential for the development of sustainable agriculture.

N2  - Detecting soil degradation and recognizing its various types is a necessity to take the practical measures for combating it as well as conserving and keeping the agricultural soil healthy. The present study aims at monitoring soil degradation process within the last four decades in the middle part of Nile Delta. To fulfill this objective, Landsat ETM images and digital elevation model (DEM) are used to produce the physiographic map of the studied area at the landform level. Land degradation rate, causative factors, degree, and land degradation status in the study area were assessed using GIS techniques. The results indicate that the most active land degradation factors in the studied area are; water logging, salinization, alkalinization and compaction. The main causative factors of human induced land degradation types in the area are excessive irrigation, human intervention in natural drainage, improperly time use of heavy machinery and the absence of conservation measurements.

N2  - The weathering of silicate minerals removes carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere over geologic timescales and is also investigated as an engineered strategy to mitigate climate change on decadal timescales. “Enhanced rock weathering” (ERW) is a carbon dioxide removal strategy that involves spreading of pulverized, highly reactive silicate rock at the Earth's surface such as within agricultural and natural soils. The rate and efficacy of ERW in agricultural soils to remove CO2 is difficult to quantify owing to the complex geochemical environment including biological-mineral-fluid-atmosphere interactions and human interventions that occur. Column experiments containing wollastonite [CaSiO3] and soils were conducted to investigate the geochemical processes that remove CO2 during ERW, and to determine the potential impact of P-bearing fertilizers on CO2 removal. Columns containing wollastonite, soil, or 8:1 soil-wollastonite mixtures were irrigated with de-ionized water or a 1 × 10−4 M K3PO4 solution. Analysis of column effluent concentrations indicated that P was rapidly removed from solution and retained within the columns, with little difference in weathering rate between columns irrigated with water and those receiving the K3PO4 solution. Bulk wollastonite weathering rates were significantly enhanced in the presence of soils compared to columns with wollastonite alone. Cation concentrations in effluent from columns with soil-wollastonite mixtures were strongly impacted by adsorption to soil surfaces, complicating efforts to estimate CO2 capture. Based on wollastonite weathering rates estimated by Si release, a maximum of 255 kg CO2 t−1 amendment yr−1 was captured in the soil-wollastonite mixture columns. The majority of CO2 stored in the soil-bearing columns was most likely soil-generated rather than removed directly from the atmosphere. The results of this study indicate that adsorption to soils may limit the ability of P to enhance wollastonite weathering, that silicate weathering behaviour within soils differs substantially from that of pure mineral phases, and that CO2 budgets must be carefully constrained to assess the source of stored CO2. Moreover, leachate concentrations of cations and HCO3− may not serve as accurate indicators of the extent of silicate weathering, at least over the short term, due to the numerous processes that control their concentrations in soils, such as sorption to soil components.

N2  - Agricultural water markets play a crucial role in arid and semi-arid regions by reallocating water and transferring it from low-value uses to high-value uses. Several markets for surface water and groundwater are functioning all over the world to increase economic well-being of farmers and meet environmental flow requirements. However, there is not a consensus on precisely which market mechanism may be more environmentally and economically beneficial. This study presents an agent-based groundwater market model to analyze the economic and hydrologic impacts of three market mechanisms, designed based on the cap-and-trade scheme, that differ in the price discovery process, two of which are uniform price double-auction and the third is a discriminatory price double-auction. This study also analyzes the hydrologic and economic impacts of water buyback programs. Modeling results, applied to Rafsanjan Plain, an arid region in Iran, show that the discriminatory price double-auction is the most hydrologically and economically advantageous mechanism since it reduces the annual water level drawdown by 38 % and brings about more profits for farmers in comparison with other market mechanisms. Furthermore, the buyback program effectively reduces the inequality of wealth distribution (Gini Index) and increases farmers' net benefit while reducing their surplus.

N2  - Wild relatives of eggplant (Solanum melongena) are of interest for breeding for tolerance to drought. To assess the potential of eggplant wild relatives from different gene pools, 18 accessions belonging to eggplant and eight wild relatives were evaluated for water stress tolerance. Plants grown in pots were normally irrigated or subjected to water stress by stopping irrigation. Growth and biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress, including proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), total phenolics and total flavonoids contents, and catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, were determined after 11 days of treatment. The reduction of dry matter content in the aerial part of the water-stressed vs. control plants allowed classifying the accessions into three groups: tolerant (< 25% reduction), intermediate (25–35% reduction), or susceptible (> 35% reduction). Proline concentration increased in all accessions under water stress, in particular in the more tolerant ones, which showed an average increase of more than 30-fold over control values, compared to ca. 8-fold in the susceptible accessions. The group of tolerant accessions, which included S. incanum, S. pyracanthos, S. dasyphyllum and S. torvum, was also characterised by unchanged MDA contents and a more pronounced increase in the mean levels of flavonoids (20.6% over the non-stressed controls vs. 3.4% in the intermediate accessions and 5.0% in the least tolerant ones). The activity of antioxidant enzymes was extremely variable within groups and even within the same species. The results obtained reveal a high diversity for drought tolerance in the wild relatives of eggplant and provide insights into the biochemical mechanisms involved in the response to drought in eggplant wild relatives. The tolerant materials identified are of interest for breeding programmes for developing rootstocks and new eggplant cultivars with higher drought tolerance.

N2  - In view of the stagnating productivity levels of irrigated agriculture, the contribution from rainfed agriculture should be increased to meet the requirements from the ever growing human and animal population of India. Land degradation is a major threat to our food and environment security and the extent of degradation problems are more pronounced in rainfed regions. Large potential of rainfed agriculture is untapped largely due to lack of enabling policy support and investments. In drought-prone rainfed areas, watershed management has shown the potential of doubling the agricultural productivity, increase in water availability, restoration of ecological balance in the degraded rainfed ecosystems by greening these areas and diversification of cropping farming systems. Impact of various watershed programmes can be substantially enhanced by developing new approaches and enabling policies new paradigm based on learnings over last 30 years for people-centric holistic watershed management involving convergence, collective action, consortium approach, capacity development to address equity, efficiency, environment and economic concerns is urgently needed. However, this can be used as entry point activity for improving livelihood for rural community. It has been realized that for sustainable developments of degraded lands, involvement of people (land less and beneficiaries) is very much essential. For the last decade efforts have been made institutionalize the organizations of the community & beneficiaries and ensuring their involvement in planning project formulation, implementation and maintenance. Government of India has launched various centre-sector, state-sector and foreign aided schemes for prevention of land degradation, reclamation of special problem areas for ensuring productivity of the land, preservation of land resources and improvement of ecology and environment. These schemes are being implemented on watershed basis in rainfed areas. Soil conservation measures and reclamation of degraded lands are decided considering the land capability and land uses. The efforts made so far resulted in enhancement of agricultural production and productivity of lands, increase in employment generation, improving the environment of the areas and socio-economic upgradation of the people. Integrated watershed management approach has been adopted as a key national strategy for sustainable development of rural areas. This has been proved by conducting monitoring and impact evaluation studies of the integrated watershed projects by external agencies.

N2  - A copula-based stochastic fractional programming (CSFP) method is developed for optimizing water-food-energy nexus (WFEN) system, which can tackle random variables under conflicting objectives and analyze the interrelationship between marginal benefit and system-failure risk. Then, a CSFP-WFEN model is formulated for the Aral Sea basin and multiple scenarios with individual- and joint-probabilistic risks related to water resources, arable land, and hydropower generation are examined. Synthesizing the results under all scenarios, hydropower generation would decrease by 11.9% and crop area would increase by 12.4% by 2035 under severe water scarcity. Agricultural water would decrease with time (from 69.1% in 2021 to 53.9% in 2035), and the share of wheat farmland would increase by 16.4% for food security. Compared with the traditional stochastic fractional programming (SFP) and copula-based stochastic programming (CSP) methods, the marginal benefit from CSFP would be improved 1.7% and water would be saved 9.2%. To support sustainable development of the study basin, some suggestions can be derived from the results: (i) since agriculture is still the largest water user in the future, it is desired to reduce its water consumption through improving irrigation efficiency and adjusting crop planting structure; (ii) effectively reducing Uzbekistan’s water consumption can improve water allocations to other countries and relieve regional conflicts caused by water shortage; (iii) compared to the single management pattern, the integrated optimization of water, food and energy nexus not only has higher efficiency of resources allocation and utilization, but also allows an increased robustness in controlling system-failure risk under joint probabilistic constraints.

N1  - Irrigation efficiency and productivity: scales, systems and science
N2  - This paper re-visits the concept of water efficiency applied to Spanish agriculture and assesses how this technical concept is sometimes lost in translation when applied at different spatial scales. The paper traces the historical dominance of irrigated agriculture in Spanish water policy. It analyses the water efficiency concept at the macro level, by evaluating recent national policy initiatives and public investment programmes over the last decade to modernise irrigation, which anticipated large water savings. “Water efficiency” is then framed in its socio-political context, by looking at debates and discussions over the past, current and future role of irrigation, key evaluation criteria and objectives for large scale irrigation modernisation plans, what are the links to water rights and allocation, benefits and beneficiaries from water savings and important unanticipated consequences and co-benefits in modernisation, and the reform of agricultural policies. Finally it identifies the central role played at national, European and global levels by agricultural (and energy) policies as key external drivers for the long term viability of modern irrigation on social, environmental and economic-productivity terms.

N2  - Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been commonly applied in the last two decades as a substitute for the traditional mathematical programming algorithms in searching for optimal operating rules of reservoir systems. However, only a few GA studies related to reservoir operations addressed the inflow uncertainty. In this study, the reservoir operation rules were developed and evaluated by reflecting the uncertainty of reservoir inflows using the non-dominated sorting GA II algorithm (NSGA-II) through the following procedure: (1) the historical inflow data were classified into four clusters using the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering technique; (2) NSGA-II searched for an optimal release rule in each cluster with all the inflow data of the corresponding cluster; (3) a release response function was then derived for each cluster by regressing the calculated optimal release data against the storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow during the month; and (4) finally, the derived release rules for each cluster were tested with three performance indices, namely, reliability, resilience, and vulnerability. The proposed procedure was applied to the monthly operations of the Lake Tana multi-reservoir system in Ethiopia, which has six upstream irrigation reservoirs and one natural lake that has three release outlets for agriculture, hydropower, and instream requirement. Using the NSGA-II, SOM, and a seasonal ARIMA forecasting model in this study, it is concluded that: 1) the overall performance of the proposed optimization procedure with ARIMA forecasts and cluster approach reaches 84% of the perfect information case across multiple performance measures; 2) the use of the one-month-ahead ARIMA forecasts improves the overall system performance by 8% over simply optimizing to the mean flow; and 3) the use of the four clusters and the consequent RRFs further improves the overall system performance by 14%. Furthermore, this study recommends that, in future, significant efforts should be focused on improving the operation performance of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the Lake Tana system.

N2  - In the era of climate change, decreased precipitation and increased evapo-transpiration hampers the yield of several cereal crops along with the soil salinity and poor ground water resource. Wheat being the moderately tolerant crop face many challenges in the arid and semi-arid regions under irrigated agriculture. In view of this, the study was planned to explore the potential of durum wheat genotypes under salinity on the basis of physiological traits. Experiment was designed as RBD in three replications to evaluate 15 wheat genotypes with moderate saline irrigation (ECiw – 6 dS m−1) and extreme saline irrigation (ECiw – 10 dS m−1) along with one set of control (Best available water). Different physiological traits such as water potential (ψp), osmotic potential (ψs), relative water content (RWC), Na+ and K+ content were recorded in roots as well as shoots at the reproductive stage whereas photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were measured in the flag leaves. A significant variability (p < 0.001) was noted among the genotypes under different stress environments and it was observed that durum genotype HI 8728 and HI 8737 showed less reduction in plant water traits (RWC, ψp and ψs) than the salinity tolerant checks of bread wheat KRL 99 and KRL 3–4. HD 4728 and HI 8708 maintained higher photosynthetic rate as well as higher chlorophyll content under the extreme salinity level of ECiw – 10 dSm−1. No significant differences were found in root Na+ in genotypes KRL 99 (3.17g), KRL 3–4 (3.34g) and HI 8737 (3.41g) while in shoots, lowest accumulation was seen in KRL 99, MACS 3949 and KRL 3–4 at ECiw – 10 dSm−1. The mean range of K+ content was 7.60–9.74% in roots and 4.21–6.61% in shoots under control environment which decreased to 50.77% in roots and 46.05% in shoots under extreme salinity condition of ECiw – 10 dSm−1. At ECiw – 10 dSm−1, KRL 99 maintained highest K+/Na+ in both root and shoot followed by KRL 3–4, HI 8737, MACS 3949, HD 4728 in roots and MACS 3949, KRL 3–4, MACS 4020, HD 4758, MACS 3972 and HI 8713 in shoots. The differential response of durum wheat genotypes under salinity particularly for physiological traits, confer their adaptability towards stress environments and exhibit their potential as genetic sources in breeding programs for improving salt stress tolerance.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture is practiced on 680 million acres worldwide. Irrigated grazing land is likely a significant portion of that area but estimating an accurate figure has remained problematic. Due to its significant contribution to agricultural water use worldwide, we develop a methodology to remotely sense irrigated pasture using a California case study. Irrigated pasture is the third largest agricultural water use in California, yet its economic returns are low. As pressures mount for the agricultural sector to be more water efficient and for water to be directed towards its most economically valuable uses, there will likely be a reduction in irrigated pasture acreage. A first step in understanding the importance of irrigated pasture in California is establishing a methodology to quantify baseline information about its area, location, and current rate of loss. This study used a novel object-based image analysis and supervised classification on publicly-available, high resolution, remote sensing National Agriculture Imaging Program (NAIP) imagery to develop a highly accurate map of irrigated pasture in a rural county in California's Sierra foothills. Irrigated pasture was found to have decreased by 19% during the ten-year period, 2005–2014, from 4,273 to 3,470 acres. The implications of this loss include potential impacts to wetland-dependent species, groundwater recharge, game species, traditional ranching culture, livestock production, and land conservation. Overall accuracy in classification across years was consistently over 89%. Comparing these results against available measurements of irrigated pasture provided by state and federal agencies reveals that this method significantly improves upon existing metrics and methods of data collection and points to critical needs for new targeted research and monitoring efforts. Broadly, the analysis presented here provides an improved methodology for mapping irrigated pasture that can be extended to provide accurate and spatially-explicit data for other counties in California and other arid and semi-arid regions worldwide.

N2  - Models like SWAP, HYDRUS and SALTMED compute crop water uptake under osmotic stress with a dimensionless piecewise linear or S-shaped reduction function. Parameters for these functions, to reduce water uptake, corresponds normally to the Maas and Hoffman salinity threshold and slope values. Unfortunately, extensive crop- and site-specific calibration of the parameters is required. This is because these values, amongst other reasons, serve only as guidelines and express salt tolerance at a time and root-zone average soil salinity and not local total potential heads. In this paper an alternative model (Soil WAter Management Program, SWAMP), that does not rely on these parameters and functions were presented and evaluated. The algorithm used by SWAMP to simulate the water supply of a rooted soil layer and hence water uptake, under decreasing matric potentials was adapted to include the effect of decreasing osmotic potentials. Data from a lysimeter trial was used to evaluate SWAMP. The model was calibrated to represent the soil conditions of the trial, i.e. peas and maize were irrigated with EC's between 20 and 600mSm−1 and grown in sand to sandy loam soils with water tables of the same quality. Under these osmotic stress conditions, SWAMP was able to simulate weekly water uptake of both crops grown on both soils well, i.e. the aggregated accuracy, correlation and pattern performance (ISWAMP) were above 75%. No macro-pattern was observed. Thus, the water uptake residuals contain no structure that is not accounted for in the algorithm and parameters. No extensive calibration was necessary because the parameters for the algorithm were calculated from easily measured inputs. From the three most sensitive parameters, only the critical leaf water potential of a crop might be difficult to obtain. SWAMP contains default values for a number of crops. A model is, therefore, presented that simulate the change in osmotic stress with changing soil water content and that does not rely on the salinity threshold and slope parameters.

N2  - Lake Urmia, located in northwest Iran, was among the world's largest hypersaline lakes but has now experienced a 7 m decrease in water level, from 1278 m to 1271 over 1996 to 2019. There is doubt as to whether the pixel-based analysis (PBA) approach's answer to the lake's drying is a natural process or a result of human intervention. Here, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to a 21-year record (2000−2020) of satellite data products, i.e., temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and irrigated vegetation cover (IVC). The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform utilized over 10 sub-basins in three provinces surrounding Lake Urmia to obtain and calculate pixel-based monthly and seasonal scales for the products. Canonical correlation analysis was employed in order to understand the correlation between variables and lake water level (LWL). The trend analysis results show significant increases in temperature (from 1 to 2 °C during 2000–2020) over May–September, i.e., in 87 %–25 % of the basin. However, precipitation has seen an insignificant decrease (from 3 to 9 mm during 2000–2019) in the rainy months (April and May). Snow cover has also decreased and, when compared with precipitation, shows a change in precipitation patterns from snow to rain. IVC has increased significantly in all sub-basins, especially the southern parts of the lake, with the West province making the largest contribution to the development of IVC. According to the PBA, this analysis underpins the very high contribution of IVC to the drying of the lake in more detail, although the contribution of climate change in this matter is also apparent. The development of IVC leads to increased water consumption through evapotranspiration and excess evaporation caused by the storage of water for irrigation. Due to the decreased runoff caused by consumption exceeding the basin's capacity, the lake cannot be fed sufficiently.

N2  - Agricultural life cycle assessment (LCA) at the sub-national regional level may be a valuable input for the decision-makers. Obtaining representative and sufficient data to develop life cycle inventories (LCIs) at that level is a relevant challenge. This study aims to contribute to the development of LCIs representative Spanish crops based on economic and operational information available in official sources to assess the average environmental impacts of these crops in the main producing regions. A comprehensive approach is proposed considering both the temporal variability and uncertainty of input data by using different methods (e.g. linear programming, weighted averages, Monte Carlo simulation, forecasted irrigation, etc.) to estimate the inventory data of reference holdings. From these inventories, the environmental assessment of those reference holdings is carried out. Two case studies are developed, on orange and tomato crops in the main producing regions, where climate change (CC), freshwater scarcity (WS), human toxicity non-cancer (HTnc), and freshwater ecotoxicity (ET) are evaluated. The environmental scores obtained differ significantly from region to region. The highest environmental scores of orange reference holdings correspond to Comunidad Valenciana for CC (1.94·10−1 kg CO2 eq.) HTnc (4.16·10−11 CTUh) and ET (7.45·10−3 CTUe), and to Andalucia in WS (17.4 m3 world eq.). As to greenhouse tomatoes, the highest scores correspond to Comunidad Valenciana in the four categories analysed (CC = 3.18 kg CO2 eq., HTnc = 3.6·10−9 CTUh, ET = 1.5 CTUe and WS = 13.3 m3 world eq.). The environmental scores estimated in this study are consistent with the literature, showing that the approach is useful to obtain a representative description of the environmental profile of crops from official statistical data and other information sources. Widening the data gathered in ECREA-FADN, and also that from other data sources used, would increase the quality of the environmental impact estimation.

N2  - Natural resource management is critical for addressing issues of water scarcity, land degradation and poor agricultural and livestock productivity especially in rainfed ecologies. This study was conducted in 13 Gram panchayats (cluster of villages) of three states in India representing different agroecological regions. Natural resource management works undertaken through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) covering water harvesting, pasture land and orchard development were evaluated between November 2015 and January 2016. Density of water harvesting varied from 10 to 250 m3 ha−1 depending on topography and works completed in different villages. These structures have contributed significantly to harvesting surface runoff, enhancing groundwater recharge, reducing soil erosion, and flood control. Irrigation acreage increased between 4 ha and 95 ha which is about 5–10% of the total cultivable area in study villages. In addition, crop productivity increased from 30 to 50% both in rainy and post-rainy seasons compared to non-beneficiary fields. The study showed that the selected natural resource management works have the potential to generate additional economic gain from US$ 60 ha−1 year−1 to US$ 225 ha−1 year−1 along with some indirect benefits to strengthen environmental services and rural livelihood. Overall, the MGNREGA has helped in strengthening ecosystem services, viz., provisioning, regulatory, and supporting services in addition to providing employment opportunities. The study also suggests to follow science-led approach in designing and implementation of various NRM works for further improvements and achieving long term sustainability.

N2  - Multipurpose dam construction causes significant social, economic, political, industrial, and environmental impacts on society. The current study sought to understand the water, energy, and food security (WEF) associated with the Tugwi-Mukosi (formerly Tokwe-Mukosi) Dam in Zimbabwe. Insights were drawn from WEF-related literature and official reports on the dam. The dam is set to open many business opportunities in the tourism and hospitality industry, agriculture, retail, and transport. The study showed that the Tugwi-Mukosi Dam is expected to increase the availability of fish; provide water for livestock production, irrigation, and domestic purposes; generate clean energy from hydroelectrical power; and promote enhance tourism development and associated income generation activities. On the other end, the negative impacts of dam construction relate to drowning of people, attack of people and livestock by crocodiles; displacement of people; and increased incidences of water-borne and vector-borne diseases. The study recommended awareness programs to minimize dangers of the drowning of people and crocodile attacks; healthcare interventions by the government and other stakeholders to minimize vectors and water-borne diseases; development of tourist facilities by locals in partnership with other entities to enhance benefits from tourism; training of locals in aquaculture to increase benefits from fish resources; and the setting up of an integrated environmental management plan to enhance the long-term conservation and sustainable utilization of the dam and its resources.

N2  - Castor (Ricinus communis L.) is a non-edible industrial oilseed crop. Its oil has multiferous applications in industry. A vast castor germplasm collection of 3289 accessions is being maintained at ICAR-Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research, Hyderabad, India. The large size of castor germplasm has become a problem for evaluation, conservation and utilization. Hence, a core-set comprising 165 accessions representing diversity in the entire collection was developed. Though the core set is genetically diverse, its utilization in breeding programme is not picking up because of its still large size. In order to enhance efficacy of core set, an attempt was made in to identify core set accessions possessing resistance to major biotic stresses such as Fusarium wilt, root rot, gray mold and leafhopper, and desirable qualitative and quantitative traits. Screening against biotic stresses was done under artificial infestation conditions in field and greenhouse/ploy house at multilocations over years. Evaluation for stability of quantitative and qualitative traits was done at multilocations under rainfed and irrigated conditions. This study has thus identified 26 core set accessions possessing resistance to wilt, root rot, gray mold and leafhopper, and high ricinoleic acid content, high yield and seed weight and early maturity. These accessions would serve as instant basic resources for utilization in breeding programmes to improve castor for resistance to major biotic stresses as well for yield, ricinoleic acid content and early maturity. They also play an important role in diversifying the genetic base of working collection of castor breeders for developing improved cultivars with broad genetic base.

N2  - Gujarat, a rapidly industrializing state in western India, is notorious for groundwater over-exploitation. A perverse link between energy subsidies and groundwater overdraft has left the state with a bankrupt electricity utility and depleted aquifers, especially since the late 1980s. Moreover, this perverse relationship has meant that groundwater irrigators have essentially held Gujarat's non-farm rural economy to ransom. Efforts to regulate groundwater overdraft since the early 1970s have been unsuccessful, as have attempts to charge a rational electricity tariff to groundwater irrigators. During 2003–2006, drawing upon a proposal outlined by researchers, the government launched the Jyotigram (lighted village) scheme, which invested US$ 290 million to separate agricultural electricity feeders from non-agricultural ones, and established a tight regimen for farm power rationing in the countryside. By 2006, Gujarat covered almost all of its 18,000 villages under the Jyotigram scheme of rationalized power supply. With this, two major changes have occurred: (a) villages receive 24h three-phase power supply for domestic uses, in schools, hospitals, village industries, all subject to metered tariff; (b) tubewell owners receive 8h/day of power of full voltage and on a pre-announced schedule. The Jyotigram scheme has radically improved the quality of village life, spurred non-farm economic enterprises, halved the power subsidy to agriculture, and reduced groundwater overdraft. It has also produced positive and negative impacts on medium and large farmers, while notably harming marginal farmers and the landless, who depend for their access to irrigation on water markets which have become much smaller, post-Jyotigram. In addition, the water prices charged by tubewell owners have increased by 30–50%. We propose that the Jyotigram scheme, with some refinements, can be implemented successfully in other regions of South Asia facing similar challenges of groundwater governance.

N2  - The objectives of this chapter are twofold. First, we highlight recent trends in irrigated agricultural production and related factors to shed light on the directions and developments among irrigated agricultural relationships across different US regions over the past 35years. By shedding light on these relationships, similarities and differences across these regions since the late 1970s that may or may not conform to our expectations are identified and provide motivation for more in-depth and targeted research. Second, a dynamic economic–hydrologic model of regional irrigated agricultural production with access to both surface and groundwater supplies is developed to investigate the impacts of changes in (1) surface water and groundwater costs from energy price increases, and (2) surface water availability on agricultural profits and production, water use management, and groundwater levels. The relationship between water and energy in irrigated agricultural production is complex and influenced by relative rates of economic and technical substitution, among other factors. As such, the programming model developed can account for this complexity and provide insight into a wide array of impacts from changes in water supply costs and availabilities.

N2  - Although increase in rice (Oryza spp.) production is a common objective for rice-producing countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), basic information on yield and its variation at farm level is lacking. Field surveys were conducted in irrigated lowland (IL), rainfed lowland (RL), and rainfed upland (RU) rice production systems in 19 SSA countries in the 2012–2014 wet seasons. Mean yield varied widely across sites: 2.2–5.8t/ha, 1.1–5.2t/ha, and 1.0–2.5t/ha in IL, RL, and RU, respectively. Rice yield levels differed between the agro-ecological zones (AEZs) with the highest yield in the semi-arid zone in IL, and in the highlands zone for RL and RU. Cluster analysis identified four groups using mean yields, coefficient of variation, and skewness of yield distribution of 42 site–production system combinations. Grouping was related to production system, AEZ, and field water condition. A high-yielding group with 5.3t/ha mean yield and negative skewness had only four site–production system combinations. Other groups had mean yields from 1.6 to 3.5t/ha with positive skewness. In these groups, research and development priority for lifting rice yield could be given to low-yielding IL and RL sites with large yield gaps. Raising rice yield in the humid zone irrespective of the production systems and RU across AEZs remain major challenges. Further assessment of the impact of farmers’ agricultural practices on yield variation is warranted to identify potential interventions to realize further yield enhancement.

N2  - Reviving the Ganges Water Machine (GWM), coined 40years ago, is the most opportune solution for mitigating the impacts of recurrent droughts and floods in the Ganges River Basin in South Asia. GWM create subsurface storage (SSS) by pumping more groundwater from the aquifers before the monsoon for irrigation and other uses and recharge it during the monsoon. The present study uses fully processed and physically based numerical models, MODFLOW and SWAT, in a semi-coupled modelling framework to examine the technical feasibility of recharging the SSS. The aquifer was simulated as a two-layer system using hydrogeological and groundwater data, model was calibrated from 1999 to 2005 and validated from 2006 to 2010. It assesses the impacts of gradual increase of SSS in 10years from the base year 2010 under two scenarios (increased rainfall or controlled pumping and recharge) to meet a potential unmet demand of 1.68billion cubic meters (Bm3) in the Ramganga sub-basin with an area of 18,668km2. The results show that 3–4m of subsurface storage can be created by groundwater pumping of 0.25Bm3/year by 2020. Under the controlled pumping and recharge scenario, groundwater recharge and river seepage could increase by 14% (4.21–4.80Bm3) and 31% (1.10–1.44Bm3), respectively. However, baseflow will decrease by 30% (0.18–0.12Bm3) over the same time period. The results also show that recharge increased 44% (4.21–6.05Bm3) under an increased rainfall scenario. Simultaneously, river seepage and baseflows would increase 36% (1.10–1.14Bm3) and 11% (0.18–0.20Bm3), respectively. A well-designed managed aquifer recharge program is required to eliminate the negative impact of river flows in the low flow season.

N2  - This study introduces a multi-objective programming model for identifying a cropping pattern to evaluate the feasibility of increasing net profit, reducing water use, and diminishing the environmental impacts, simultaneously, under life cycle assessment (LCA). The research uses data collected in 2016-2017 through a survey in the east of the Lorestan Province of Iran. Results indicate that the multi-objective cropping pattern reduces environmental indicators, including water consumption by 1%, global warming potential by 14%, and nonrenewable energy use by 14%, with no change in farms’ net profit compared to the current pattern in the region. The findings reveal that a designed cropping pattern under the constraints and objectives of LCA not only minimizes the environmental impacts, but also considers the stability of the benefits in the long term. However, the currently applied cropping pattern by farmers only focuses on achieving short-term profit-oriented goals. A new approach to land allocation is necessary to produce crops with a reduction in water consumption, non-renewable energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions in the region. In this regard, it is essential to consider the policies that reduce available water and non-renewable resources into government decisions. On the other hand, policy incentives or disincentives, developing support packages of crop pricing, insurance and facilities support to prevent the cultivation of crops with high water demand and fertilizer are also essential. This proposed planning model should be used as the foundation for long-term cropping pattern planning policies in other irrigated and rainfed farming systems around the world.

N2  - The Syr Darya is one of the major rivers supplying the Aral Sea with freshwater. Soviet programs aimed at maximizing agricultural productivity in the Syr Darya basin increased diversion of water drastically affecting its water quality with significant consequences to its suitability for irrigation, fisheries and other uses. While water quality standards for trace elements are typically measured in the dissolved phase, there is evidence that adsorbed phases may also be relevant. Here we report potentially available heavy metals and metalloid concentrations in the Syr Darya water through the treatment of unfiltered waters samples with dilute nitric acid. Significant differences were found for most studied elements (Mann-Whitney U Test, p < 0.05) between their dissolved and acid-leachable concentrations. For Sr and Se in both sampling campaigns, no significant differences were found between their dissolved and acid-leachable concentrations, indicating their low geochemical reactivity. Dissolved V concentrations and acid-leachable Ni and Zn were found to exceed Kazakhstan Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC) values for the protection of fishery water quality. Our study evaluates the importance of considering regulatory issues of measuring trace metal concentrations to assess the water suitability for fisheries and irrigation.

N2  - Deficit irrigation practices and utilization of rootstocks that are tolerant to water stress are critical strategies for the protection of water resources and sustainable irrigation management, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the yield and quality of watermelon grafted onto different rootstocks under deficit irrigation conditions during 2017 and 2018 in the Konya Plain of Turkey, where the semi-arid climate is prevalent. In this study, five different plant materials, such as citroides1 (A1), citroides2 (A2), gourd (A3), hybrid TZ148 (A4) rootstocks grafted with the Crimson Tide variety, and non-grafted Crimson Tide as control (K1), were used as the main-plots. Five different irrigation levels, calculated by taking into account the amounts of cumulative water (Ep) that evaporated at 7-day intervals from Class A Pan (I100 = 1.00Ep; I75 = 0.75Ep; I50 = 0.50Ep; I35 = 0.35Ep, and I0 = rain-fed), were used as the sub-plots. When the average of experimental years was considered, the highest rate of evapotranspiration (ET) was found in the plot A4I100 (615 mm). The highest fruit yield was obtained from the A4I100 (93.4 t/ha), and an increase in yield of up to 35 % was achieved in the A4I100, compared to non-grafted plants applied I100 irrigation level (K1I100). The analysis of data by both separate evaluation and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the yield values obtained from plants grafted onto A4, A1, and A2 rootstocks applied I75 irrigation level were higher than non-grafted plants applied I100 irrigation level. The water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) ranged between 7.1–17.4 kg/m3 and 11.7–25.0 kg/m3, respectively, and a significant increase in the values of WP and IWP was achieved by grafting. This two-year study revealed that the performances of citron watermelon rootstocks were found close to the TZ148 rootstock in terms of fruit yield, certain yield components, WP, and IWP. Thus, it has also been demonstrated that the citron watermelons could be used commercially as watermelon rootstocks, and citron watermelon rootstocks could be used as watermelon rootstocks in breeding programs, in order to save water, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.

N2  - The study was carried out in order to determine the effect of different irrigation scheduling programs and water stress, imposed at different growth stages, on the maturity and leaf chemistry of Virginia tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Field experiments and lab investigations were carried out during 2000–2003, on a silty loam Entisol soil, poor in organic matter and rich in potassium, on the fields of Atatürk Soil and Water Resources Research Institute in Kirklareli, Turkey. A randomized complete block experimental design with three replications was applied, and K-326 Virginia tobacco cultivar was used in the experiment. Three known stages of the plant – vegetative (V), yield formation (F), and ripening (R) – were considered, and a total of 14 irrigation treatments (including rain-fed) were applied. All the experimental treatments were irrigated on the same day of VFR and were irrigated at each growth stage with the amount of water required to fill the 0–90cm soil depth to field capacity; and three levels of water reductions (0%, 40% and 60%) were done at each development stage. Results of the investigations show that irrigation scheduling and the water stress imposed during different stages of growth influenced the ripening dynamics of Virginia tobacco leaves and that severe water stress causes delay in the ripening of the leaves. Favorable moisture conditions considerably decrease the nicotine and nitrogen content of the Virginia tobacco leaves, both of which are hazardous for humans, to the ranges of 0.85–1.21% versus 2.1–2.2% under stress (for nicotine), and 1.4–1.6% versus 1.8–2.0%, and 2.0–2.4% versus 2.9–3.1% (for nitrogen) for 2001 and 2003, respectively. However the percentage of chloride and sodium in the leaf increases if the amount of seasonal water is increased. It was determined also that close linear relationships exist between seasonal irrigation water amounts or seasonal evapotranspiration and any of the chemical traits. Mutual relationships between nicotine and each of the traits – i.e. nitrogen, chloride, potassium, and sodium – were also established.

N2  - Growing demands for water, energy, and food put many systems at a composite risk of resource shortages. There was a lack of approaches capable of effectively assessing tridimensional composite risk and describing non-linear correlations among subsystem risks within a Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus system. In this study, an integrated approach was developed to assess the composite risk of WEF nexus systems and generate risk-based plans. Specifically, a composite risk assessment model that could capture the interdependence among the risk for water, energy, and food shortage was proposed. Furthermore, a generalized Copula-based chance-constrained programming model and its solving algorithm were developed. The proposed approach has been applied to an agricultural WEF nexus system in northern China, where the shortage of water, energy and / or land affected agricultural outputs. Results show that the composite risk of the entire system would be higher than the maximum value among subsystem risks, but less than their sum. Higher composite risks could bring higher benefits. Under a certain composite risk, the overall system benefit would vary with different combinations of subsystem risks; and it could be promoted through coordinating resources supplied by different subsystems. A risk - benefit frontier consisting of optimal solutions corresponding to different combinations of composite and subsystem risks was identified through Monte Carlo simulation. The scheme that could generate 12.76 billion Yuan under a moderate composite risk level of 0.22 was recommended for the study problem. Accordingly, net irrigation water, energy for agriculture, and effective irrigation area should be no less than 1.66 × 109 m3, 81.08 × 103 tce, and 509.12 × 103 hm2, respectively.

N2  - Environmental (i.e., meteorological and landscape) factors and management practices can affect the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in produce production environments. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria species (including L. monocytogenes), Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in produce production environments and to identify environmental factors and management practices associated with their isolation. Ten produce farms in New York State were sampled during a 6-week period in 2010, and 124 georeferenced samples (80 terrestrial, 33 water, and 11 fecal) were collected. L. monocytogenes, Listeria spp., Salmonella, and STEC were detected in 16, 44, 4, and 5% of terrestrial samples, 30, 58, 12, and 3% of water samples, and 45, 45, 27, and 9% of fecal samples, respectively. Environmental factors and management practices were evaluated for their association with terrestrial samples positive for L. monocytogenes or other Listeria species by univariate logistic regression; analysis was not conducted for Salmonella or STEC because the number of samples positive for these pathogens was low. Although univariate analysis identified associations between isolation of L. monocytogenes or Listeria spp. from terrestrial samples and various water-related factors (e.g., proximity to wetlands and precipitation), multivariate analysis revealed that only irrigation within 3 days of sample collection was significantly associated with isolation of L. monocytogenes (odds ratio = 39) and Listeria spp. (odds ratio = 5) from terrestrial samples. These findings suggest that intervention at the irrigation level may reduce the risk of produce contamination.

N2  - In Jordan, water rather than land is the determining factor for increasing the size and the productivity of the irrigated areas. Traditional surface irrigation is the general practice and the farmers themselves have been managing their water in terms of distribution and scheduling. The major developments in irrigation started in the 1950s, aiming at integrated rural development of the Jordan Valley, which would utilize Jordan's share of the water resources of the Jordan River System. Currently, irrigation is practiced in two main areas: the Jordan rift valley (JRV) and the Upland. The soil characteristics are subject to continuous changes based on a number of environmental factors. Many types of soil play a large part in classifying the plants into environmental groups. The macronutrients (N, P, K) and some of the heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) have been investigated in soil profiles irrigated by different water qualities. Two agricultural areas were selected for this purpose; one irrigated with fresh water from the Yarmouk River and the other irrigated with treated wastewater from King Talal Dam. In all farms, three trenches (inlet, middle and outlet of the row) were dug in the irrigated area, while in the non-irrigated area one trench was dug as a control. Each trench was 60cm wide and 60cm deep. Nine samples from each trench were collected at 20cm intervals horizontally and vertically, making a total of 486 samples from all farms and control points. The results showed that the concentrations of the heavy metals in the soils from the selected farms lie within the accepted values. The results indicate that there are no adverse impacts of irrigation water for agricultural practices. It was also found that there was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen, potassium and phosphate in most of the selected farms, which reflects the extensive use of fertilizers. An awareness program is highly recommended in order to draw the attention of farmers to this serious problem.

N2  - Chickpea is an important livelihood option and nutritious food source for many subsistence farming communities in the developing world. Although India is the biggest chickpea producing nation, the demands of its growing population are not met by domestic production. This study uses a modelling approach to quantify the region-specific constraints and yield gaps limiting chickpea productivity and evaluates the potential for boosting production in the major chickpea growing regions of India. Information on bio-geo-physical properties (weather, soil, crop, management) of these regions was collated and the SSM-iLegume model used to reproduce seasonal variability and potential yield for the major chickpea producing districts to estimate the yield gap. Further, we estimated the difference between the yield potential and the currently achieved yields; i.e. yield-gap. The results showed that India has the capacity to produce 40% more chickpea (i.e. 80% of the achievable yield) than is the current production status under the standard crop management practices. We also found that chickpea crop production in rain-fed systems is largely limited by water availability during the season (∼64%) but with large variability in the drought stress effect on yields between the investigated districts. Observed geo-bio-physical properties of the districts and simulation results of yield gap analysis were used to cluster chickpea-growing districts into six distinct units with higher degrees of similarities; i.e. homogeneous system units (HSU). Within each HSU a similar system response to genotype-by-management (GxM) intervention is expected and the effects of particular interventions could be further tested using the modelling set-up developed for this study. The identified HSUs, each with a well-defined set of yield-limiting constraints, are proposed as authentic breeding units in crop improvement programs (“target population of environments”) and we further discuss the need to use the HSU-specific breeding strategy to enhance chickpea production in India.

N2  - In hybrid maize (Zea mays L.) seed production, both the kernel quality and the germination rate, which are positively related to kernel weight (KW), are very important. Water deficit can change the source–sink ratio (SSR) and thus affects KW. To create a water-saving irrigation program that facilitates the production of high-quality seed, it is necessary to properly model the KW–water relationship. Irrigation experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in an arid region of Northwest China to investigate the effects of deficit irrigation on maize plant biomass and yield; and pollination experiments were conducted in 2016 to obtain a wide range of SSR and KW data. Analysis of the results showed that water deficit at the vegetative or flowering stages reduced post-flowering biomass gain (PBG) and kernel number (KN), thus significantly affecting SSR. At the grain-filling stage it reduced PBG but had no significant effect on KN, thus reducing SSR. Only the treatment of no irrigation in the grain-filling stage in 2015 significantly reduced KW. The Jensen model can accurately simulate the relationship between PBG and relative evapotranspiration at each growth stage. The water sensitivity index of PBG in the vegetative, flowering, grain-filling and ripening stages were respectively 0.48, 0.48, 0.97, and 0.16. Based on the experimental data of 2016, the hyperbolic upper (UpKW) and lower (LowKW) limit equations were created for KW as a function of SSR using boundary analysis. UpKW and LowKW increased as SSR increased, but the difference between UpKW and LowKW first increased and then decreased as SSR increased. When SSR was 0, UpKW was 178.39 mg and LowKW was 155.56 mg. When SSR is not less than 867.23 mg kernel−1, UpKW and LowKW are both 326.97 mg, which is the potential KW. Combined with the KN–water model, the models developed in this study can be used to develop a water-saving and irrigation program that produces high-quality seed.

N2  - Increase grain yield potential is one of the most important objectives of any cereal crop breeding program. To efficiently develop superior rice lines by the introgression of favorable alleles for yield and yield component traits, a strategy of alternate phenotype–genotype selection was used. The present study aimed to (i) investigate the allelic diversity of loci associated with major yield-component traits and (ii) phenotype and genotype advanced populations derived from crosses between NERICA-L-20 and Giza178 for yield component traits using agro-morphological descriptors and GRiSP polymorphic markers to select superior high-yielding rice lines. A total of 100 F2:3 progeny were selected from 1000 F2 plants and genotyped with 16 polymorphic markers linked to four major yield-component traits. Four promising F2:3 lines (ARS 563–14, ARS 563–62, ARS 563–286, and ARS 563–41) bearing combinations of desirable alleles were selected. A selected set of 20 F2:4 lines showed moderate to high heritability for all target traits. Fourteen F2:5 lines derived from ARS 563–14 and 17 F2:5 from ARS 563–286 families were evaluated in preliminary trials to estimate yield gain. The three top lines, ARS 563–286–16-1-1, ARS 563–286–5-1-1, and ARS 563–14–10-1-1, showed an increase of more than 10% grain yield over the best check, Sahel 108, which is widely cultivated in the Senegal River valley. The 16 markers linked to the target yield component traits can be used to fast-track breeding programs targeting rice productivity.

N2  - An open-top chamber experiment was conducted in the present study to investigate the growth and biochemical responses of six sorghum genotypes under two irrigation regimes (based on 40% and 75% soil-water depletion) and two N fertilizer levels (0 and 105 kgN ha−1), at two atmospheric CO2 conditions (390 ± 50 and 700 ± 50 μmol mol−1). The results revealed that water limited stress decreased the plant dry weight by reducing the plant leaf area, SPAD value, Fv/Fm, leaf RWC and membrane stability index (MSI), while it increased the specific activity of APX, CAT and POX enzymes, DPPH, LPC, Phe, TSC, H2O2, MDA and EL. The lowest decrease of the plant dry weight due to limited water stress was observed in the GS5 genotype, which was followed by the lowest decrease in the leaf RWC and MSI; also, the highest increase was seen in APX, Phe and TSC, while the lowest one was recorded in EL. Elevated CO2 improved DPPH and Phe under both control and water limited conditions, resulting in the decrease of APX, POX, H2O2 and EL, while a more pronounced effect was observed in the stress conditions. Furthermore, with the application of nitrogen, the reduction in DPPH, H2O2 and MDA values was greater under water limited stress rather than control conditions. It could be, therefore, concluded that the responses of sorghum genotypes to water deficit stress had interaction with atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen levels; this could be considered in breeding programs as well as planting management of sorghum.

To date, selection of promising genotypes is based on empirical evaluation for grain yield, but the relationship of agronomic traits to yield in tropical rice breeding is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the extent of variation for 19 agronomic traits and interrelationships among traits in an irrigated rice breeding program at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. A large set of elite germplasm comprising advanced genotypes and varieties derived from the breeding pipeline was evaluated during dry and wet seasons. The broad-sense heritability ranged from 0.35 to 0.99 for all traits in both seasons. Grain yield for the whole plot (plot yield) was positively correlated with yield per plant, 1000 grain weight, and grain width in dry season, and yield per plant, 1000 grain weight, grain width, number of panicles per plant, and panicle exertion rate in wet season. Path analysis showed that the highest direct positive effect of traits on plot yield ranged from 0.25 to 0.45 in dry season and from 0.22 to 0.88 in wet season. Heat map bi-cluster analysis assigned genotypes into three main clusters in both seasons, while traits were grouped into three and five clusters in dry and wet seasons, respectively. The cluster analysis showed that spikelets per panicle, filled grains per plant, and yield per plant were key yield contributing traits. Identification of traits that were highly correlated with rice yield could be useful for developing new varieties adapted to tropical environments.

N2  - Characterizing the composition of pest communities across variable cropping landscapes is critical for developing integrated management programs due to variation across species in their ecology and impacts on crops. Wireworms, the soil-dwelling larvae of click beetles, have resurged as major pests of cereal crops in the Pacific Northwestern United States, but knowledge of the composition of wireworm communities across cereal-growing landscapes remains limited. Here, we conducted a large-scale field survey of wireworms across a broad region in the Pacific Northwest. We identified a total of 13 wireworm species across samples taken from 160 fields in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The most common species were Limonius infuscatus, L. californicus, and Selatosomus pruininus, which together represented approximately 90% of collected larvae. Wireworm communities were more abundant and diverse in spring wheat and conservation reserve program compared with winter wheat fields. Interestingly, L. californicus was the only species that was more abundant in cultivated wheat crops than in native grass fields, suggesting that this species persists in crop habitats throughout its life cycle and thus might exert stronger impacts on winter crops compared to other species. Our results indicate that Limonius species are distributed mostly in the intermediate and higher precipitation zones or in irrigated fields, while S. pruininus is confined to drier regions. As the dominant wireworm species, the diversity of wireworm communities, and total wireworm abundance varied across crops, landscapes, and climatic regions, management practices should vary across regions for maximum effectiveness.

N2  - Irrigation has traditionally been managed as uniform applications where an entire field receives the same depth of water. Motivation to improve current irrigation practices has led to different approaches utilizing remotely-sensed images to inform variable rate irrigation management. This study conducted in 2019 and 2020 implemented the Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI), a remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) and water balance model, for managing variable rate irrigation of a maize and soybean field. This model tracked soil water content through the estimation of daily ET and tracking of various water fluxes entering and leaving a field. SETMI was used in two different irrigation treatments informed using Planet satellite (SETMI-SAT) and unmanned aerial system (UAS, SETMI-UAS) remotely-sensed images. A uniform irrigation approach managed by a professional crop consultant and a non-irrigated approach were used as the baseline in comparing irrigation management approaches. The irrigation treatments were evaluated on dry grain yield, gross irrigation, actual ET, deep percolation, change in soil water content, and water productivity. The uniform irrigation approach managed by the crop consultant applied the highest irrigation in 2019 and 2020 for maize (2019: 155 mm, 2020: 213 mm) and soybean (2019: 124 mm; 2020: 183 mm) while the SETMI irrigation treatments applied less irrigation for maize (2019: 131, 132 mm; 2020: 154, 140 mm) and soybean (2019: 116, 94 mm; 2020: 154, 175 mm). Maize yield was highest for the uniform irrigation approach in 2019 (14.9 Mg ha−1) and 2020 (13.3 Mg ha−1). The highest soybean yield was produced by the SETMI-SAT irrigation management approach in 2019 (5.0 Mg ha−1) and 2020 (4.8 Mg ha−1). Significant differences (p-value < 0.05) in applied irrigation between the uniform and SETMI irrigation management approaches were observed while there were no significant differences in dry grain yield for both maize and soybean in 2019 and 2020. At least one of the SETMI irrigation treatments produced higher crop, irrigation, and ET water productivity values in comparison to those produced by the uniform irrigation treatment for all crop-years. A post-season analysis was completed using the SETMI-UAS and SETMI-SAT treatments to evaluate the accuracy of estimated rootzone soil water depletion provided by SETMI. Rootzone depletion calculated from neutron probe volumetric soil water content measurements were compared to the modeled depletion from the SETMI-UAS and SETMI-SAT treatments. The 2020 modeled and measured depletion comparison produced better agreement resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) < 17 mm compared to 2019 (RMSE < 27 mm). The VRI center pivot malfunctioned during the 2019 season which caused unresolved discrepancies between actually applied irrigation and what the system was programmed to apply. The VRI system was fixed before the 2020 season.

N2  - Drought is the predominant cause of yield reduction in rainfed rice production systems, but until recently, little systematic effort has been made to breed drought-tolerant cultivars. The complex nature of drought tolerance, genotype×environment interaction, and the difficulty of effective drought tolerance screening complicate the development of drought tolerant varieties. This study reports on progress made by a collaborative network of Indian rice breeding programs, in partnership with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to develop lines combining high yield potential with drought tolerance by employing direct selection for grain yield under drought stress, and testing their performance in rainy season managed-drought screenings (RSMDS) of different stress severity levels at several locations during the main season in rainfed rice production areas in India. Advanced-generation breeding lines of less than 100 days, 100–120 days, and greater than 120 days duration generated at eight national institutes and IRRI using diverse drought tolerant donors were evaluated in 2005–2007 under RSMDS. Stress was imposed at the reproductive stage, either by draining paddies shortly after transplanting for lowland trials, or by stopping irrigation before flowering for upland trials. Yield reduction of 34–53% under moderate stress and 65–88% under severe stress was achieved in comparison to irrigated controls. Several varieties that have been widely grown in rainfed environments in India for many years, including IR 36, IR 64, Mahamaya, Sambha Mahsuri, and Swarna, were shown to be highly susceptible. Breeding lines were identified that perform consistently better than these and other widely grown rainfed varieties under both moderate and severe drought stress without any yield penalty under fully irrigated conditions. In the combined analysis over locations and years, these promising breeding lines outyielded the widely grown controls by about 0.5tha−1 under moderate stress and 0.7–1.0tha−1 under severe stress. IRRI breeding lines contributed to the network were developed using a selection protocol involving replicated dry season managed-drought screening (DSMDS) in dry season at Los Banos, Philippines. For a subset of lines extensively tested both at IRRI and in India, correlations between yield under DSMDS in the Philippine and yield in RSMDS in India were moderately high, indicating the efficacy of dry-season MS screening at IRRI in identifying tolerant lines for India. Drought tolerant lines developed by the network members have been released in several Indian states and in the Philippines. Overall, these results indicate that managed stress screening for drought tolerance, with a focus on selection for yield under stress, is effective in generating drought-tolerant cultivars.

N2  - The spatial and temporal impacts of climate change on irrigation water
requirements and yield for sugarcane grown in Swaziland have been
assessed, by combining the outputs from a general circulation model
(HadCM3), a sugarcane crop growth model and a GIS. The CANEGRO model
(embedded with the DSSAT program) was used to simulate the baseline and
future cane net annual irrigation water requirements (IRnet) and yield
(t ha(-1)) using a reference site and selected emissions scenario (SRES
A2 and B2) for the 2050s (including CO2-fertilisation effects). The
simulated baseline yields were validated against field data from 1980 to
1997. An aridity index was defined and used to correlate agroclimate
variability against irrigation need to estimate the baseline and future
irrigation water demand (volumetric). To produce a unit weight of
sucrose equivalent to current optimum levels of production, future
irrigation needs were predicted to increase by 20-22%. With
CO2-fertilisation, the impacts of climate change are offset by higher
crop yields, such that IRnet is predicted to increase by 9%. The study
showed that with climate change, the current peak capacity of existing
irrigation schemes could fail to meet the predicted increases in
irrigation demand in nearly 50% of years assuming unconstrained water
availability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Irrigation projects often result in many far-reaching environmental changes. This paper considers the case of the Hetao Irrigation District, the largest irrigation project along the Yellow River in China, and studies the impacts of agricultural water management on the hydrology and the environment. Long-term data (1954–2013) concerning irrigation, drainage, soil salinity, groundwater, and the environment of Wuliangsuhai Wetland, the lake that receives the drainage water, were collected and analyzed. The findings show that uncontrolled irrigation and the absence of effective drainage initially resulted in a rising groundwater table, worsening soil salinization, and the expansion of the lake, which is an important internationally recognized wetland. The completion of an artificial drainage system and the implementation of water-saving practices have had promising effects on lowering the groundwater table and controlling soil salinity. However, the risk of soil salinity is still threatening the irrigation system because salt is continuously accumulating within it and the total dissolved salts (TDS) in the groundwater are increasing. For better soil salinity control, more effective drainage is necessary to drain more salt and lower the water table, but this may harm the natural vegetation and the eco-environment of the Wuliangsuhai Lake because the non-point-source pollution from agricultural drainage has resulted in a serious eco-crisis in the Wuliangsuhai Lake. The results show that it is important to ensure there is a certain amount of low-TDS drainage water to protect the Wuliangsuhai Lake environment. Therefore, a balance must be achieved among soil salinity control, groundwater quality, favorable conditions for natural vegetation, and wetland protection. Further research is needed to develop optimal agricultural water management strategies, especially in the context of the ongoing water-saving renovation program.

N2  - This paper reports on an empirical investigation of the impact of the Rural Land Registration and Certification Program (RLRC) on land rental among farmers in China. Propensity Score Matching and an IV-Tobit estimation are used in the estimate to overcome endogeneity problems caused by sample selection bias and reverse causality. The China Labor-force Dynamics Survey provides the data. Results show that the RLRC is associated with an increase in the rental scale of cultivated land (especially dryland) but has no significant impact on scale of irrigated land among farmers. Policy recommendations include consideration of village- and farm-specific factors that have been shown to affect adoption including village-support and level of natural endowment for agricultural land.

N2  - Water and nutrient absorption is closely associated with the root system structure and root characteristics. This study was designed to evaluate root characteristics of six sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) genotypes grown under full and deficit irrigation regimes in two-year rhizotube experiments. The results revealed that deficit irrigation regime resulted in higher root depth and root to shoot ratio, but the lower root length compared with that in the full irrigation regime. In addition, all the genotypes respond to deficit irrigation by increasing root depth. Although root depth increased in response to deficit irrigation, Sudan-94 genotype showed the maximum increase (44%), followed by USA-ns-96 genotype (35%). Similarly, root to shoot ratio increased due to deficit irrigation and Oltan and USA-ns-96 genotypes showed the maximum increase. Under deficit irrigation regime, root biomass decreased with increasing soil depth in Naz, Dashtestan-2, Darab-1, Oltan and USA-ns-96 genotypes; however, root biomass increased in Sudan-94 with increasing soil depth until a reduction was found at a depth of 0.6–0.9 m. The maximum values for dry root weight (10.89 g) and root length (25,875 mm) were related to USA-ns-96, but Sudan-94 showed the maximum root depth (114 cm) and root to shoot ratio (0.36) compared with other genotypes. Sudan-94 genotype was the only genotype in which all root traits increased due to deficit irrigation, suggesting that Sudan-94 genotype may be associated with increased tolerance to drought stress and can be considered as a desirable genotype in breeding programs.

N2  - Methane (CH4) emissions are responsible for the higher global warming potential of rice cultivation. There are scattered reports on the use of chemical interventions for reducing CH4 emissions from rice. A laboratory study was carried out to estimate the CH4 mitigation potential of oxygen releasing chemicals such as magnesium peroxide (MgO2) and calcium peroxide (CaCO2), chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), nitrification inhibitors thiourea and neem oil, limus (urease inhibitors), phosphogypsum (PG) a byproduct of phosphate fertilizer industry and ammonium sulfate (AS). The cumulative CH4 emission from soil reduced by 2.0–32.3% under the different treatments during the 45 days’ incubation study. Subsequently, four chemicals having the highest CH4 reduction potential i.e. PG, EDTA, AS, and MgO2 were further evaluated for the mitigation of CH4 and their concurrent impact on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in a two-year experiment growing rice. PG, EDTA, AS, and MgO2 significantly (p = 0.0025) decreased CH4 emissions by 9.3−27.5% as compared to the control. The cumulative N2O emission were significantly lower by 13.9% under PG as compared to control. The global warming potential decreased by 6.8% with MgO2 to 23.6% with PG. The grain yield increased by 3.1–11.2% under the different treatments. The greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was the highest in control (0.309 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 grain yield) and lowest in PG (0.212 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 grain yield). The findings suggest that PG, EDTA, AS, and MgO2 can be used to plummet the global warming potential of irrigated rice soils without any yield penalty. More research is required to be undertaken to evaluate the impact of these chemicals from the perspective of food security in the farmers’ fields.

N2  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L). Wilczek) is becoming an important grain legume in Nepal. It can be grown as an additional crop after harvesting winter crops such as winter wheat, winter legumes and oilseeds and before planting main season rice from the low-altitude Terai through to the middle hills of Nepal. Replacing short fallows in the spring, it provides additional high quality food, enhances soil fertility and increases the yield of the following crop. In spite of continued varietal research by the National Grain Legume Research Programme, no mungbean varieties were released from 1975 to 2006. The old variety, Pusa Baishakhi, was released in 1975, but became susceptible to Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) and several other diseases so mungbean became limited to a rarely grown, green manure crop. In 2003, we introduced four mungbean varieties resistant to MYMV from the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre. These were evaluated in participatory varietal selection (PVS) mother and baby trials in low fertility and droughted conditions using farmers’ levels of inputs and management. Variety spread was promoted by distributing free small seed samples in a process known as Informal Research and Development (IRD); and community-based seed production and marketing. Of the four varieties, NM94 and VC6372 consistently produced higher grain yields than the local check varieties, were resistant to MYMV and hence were preferred by farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives endorsed a new variety release procedure in 2005 that permitted the use of data from PVS trials to support the release or registration of new crop varieties. In 2006, on the basis of data generated from PVS trials alone, the National Seed Board released NM94 as ‘Kalyan’ while, on the basis of combined data from the PVS trials and from on-station trials, VC6372 (45-8-1) was released as ‘Prateeksha’. The use of PVS contributed greatly to fast-tracking the release process and this resulted in farmers getting new MYMV-resistant mungbean varieties more quickly. Varieties spread rapidly through IRD and farmer-to-farmer seed networks and provided benefits to farming households. Regulatory reforms to speed up and simplify the process of varietal release are discussed.

N2  - Determining the parameters of the soil water retention curve (SWRC) is essential to model the water flow in soil and investigate the water and nutrients transport around the roots of plants and ensure optimal management of irrigation. The unweighted least squares regression (ULS) is the most common approach applied to fit the SWRC functions to the observed data-points to optimize their parameters. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the ULS and the weighted least squares regression (WLS) fitting process of SWRC and their impact on simulations of soil water flow. In this regard, the measured SWRC data in six parallel samples from given depth were fitted to the SWRC equations to optimize their parameters, through either the WLS or the ULS. In the WLS approach, the weights were calculated as the inverse of the variance in each pressure head of different iterations (six repetitions in this study). The results showed that although WLS generally resulted in an increased error in estimating the SWRC in the van Genuchten-Mualem model (RMSE = 0.027 and 0.043 cm3 cm−3 in the ULS and WLS methods, respectively), it improved the accuracy of the estimations at lower water contents (dry-end), as compared to the ULS. However, the efficiency of the ULS and WLS in estimating the SWRC was different from that in simulating the soil water flow. The water flow in the soil was more accurately simulated using the hydraulic parameters obtained by the WLS (with RMSE = 0.029 and 0.026 cm3 cm-3 at x = 0 and x = 20 cm, respectively, in the WLS, and RMSE = 0.062 and 0.065 cm3 cm-3 at x = 0 and x = 20 cm, respectively, in the ULS), especially at the low water range. While there was an important difference between the ULS and WLS in terms of estimating the SWRC and water flow simulations, other dispersion scenarios should be evaluated in future studies to compute the error of the fitting processes at low-pressure heads.

N2  - Footrot is a contagious disease of sheep and other small ruminants. The causative agent, Dichelobacter nodosus, is transmitted between hooves via contaminated pasture and soil. However, the bacterium cannot invade the epidermis unless it is compromised in some manner and water maceration, which follows prolonged exposure to a moist substrate, is the most common predisposing factor. Experimental infection models have been used extensively to study the aetiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of footrot. In Australia, an indoor, pen-based, infection model involving standing sheep on wet mats and bandaging inoculum onto the foot has been used commonly but does not accurately represent the pasture environment and has an impact on animal welfare. Instead, we predisposed sheep on irrigated pasture and compared three methods for infecting them with D. nodosus: application of inoculum to the interdigital skin with a swab, dripping inoculum onto the interdigital skin with a pipette, and spraying inoculum onto the pasture on which the sheep grazed. We were able to establish D. nodosus infections using all three methods but selected the swab method for further use because the dose can be controlled. It was used in two field trials and infection was established in 70 %–100 % of sheep. The infection model developed in this study improves animal welfare by reducing the level of intervention. However, as the model is pasture-based, seasonal weather patterns need to be considered to ensure predisposition and disease expression. Further research will be required to understand the environmental conditions required for transmission of D. nodosus and the clinical expression of disease.

N1  - Ecological management for human-dominated urban and regional ecosystems
N2  - The overall goal of this paper is to analyze the impacts of the urbanization on regional and national agricultural production through its impact on water use in agriculture in China. Given the historical trend of water use in agriculture and its correlation with urbanization, the change in agricultural water use due to urbanization is estimated. Then the impacts of this change on regional crop production are simulated based on the China Water Simulation Model (CWSM). Within CWSM, a positive mathematical programming (PMP) optimizes water allocation among crops and between irrigated and rainfed areas within a crop in each of ten river basins in China. The results show that water use in China has an obvious increasing trend, particularly in the industrial and domestic sectors, while the share of water use in agricultural sector has been dropping. A 1-percentage-point increase in urbanization can result in a 0.47 percentage-point decline in share of water use. Based on the model simulation, this will lead to the further decrease of irrigated areas and the increase of rainfed areas at both the national and river basin levels, particularly for water intensive crops (such as rice and wheat). Accordingly, average yields and total production will also decrease. A river basin with large production of either rice or wheat (or both) decreases more in irrigated area as urban area expands. Adaptation measures are recommended for both authorities and farmers to ensure food security, such as providing incentive for farmers to adopt water saving technology, implementing appropriate institutional and policy innovations (e.g., water use association, water pricing and water use rights).

N1  - Water Scarcity and Integrated Water Resources Management
N2  - In this paper, we introduced three-nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function into a static Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model. Through four levels of factor productivity, we constructed three nested production function of land use productivity in the conceptual modeling frameworks. The first level of factor productivity is generated by the basic value-added land. On the second level, factor productivity in each sector is generated by human activities that presents human intervention to the first level of factor productivity. On the third level of factor productivity, water allocation reshapes the non-linear structure of transaction among first and second levels. From the perspective of resource utilization, we examined the economic efficiency of water allocation. The scenario-based empirical analysis results show that the three-nested CES production function within CGE model is well-behaved to present the economy system of the case study area. Firstly, water scarcity harmed economic production. Government investment on water projects in Gansu thereby had impacts on economic outcomes. Secondly, huge governmental financing on water projects bring depreciation of present value of social welfare. Moreover, water use for environment adaptation pressures on water supply. The theoretical water price can be sharply increased due to the increasing costs of factor inputs. Thirdly, water use efficiency can be improved by water projects, typically can be benefited from the expansion of water-saving irrigation areas even in those expanding dry area in Gansu. Therefore, increasing governmental financing on water projects can depreciate present value of social welfare but benefit economic efficiency for future generation.

N2  - During the construction and especially water filling periods of Keban and Atatürk dams in the Euphrates River Basin, there have been a series of high level political tensions among Turkey, Syria, and Iraq for the allocation of trans-boundary water resources. It has been claimed that those large investments not only contribute to those investing countries but also to those affected ones. This research measures the contributions and impacts of major investments on the basin to the riparian countries. And how spatial land use decisions on irrigated agricultural areas in rival basin countries are made by means of optimization techniques. The model application is based on with and without analyses for the selected group of dams, which are Keban, Karakaya, Atatürk, Ilısu, Tabqa, Haditha, and Mosul dams, Habbaniye Reservoir, and Urfa Tunnels. The mixed integer programming (MIP) based on the Inter Temporal Euphrates and Tigris River Basin Model (ITETRBM) is used as an optimization tool for the necessary analysis. The impacts are presented by countries and by the generated economic benefits, water withdrawals, coverage areas of irrigated agricultural land, cities feasibly supplied from the reservoirs. The results have shown that large reservoirs in Turkey provide extensive contribution to the basin countries especially during drought periods when all major reservoir investments are considered together. That can be considered as potential for coalition during drought periods instead of competition.

N2  - Climate change impacts to crop production are likely to be greatest in semi-arid regions already constrained by marginal growing conditions. The response of temperate grain crops (wheat, field pea and lentil) to elevated CO2 (eCO2) (550μmolmol−1) under semi-arid field conditions was studied over 11 years in the Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) research program. This review synthesizes key outcomes and implications for crop adaptation in a semi-arid environment. Across all crops and environments, eCO2 increased mean yields (16–58%) compared to current ambient (aCO2) concentrations. Wheat yields increased by 18% and 29% under rainfed and supplemental irrigation, respectively resulting in yield increases of 6.1 (aCO2) and 14.1 (eCO2)kgha−1mm−1 of additional water. Wheat grain [N] declined (~7%) under eCO2 across cultivars, resulting in reduced grain protein and bread baking quality, and this was not reversed by additional fertilizer N. Of several tested crop traits favorable for dryland cropping of wheat under eCO2, a transpiration efficiency trait increased yields under eCO2 representing a path for adaptation in semi-arid environments. The rates and amounts of N2 fixation in legumes were increased by eCO2 but were greater under higher soil water content. Barley yellow dwarf virus incidence increased by 10.6% due to changes in epidemiology under eCO2. Results from AGFACE suggest that maximizing the advantages of eCO2 requires synergistic development of adapted management systems, innovative genetics and removing physiological bottlenecks. This systems approach will increase the potential to maintain agricultural production in new combinations of environments for longer than if changes are piecemeal.

N1  - The 4th International Plant Phenotyping Symposium
N2  - Wheat improvement programs require rapid assessment of large numbers of individual plots across multiple environments. Vegetation indices (VIs) that are mainly associated with yield and yield-related physiological traits, and rapid evaluation of canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can assist in-season selection. Multi-spectral imagery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can readily assess the VIs traits at various crop growth stages. Thirty-two wheat cultivars and breeding lines grown in limited irrigation and full irrigation treatments were investigated to monitor NDVI across the growth cycle using a Sequoia sensor mounted on a UAV. Significant correlations ranging from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 were observed between NDVI detected from UAV and Greenseeker (GS) during stem elongation (SE) to late grain gilling (LGF) across the treatments. UAV-NDVI also had high heritabilities at SE (h2 = 0.91), flowering (F)(h2 = 0.95), EGF (h2 = 0.79) and mid grain filling (MGF) (h2 = 0.71) under the full irrigation treatment, and at booting (B) (h2 = 0.89), EGF (h2 = 0.75) in the limited irrigation treatment. UAV-NDVI explained significant variation in grain yield (GY) at EGF (R2 = 0.86), MGF (R2 = 0.83) and LGF (R2 = 0.89) stages, and results were consistent with GS-NDVI. Higher correlations between UAV-NDVI and GY were observed under full irrigation at three different grain-filling stages (R2 = 0.40, 0.49 and 0.45) than the limited irrigation treatment (R2 = 0.08, 0.12 and 0.14) and GY was calculated to be 24.4% lower under limited irrigation conditions. Pearson correlations between UAV-NDVI and GY were also low ranging from r = 0.29 to 0.37 during grain-filling under limited irrigation but higher than GS-NDVI data. A similar pattern was observed for normalized difference red-edge (NDRE) and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI) when correlated with GY. Fresh biomass estimated at late flowering stage had significant correlations of r = 0.30 to 0.51 with UAV-NDVI at EGF. Some genotypes Nongda 211, Nongda 5181, Zhongmai 175 and Zhongmai 12 were identified as high yielding genotypes using NDVI during grain-filling. In conclusion, a multispectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a reliable high-throughput platform for NDVI measurement to predict biomass and GY and grain-filling stage seems the best period for selection.

N2  - This study addresses the question of whether farms enrolled in land preservation programs are actively engaged in agricultural or conservation activities. Data are drawn from an original survey administered to preserved farm owners in the states of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in 2011. “Actively engaged” is defined as investment in conservation projects, buildings, equipment, or irrigation since the land was preserved. Affirmative answers to the survey's investment questions range from a low of 19% for irrigation to a high of 69% for equipment. Special attention was paid to differences between lifestyle farmers and small and large commercial farmers, which are classified using the USDA typology developed in 2000. Regression analysis estimates differences in investment behavior across these groups as well as farm tenure categories, controlling for farm size, program/state location, and demographic variables. Only owners who employ tenants or managers exclusively on their land were found to invest significantly less than the largest professional farmers, and they did so across all four types of investment. This study's findings support preservation goals articulated by legislators and program administrators, because (1) agricultural and land stewardship investments appear to be widespread on preserved farms, partly due to administrators’ preference for larger parcels, (2) there is no evidence that “hobby farmers” are disproportionately attracted to farmland preservation programs – in fact the opposite seems to be true – while those that exist in our sample behave similarly to the largest commercial farmers, (3) although tenant farming is associated in the sample with lower rates of investment, it is less common on preserved farms than on all farms in the three study states. The matter of land tenure, highlighted in this as in other studies, has not yet become a primary focus of either farm-behavioral research or state agricultural policy.

N2  - A large number of small- to medium-sized community ponds exist in most parts of the Terai region in Nepal. Such ponds could be a viable alternative for other forms of surface irrigation. But, with the lack of efficient management, many of these ponds remain underutilized. An effort was made to facilitate the rehabilitation of such a pond in a selected village of Rupandehi District in Western Terai region of Nepal. This paper aims to evaluate the changed water availability situation in post-monsoon seasons after the pond rehabilitation. The paper also evaluates the feasibility of such interventions especially focusing on the potential to provide additional water and improve agricultural productivity. Results showed small increases in quantifiable indicators such as water availability, cropping intensity, productivity and income. The new institutional setup improved water allocation, improved operation and maintenance, and increased social awareness among the people about the importance of underutilized water resources. The intervention has the potential to be replicated in similar contexts.

N2  - Microcystins are the most common cyanotoxins and may be expected wherever blooms of cyanobacteria occur in surface waters. Their persistence both in the irrigation water and in the soil can lead to their transfer and bioaccumulation into agricultural plants. The aim of this work was to investigate microcystin accumulation in Solanum lycopersicum cultivar MicroTom. The plant was exposed to either Microcystis aeruginosa crude extracts containing up to 100μgeq.MC-LRL−1 in a soil–plant system for 90days or pure radiolabeled 14C-MC-LR in a hydroponic condition for 48h. Toxin bioaccumulation in the soil and different plant tissues was assessed both by the PP2A inhibition assay and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). After 90days of exposure, microcystins persisted in the soil and their free extractable concentrations accumulated were very low varying between 1.6 and 3.9μgeq.MC-LRkg−1 DW. Free MC-LR was detected only in roots and leaves with concentrations varying between 4.5 and 8.1μgkg−1 DW and between 0.29 and 0.55μgkg−1 DW, respectively. By using radioactivity (14C-MC-LR), the results have reported a growing accumulation of toxins within the organs roots>leaves>stems and allowed them to confirm the absence of MC-LR in fruits after 48h of exposure. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was 13.6 in roots, 4.5 in leaves, and 1.4 in stems. On the other hand, the results highlight the presence of two radioactive fractions in different plant tissues. The non-extractable fraction of radioactivity, corresponding to the covalently bound MC-LR, was higher than that of the extractable fraction only in roots and leaves reaching 56% and 71% of the total accumulated toxin, respectively. Therefore, results raise that monitoring programs must monitor the presence of MCs in the irrigation water to avoid the transfer and accumulation of these toxins in crops.

N2  - The increasing frequency and severity of drought pose significant threats to sustainable agricultural production across the world. Managing drought risks is challenging given the complexity of the interdependencies and feedback between climate drivers and socio-economic and ecological systems. To better understand the dynamics that drive the impacts of drought and water scarcity on crop production, a system dynamics model has been developed to explore complex interactions between factors in associated with drought and agricultural production, and examine how these might impact agricultural sustainability, using a case study in a coffee production system in Viet Nam. The model shows that water- and land-use drivers and their interactions with ecological and socio-economic factors play a more significant role than drought in determining the sustainability of coffee production. Results of policy scenario analyses indicate that drought conditions might exacerbate problems related to water shortages for irrigation but their impacts could be substantially minimized through applying intervention strategies, including restriction of the total area of land available for coffee production (to ~ 190,000 ha) and a 25% reduction in the irrigation amount per hectare of coffee compared to the common practices. Overall, the model findings add significant insight into drought and water resources management for sustainable crop production and the developed model can serve as a decision-support tool to inform strategic policy-making.

N2  - CONTEXT: The nitrogen (N) balance provides an indication of the risk for
N losses into the environment. Previous studies have shown large
variation in N balance among producer maize fields in the US Corn Belt,
even within the same region and year. However, little is known about the
soil and management factors explaining variation in N balance and to
what extent the influence of these factors on N balance occurs via grain
yield, N inputs, or both. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to disentangle
interactions among yield, management practices, and soil factors to
identify which have the greatest influence on N balance in producer
maize fields in Nebraska (USA). METHODS: The database used contains
yield and management records from 311 producer irrigated and rainfed
fields sown with maize for two years (2010-2011). The N balance was
estimated as the difference between N inputs (from fertilizer and
applied irrigation) and grain N removal. Random forest regression and
path analysis were used to assess the influence of soil and management
factors on the N balance via either grain yield or N inputs for
irrigated and rainfed fields. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis based on
combination of advanced statistics showed that soil organic matter
(SOM), seeding rate, sowing date, and in-season N sidedress influenced N
balance, mostly via N inputs application and, to a lesser degree, grain
yield. In many cases, producer risk behavior explained the relationship
between N balance and soil and management factors. For example, N
application was higher in fields that have lower SOM or received
in-season N sidedress, without any yield advantage. The findings suggest
that efforts are needed to help producers manage N inputs more
efficiently and deal with the associated risks. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study
performed a novel field level assessment of factors influencing N
balance which provides useful information in prioritization of
agricultural research and extension programs to avoid large N balances
and associated negative environmental impact.

N2  - Accurate estimation of wetting front dimensions in surface and sub-surface irrigation systems is very important for optimal management of water resources as well as increasing the performance of irrigation systems. Analytical and numerical models need lots of computational efforts and costs, so their applications in practical issues might be difficult. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence models could be suitable substitutes for these models. The present study aimed at simulating wetting front (wetting bulb) dimensions in different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation systems using continuous and pulse applications, through the gene expressions programming (GEP) and random forest (RF) techniques. Different experiments were carried out to achieve the required data. A robust k-fold testing data scanning technique was adopted for assessing the applied models, where different criteria were considered for defining the “k” values per test procedure. The results obtained revealed that, with minor exceptions, both the applied GEP and RF models presented good ability in modeling the wetting front dimensions in all the conducted treatments. The results also showed that soil type and emitter installation depth were the best criteria for defining the “k” values of k-fold testing procedure for the surface and sub-surface irrigation systems, respectively.

N2  - An experimental programme is presented with the aim of characterising – from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives – the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarra (Andalusia, Spain), as sealing liners in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the compacted material was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the shear-strength properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material in a wide range of earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the compacted material did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading. Nevertheless, despite the low porosity attained on the dry-side compaction, the material underwent some collapse on soaking at stresses greater than 100kPa.

N2  - To establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in irrigation water, Escherichia coli was enumerated using two quantification methods (plate counts and PMA-qPCR) and presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms, including five strains from the Shiga toxigenic E. coli (O157:H7, O26, O103, O111 and O145) and Salmonella spp. were evaluated. The results confirmed that surface water can be considered a microbial hazard when used for irrigation. The levels of viable E. coli were very similar to those of cultivable E. coli, except for irrigation water obtained from water reservoirs. Comparison between the E. coli counts in samples positive and negative for the presence of pathogenic bacteria for the evaluated water sources identified E. coli level of 2.35 log cfu/100 mL as a cut-off able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93% sensitivity and 66% specificity, respectively. Thus, for the samples with levels of E. coli under 2.35 log cfu/100 mL (e.g., 2.24 log cfu/100 mL) there was a 90% probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism in locations with similar prevalence. E. coli levels in irrigation water were affected by the ambient temperature confirming that water source and climate conditions should be taken into account by growers when designing a sampling program and the frequency of the monitoring to make a better and more efficient use of their resources.

N2  - Irrigation canals waste some of the water during the conveyance and distribution process. Due to the effect of water losses on distribution planning and operation process, it is necessary to estimate the conveyance efficiency and water losses. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the performance of water conveyance in all level of canals and to carry out an in-depth analysis of the water losses problem in the irrigation schemes through a case study. Therefore, the recorded data in more than 40 selected points of the main, secondary and tertiary canals were analyzed. The use of ultrasonic flowmeter in this study provided an appropriate precision for determining seepage losses and water conveyance efficiency. Results show that conveyance efficiency for main, secondary, and tertiary canals in the 1000 m reaches are 95%, 91.5%, and 89.3% respectively. In addition, the amount of seepage losses per unit of seepage surface for main, secondary, and tertiary canals is equal to 1.22, 1.18, and 0.63 m3/day respectively. Regarding the length of the canals, the total amount of seepage losses in a certain time and in an irrigation interval, in tertiary canals is more than secondary and in secondary canals is more than the main canal. In order to decrease the seepage losses, it is recommended to consider the serious preventive and corrective maintenance programs.

N2  - Water scarcity has been a crucial issue for sustainable irrigated agriculture in the arid regions. In these regions where conserving water is paramount, optimal allocation and utilization of irrigation water is particularly important. In this study, a process-based regional economic optimization (PBREOP) model was developed for maximizing irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefit of an irrigation system. The PBREOP model is a two-level optimization model with combined use of an agro-hydrological model (SWAP-EPIC). The first level (farm scale) dealt with the optimal distribution of irrigation water and cropping pattern considering various crops and soils in a subsystem, using a non-linear programing technique. The second level (district scale) sought out the optimal strategy for irrigation water allocation among different subsystems using a dynamic programing algorithm. The crop water production functions (CWPFs) were an important component of the first-level objective function. They were derived with the SWAP-EPIC model considering different irrigation alternatives. The model was solved using the decomposition-harmonization method for large systems. The Yingke Irrigation District (YID) in the middle Heihe River basin, Northwest China was used as a case to test the PBREOP model. Nine CWPFs for three major crops and three major soils were firstly derived based on the simulations of different irrigation levels and climate conditions (20 years). Next, the PBREOP model for YID was established with 11 subsystems, and applied to the irrigation water use optimization under five water supply scenarios. Results showed that the total economic benefit in YID could be increased by 15% on average through the optimization of water allocation and cropping pattern with the same water supply amount as that of the current situation. A variation range of the risk was also obtained with considering the impacts of climate uncertainties. Scenario analysis showed that the total irrigation water could be reduced by 23% on average without benefit reduction when compared to the benefit of the present situation. Model test indicated that the proposed PBREOP model can efficiently optimize irrigation water use and cropping pattern on a regional scale.

N2  - In order to reduce the soil erosion rate on the Chinese Loess Plateau, the Chinese government launched in 1999 the “Grain for Green” program (GfG). The objective of this program was to increase the forest cover on steep slopes in the landscape by planting trees and sowing grasses on former cropland. The program was a massive investment by the Chinese government. By the end of 2005 the GfG-program was implemented in an area of 87,000km2 in which about 400–600 million trees were planted. At present it is not known to what extent this program was successful. This paper examines the effects of the GfG-program on the mean annual vegetation cover in the Shaanxi province. A decadal time series of SPOT VEGETATION imagery from 1998 till 2005 were used to calculate NDVI-values in four counties with different rainfall regimes. By means of a regression between preceding rainfall and NDVI-values the effects of rainfall variability were filtered out. A trend analysis of the corrected NDVI time series pointed out that the GfG-program resulted in a significant increase of the vegetation cover on farmland in the northern part of Shaanxi province. In the southern part of the province, which has a more humid climate and large areas of irrigation farmland no significant increase of the vegetation cover on farmland could be detected.

N2  - Irrigation as a climate-smart practice in agriculture is identified as a strategy accompanying the transformation witnessed where the dryland community is transitioning from pastoralism to agro-pastoralism. This community is learning and nurturing new adaptation strategies to adapt to the diminishing yet crucial natural resources. This article identifies the socio-economic factors that encourage or hinder the uptake of irrigation as an adaptation strategy among the dryland community in Laikipia County, Kenya. The Heckman probit model is used first, to assess a total of 494 household on how they perceive climate change, and secondly it identifies the drivers that either encourage these households or hinder them from adopting irrigation as an adaptation strategy. Results indicate that 80% of the households investigated experience the indicators of climate change, out of this, 32% adopted irrigation as an adaptation strategy to climatic changes among other livelihood changes. The drivers encouraging this uptake are identified as: quality of land for food production (1.152∗∗), assistance received from government (0.906∗∗), large livestock herd size, governance of community land tenure (1.556∗∗) and agronomic information (1.094∗∗∗). There is low possibility of adopting irrigation by older household heads (−0.0219∗) and those with small livestock herds (−0.473∗). The sustainable development of agriculture promoted in these dryland regions requires a broader policy response that looks at the sustainability of irrigation as an adaption strategy in the dryland.

N2  - Sustainable management of land and water resources in arid and semi-arid regions is of concern as a result of increased population pressure and the need for more food and fiber. Soil and water salinity is widespread across the arid and semi-arid regions of South Asia, Central Asia, Arabian Peninsula, and North Africa and affected agricultural productivity and livelihood of rural population. While natural processes (primary) and anthropogenic activities (secondary) cause salinity, the latter contributed more to agricultural productivity losses in these regions. Recent estimates suggest that up to 50% of irrigated land has become saline in these regions. However, there is cautious optimism for managing salt-affected soils and saline waters for crop and animal production and protection of soil and water resources through research-based interventions using integrated soil–water–plant management practices. The successful use of salt-affected soils and saline water takes the pressure off using freshwater for irrigation. Significant promises for addressing soil and water salinity through an integrated approach include: (1) the use of salt-tolerant crops, forages, and halophytes for human and animal consumption and bio-fuel production, (2) development of agro-forestry through planting forage crops within the interspaces of salt-tolerant trees that co-exist with forage crops and salt-tolerant shrubs, (3) development of appropriate surface and subsurface drainage systems to remove excess water and salt from the soil, (4) alternate and/or blended use of saline and fresh water to minimize salt accumulation in the soil, and (5) maintenance of proper irrigation scheduling to ensure that adequate water is available for crop growth and at the same time removal of excess salt from crop-rooting zone. Monitoring the effectiveness of the above mentioned technologies is important for maximizing the benefits. Finally, appropriate policy and institutional interventions that encourage the general community to accept the technology are required. Isotopic and nuclear techniques play a key role in developing and monitoring the technology for the sustainable use of salt-affected soils and saline waters and protect land and water resources.

N2  - The Gujarat state government had banned further extraction of groundwater and new electricity connection for agricultural purposes in 57 sub-districts, where over-exploitation of groundwater was observed, in 2001, and these regions were demarcated as dark zone in 2003. The micro-irrigation adopted farmers in these regions are entitled to get additional 10 per cent subsidy since 2012, and concurrently, the ban on new electricity connection was also withdrawn. In particular, adoption of micro-irrigation is mandatory for availing new power connection. Both of them could lead to a large-scale diffusion, and as a result, reducing pressure on groundwater extraction. Although various agricultural interventions are being incentivized in India, there is limited studies with respect to assessing its' impact on farmers' adoption behaviour. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate effect of the above said incentives (subsidy and power connection) on diffusion of micro-irrigation in the dark zone regions. Information on the diffusion of micro-irrigation, i.e., drip and sprinkler irrigation, between 2006-07 and 2014 were collected for 8073 villages and towns, combining both dark zone (treated sample) and its adjacent non dark zone talukas (control group). The empirical analysis was performed for three different samples: (i) full sample, (ii) villages along the administrative boundary line drawn between the dark zone and adjacent talukas, i.e., border villages, and (iii) pair-wise border villages; expected to get robust estimation in the latter two cases as there could be no significant difference with respect to hydrological scenario and cropping patterns. Employing ordinary Least Square fixed effects model, results reveal that these policies are positively influencing diffusion of micro-irrigation. A pecuniary benefits and power connection together, for example, enhance the likelihood of incremental adoption rate by 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent and area installed with micro-irrigation technologies between 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent. This study, henceforth, supports the continuation of present incentive policies to further heightening diffusion of such technologies, and this approach could be replicated in the case other resource efficient technologies as minimizing water and energy footprints are always a policy priority.

N2  - This study presents an optimization model for the allocation of
agricultural water and land resources under uncertainty. The model
incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, fuzzy credibility-constrained
programming, mixed-integer non-linear programming, and multi-objective
programming into a general framework. The model is capable of (1)
balancing the trade-off among economic, environmental, and social
considerations in an irrigated agricultural system; (2) optimally
allocating limited agricultural water and land resources simultaneously;
and (3) dealing with the complexities of non-linearity and fuzzy
uncertainties concurrently occurring in both parameters and constraints
to objectively reflect practical issues in agricultural water and land
resources allocations. The developed model is applied to a real case
study in northeast China. The net system benefits, global warming
potential, water pollution, resource allocation equity, and agricultural
water and land allocation schemes among different subareas in different
crop growth periods are obtained under various scenarios. The
performance of the model is assessed with alternative schemes. The model
can help decision makers realize how much confidence one can have in the
optimal solutions and manage agricultural water and land resources in a
more efficient and environment-friendly way.

N2  - The conversion of marginal croplands to tree plantations, as an option to address climate change, land degradation, and irrigation water scarcity, as well as to improve the welfare of local population requires prior analysis. This study analyzed the impacts of afforestation of marginal croplands, including potential benefits in the form of carbon sequestration rewards via the Clean Development Mechanism, on the livelihood of commercial farms and rural households by considering their interdependencies via wage-labor relations in irrigated agricultural regions of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River, Central Asia. A dynamic nonlinear programming model was developed that jointly maximizes profit of farm and net incomes of rural households over a 15-year horizon under conditions of decreasing irrigation water availability and forestry plantations with a single seven-year rotation period. The results showed that the introduction of short-rotation plantation forestry in degraded irrigated croplands can help mitigate the repercussions of water shortages on rural livelihood, while sustaining energy needs, income, and food security. Although income and food consumption of rural households may decline from year two to six after afforestation, the subsequent increase in farm profit following the harvest of tree plantations would be transmitted to rural households through existing wage-labor payment arrangements. The incorporation of fuelwood into labor payment schemes would substitute the use of fossil fuels by rural households and thus substantially decrease their energy expenses and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, given the low irrigation water demand of trees, afforestation would increase irrigation water availability for more productive croplands.

N2  - This paper argues about some performance criteria in irrigation schemes according to the situation of before and after irrigation management transfer in Turkey. Irrigation management transfer is defined as the transfer of authority and responsibility to manage irrigation systems from government agencies to water users organizations. Irrigation management transfer is a reform which has been strongly supported by Turkey’s government as they realize greater participation of farmers in the management of irrigation systems. This is a monitoring and evaluation study which are the methods for assessing the performance of interventions, in this case the transfer of irrigation management from government to users. Many positive effects have been realized by the transfer process of irrigation management in Turkey. Initial results of the transfer included a doubling of irrigation fee collection rates and a shifting of operation and maintenance expenditures from the public to the users, an accumulation of reserves in some irrigation associations for future capital purchases, a reduced wage for operation and maintenance personnel, and indications of expansions of irrigated area in some transferred schemes.

N2  - In the last decade, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia faced a severe drought which affected its agriculture production. Sustainable diversion limits as proposed in the Australian Government's basin plan together with climate change are expected to impact on future agriculture production and development in the MDB. We developed a biophysical-economic mathematical model calibrated against the observed multi-period land use data utilising the positive mathematical programming (PMP) approach to evaluate the impacts on agricultural production activities of a range of climate events and policy options. This is an extension of our previous work where the model was calibrated against a single year and the focus was on the southern MDB only. The multi-period calibrated model has strong predictive capacity as it matches simulated irrigated area, water use and gross value of irrigated agricultural product (GVIAP) well with the observed irrigated land, water use and GVIAP for all the crops in all the regions of the MDB across the highly variable climatic conditions from 2005 to 2009. The approach will be useful in assessing economic impacts of climate change on irrigation, farmers' adaptation options and/or water policies including water markets and irrigation efficiency improvement. © 2014 .

N2  - Awareness of increasing water scarcity has driven efforts to model global water resources for improved insight into water resources infrastructure and management strategies. Most water resources models focus explicitly on water systems and represent socio-economic and environmental change as external drivers. In contrast, the system dynamics-based integrated assessment model employed here, ANEMI, incorporates dynamic representations of these systems, so that their broader changes affect and are affected by water resources systems through feedbacks. Sectors in ANEMI therefore include the global climate system, carbon cycle, economy, population, land use and agriculture, and novel versions of the hydrological cycle, global water use and water quality. Since the model focus is on their interconnections through explicit nonlinear feedbacks, simulations with ANEMI provide insight into the nature and structure of connections between water resources and socio-economic and environmental change. Of particular interest to water resources researchers and modelers will be the simulated effects of a new water stress definition that incorporates both water quality and water quantity effects into the measurement of water scarcity. Five simulation runs demonstrate the value of wastewater treatment and reuse programs and the feedback-effects of irrigated agriculture and greater consumption of animal products.

N2  - Does irrigation infrastructure lead to trust, and how does this happen? We approach these questions by testing two processes of trust formation: particularized trust built on repeated interactions of rational individuals and generalized trust based on arational habits. To identify the causal relationship between farmers’ irrigation infrastructure access and trust, we conducted an incentivized trust game with beneficiaries of the irrigated land settlement program in rural Sri Lanka, where land allocation was arguably random. Two findings emerged. First, trust among community members monotonically increases with each farmer's years of access to irrigation, regardless of social relationships. Second, the nexus between irrigation access years and trust does not necessarily differ between in-group and out-group members. These findings suggest the relative significance of generalized trust formation by habits in irrigated communities, although we cannot fully rule out the possible particularized trust formation through repeated interactions. Since generalized trust is essential to facilitate market transactions, our finding is especially relevant when formulating infrastructure investment policies in developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar, is a major pest of stone and pome fruit (e.g., apples, pears, peaches, cherries, etc.). Entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema spp. and Heterorhabditis spp.) are virulent to ground-dwelling stages of C. nenuphar and may be incorporated into an integrated management strategy. Two significant questions that must be addressed prior to implementation are: (1) which nematode is most effective in suppressing the target pest under field conditions? and (2) what is the impact of various irrigation levels on field efficacy? We addressed these questions by comparing the efficacy of two nematodes, Steinernema riobrave and Steinernema feltiae (two nematodes that showed the highest virulence in prior lab assays and field trials) and an untreated control, at three irrigation levels 0, 1 and 6 irrigation events applied during a two-week period post-application. C. nenuphar larvae were added to mini-plots prior to treatment application. Treatment effects were assessed by comparing the number of C. nenuphar adults emerging from each plot. The experiments were conducted at two field sites (apple orchards in Kearneysville, West Virginia and Belchertown, Massachusetts) in 2011 and 2012. Relative to the untreated check, S. riobrave caused 85.0% and 97.3% control in 2011 and 2012 in Massachusetts (respectively) and 100% control in West Virginia both years, whereas S. feltiae caused 0% and 84.6% control in 2011 and 2012 (respectively) in Massachusetts, and 78.2% and 69.7% control in West Virginia. The level of C. nenuphar suppression caused by S. riobrave was higher than suppression by S. feltiae at both sites in 2011 (no differences were detected in 2012). Irrigation did not have a significant effect on C. nenuphar suppression at both sites and in both years of the experiments. The lack of irrigation effects is an unusual finding for field applications using entomopathogenic nematodes, and may have been due to the level of precipitation and water-holding capacity in the field soils tested. The results of this study have positive implications for the potential of incorporating entomopathogenic nematodes into a C. nenuphar management program.

N2  - Intensive irrigated rice–wheat production systems have converted the north-west Indo-Gangetic Plains into South Asia's cereal basket. Their strategic importance is undermined by a slowdown in productivity growth linked to the degradation of soil and water resources. Findings from farm surveys are used to examine contrasts and similarities between rice and wheat farms, cultivation practices, productivity, and profitability in the rice–wheat belt of India's Haryana State and Pakistan's Punjab province. In Haryana average wheat and paddy yields are markedly higher, but the yield advantage is offset by higher total production costs, resulting in lower private returns. The diverging institutional environment including varying levels of intervention in produce and input markets contributed to the evolution of the Pakistani production model as relatively ‘medium input–medium output’ and the Indian production model as ‘high input–high output’. The study reiterates the need to reinvigorate productivity growth and to reduce production costs in these intensive cereal production systems while conserving natural resources such as water and limiting negative environmental impacts. The study however also raises questions about the future of current rice–wheat systems.

N2  - Summary
This study employed a Monte-Carlo simulation approach to characterise the uncertainties in climate change induced variations in storage requirements and performance (reliability (time- and volume-based), resilience, vulnerability and sustainability) of surface water reservoirs. Using a calibrated rainfall–runoff (R–R) model, the baseline runoff scenario was first simulated. The R–R inputs (rainfall and temperature) were then perturbed using plausible delta-changes to produce simulated climate change runoff scenarios. Stochastic models of the runoff were developed and used to generate ensembles of both the current and climate-change-perturbed future runoff scenarios. The resulting runoff ensembles were used to force simulation models of the behaviour of the reservoir to produce ‘populations’ of required reservoir storage capacity to meet demands, and the performance. Comparing these parameters between the current and the perturbed provided the population of climate change effects which was then analysed to determine the variability in the impacts. The methodology was applied to the Pong reservoir on the Beas River in northern India. The reservoir serves irrigation and hydropower needs and the hydrology of the catchment is highly influenced by Himalayan seasonal snow and glaciers, and Monsoon rainfall, both of which are predicted to change due to climate change. The results show that required reservoir capacity is highly variable with a coefficient of variation (CV) as high as 0.3 as the future climate becomes drier. Of the performance indices, the vulnerability recorded the highest variability (CV up to 0.5) while the volume-based reliability was the least variable. Such variabilities or uncertainties will, no doubt, complicate the development of climate change adaptation measures; however, knowledge of their sheer magnitudes as obtained in this study will help in the formulation of appropriate policy and technical interventions for sustaining and possibly enhancing water security for irrigation and other uses served by Pong reservoir.

N2  - The management of water resources among competing uses presents a complex technical and policy challenge. Integrated hydro-economic models capable of simulating the hydrologic system in irrigated and non-irrigated regions including the response of farmers to hydrologic constraints and economic and policy incentives, provide a framework to understand biophysical and socioeconomic implications of changing water availability. We present a transformative hydro-economic model of agricultural production driven by multi-sensor satellite observations, outputs from regional climate models, and socioeconomic data. Our approach overcomes the limitations of current decision support systems for agricultural water management and provides policymakers and natural resource managers with satellite data-driven, state-wide, operational models capable of anticipating how farmers allocate water, land, and other resources when confronted with new climate patterns, policy rules, or market signals. The model can also quantify how farming decisions affect agricultural water supplies. We demonstrate the model through an application in the state of Montana.

N1  - Preparing Rice for a Water-Limited Future: from Molecular to Regional Scale.International Rice Research Congress
N2  - Australian rice growers are under considerable pressure to increase water use efficiency to remain profitable and avoid soil salinisation. In particular, profitability is threatened by decreasing water availability and certainty of supply and by increasing water price, as a result of environmental and National Competition Policy agendas. Field irrigation water productivity has more than doubled in the past 20 years from an average of around 0.34g paddy rice per kg water to around 0.77gkg−1, largely due to increased yield from the development and adoption of improved varieties and management strategies, and to a lesser degree due to the introduction of rice water use and soil suitability policies. Future increases in rice field water productivity will come from greater yields through breeding for increased cold tolerance, precision agriculture and improved crop establishment, and from reduced water use due to reduced duration of ponding. A key challenge of the next decade will be to increase cold tolerance to the extent that deep water ponding for low temperature protection is no longer required, possibly allowing a complete shift away from ponded culture and reducing irrigation water requirement. While increasing the water productivity of rice is important, water productivity and profitability of the entire cropping system is of ultimate importance. Growing winter crops after rice and permanent bed systems offer potential benefits of increased productivity of crops traditionally grown in rotation with rice and increased cropping diversity and flexibility. Irrigation water productivity is also being improved through on-farm and regional technologies such as on-farm recycling systems and automatic data acquisition and control systems in irrigation supply systems. To increase water use efficiency and achieve sustainability of rice-based farming systems in Australia, irrigation communities are implementing a range of on-farm and regional technologies and policies. An integrated approach is required to evaluate options, prioritise investments, maximise economic returns, guide policy and balance the environmental demands of river ecosystems with the needs of irrigated agriculture and its dependent regional communities. Significant progress is being made, through the development and application of farm and irrigation area hydrologic models linked with production models and economics, combined with strong stakeholder participation. The progress in integrating science, people and policy makers was recognised in 2002 by the award of the first “Reference” catchment status to the lower Murrumbidgee catchment, a major Australian rice-growing region, under the UNESCO/WMO HELP (Hydrology for Environment, Life and Policy) program.

N2  - Intercropping and drip irrigation with plastic mulch are two agricultural practices used worldwide. Coupling of these two practices may further increase crop yields and land and water use efficiencies when an optimal spatial distribution of soil water contents (SWC), soil temperatures, and plant roots is achieved. However, this coupling causes the distribution of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots to be more complex than when only one of these agricultural practices are used. The objective of this study thus was to investigate the effects of different irrigation treatments on spatial distributions of SWCs, soil temperatures, and root growth in a drip-irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch. Three field experiments with different irrigation treatments (high T1, moderate T2, and low T3) were conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots with respect to dripper lines and plant locations. There were significant differences (p<0.05) in SWCs in the 0–40cm soil layer for different irrigation treatments and between different locations. The maximum SWC was measured under the plant/mulch for the T1 treatment, while the minimum SWC was measured under the bare soil surface for the T3 treatment. This was mainly due to the location of drippers and mulch. However, no differences in SWCs were measured in the 60100cm soil layer. Significant differences in soil temperatures were measured in the 05cm soil layer between different irrigation treatments and different locations. The soil temperature in the subsoil (1525cm) under mulch was higher than under the bare surface. The overlaps of two plant root systems in an intercropping field gradually increased and then decreased during the growing season. The roots in the 030cm soil layer accounted for about 60%70% of all roots. Higher irrigation rates produced higher root length and weight densities in the 030cm soil layer and lower densities in the 30100cm soil layers. Spatial distributions of SWCs, soil temperatures, and plant roots in the intercropping field under drip irrigation were significantly influenced by irrigation treatments and plastic mulch. Collected experimental data may contribute to designing an optimal irrigation program for a drip-irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch.

N2  - The purpose of this research was to characterize the quality of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in Blantyre, Malawi as well as identify some geochemical processes governing mineralization of major and some minor elements. The aquifer studied is part of the extensive crystalline basement complex. The suitability and classification involved confirmatory analysis of the results with World Health Organization and Malawi Standards Board groundwater guideline values. The water samples were analyzed for major descriptors (pH, Temperature, turbidity, major ions, total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity (EC), using standard methods. Besides, arsenic, iron and fluoride were analyzed as well. Multivariate statistics (especially Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Factor Analysis), hydrographical methods (i.e. Piper diagram) and geochemical modeling programs (AquaChem and PHREEQC) were used to characterize the quality and explain the sources and evolution of groundwater. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation was assessed using Wilcox method which identified BH01, BH16 and BH21 as high salinity areas. Incidentally, the three boreholes had relatively higher sulfate and nitrate concentrations than the rest. Nevertheless, the groundwater was found to be within acceptable limits for drinking quality except elevated concentrations of nitrate, fluoride and iron in some boreholes compared with WHO standards, despite meeting the national standards. Borehole BH01, BH02, BH07, BH13 and BH18 exhibited nitrate concentrations greater than national standards (45 mg/L) an indication of groundwater contamination. Furthermore, the groundwater is slightly acidic to slightly above neutral with total dissolved solids less than 500 mg/l. Generally, groundwater was undersaturated with respect to both calcite and dolomite while oversaturated with respect to halite, goethite and hematite. Silicate and carbonate weathering were identified as main mineral sources for major ions in groundwater. There is a dire need for more studies and monitoring of the groundwater in this area to safeguard the resource and human health.

N2  - This study analyzes the environmental performance of two centralized clean coal technologies and localized biogas digester, biomass gasifier and a solar PV by joint use of life cycle assessment (LCA) and emergy analysis. We also calculate cost of electricity generation by each of these technologies. The resulting information is utilized to determine the optimum energy mix to meet the energy demand in Rampura Village, Uttar Pradesh, India by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. The LP problem is processed in two steps: first, it is solved for four scenarios involving different practical situations and constraints. After determining the suitable scenario, the optimum energy combination within this scenario is found. The scenario and energy combination analyses reveal that performing 70% of cooking by biogas cook stoves, 30% by improved biomass cook stoves in the traditional way, and converting rest of biogas to electricity to meet irrigation and lighting energy needs is the most environmentally benign, economically feasible and socially attractive option for the village. Direct utilization of biogas for cooking makes it possible to meet all the energy demand in Rampura with local resources. Importing energy from erratic and unreliable government grid is not needed, hence energy security and reliability are ensured. Additionally, the GHG and other emissions related to cooking with inefficient stoves are also significantly mitigated (88%) through the use of biogas and improved biomass cook stoves. Energy projection through 2031 to determine changing energy patterns in the project site shows that there will be enough biogas for cooking needs in Rampura until 2031. However, by 2016, the total energy demand (cooking+irrigation+lighting) will exceed what can be met with only biogas. Then either biogas potential will need to increase or electricity will have to come from biomass or solar resources. If these local sources of energy are not enough, importing energy from centralized energy options will be necessary. Thus, increasing energy demand in developing countries will necessitate utilization of centralized energy options even in rural areas. Utilizing centralized clean coal technologies to meet this demand could ease energy related environmental problems. Alternatively, if rural development can take place without rampant consumerism and energy-intensive lifestyles, then satisfying local needs with local resources with minimum environmental impact is much more likely.

N2  - Drained agriculturally used peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). To reduce GHG emissions and simultaneously maintain intensive grassland use, raising water levels by subsurface irrigation (SI) is controversially discussed. Both, intensive grassland use and installations of SI may require grassland renewal. We investigated an experimental intervention site (INT) (SI target water levels: -0.30 m) and a deeply drained reference site (REF), both intensive grassland on deep bog peat. After installation of the SI system, a mechanical grassland renewal took place at INT. At both sites, CO2 (eddy covariance), N2O and methane (manual closed chamber technique) were measured. Additionally, soil water was analyzed for nitrogen species. Here, we report on the initial year of GHG measurements including grassland renewal and rising water levels. Overall, GHG emissions were strongly influenced by grassland renewal at INT. Despite progressively rising water levels, soil moisture in the upper centimeters was low and thus grass growth was slow, resulting in an almost complete loss of harvest. This resulted in a net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of 4.64 ± 1.03 t C ha−1 containing only 0.57 ± 0.09 t C ha−1 harvest at INT, while NECB at REF was 6.08 ± 1.74 t C ha−1 including harvest from five grass cuts. Methane fluxes were negligible at both sites. Nitrous oxide emissions dominated the GHG balance at INT. With 144.5 ± 45.5 kg N2O–N ha–1 a–1, they were much higher than at REF (3.9 ± 3.1 kg N2O–N ha–1 a–1) and any other values published so far. Peak fluxes occurred when nitrate concentrations in soil water were extremely high, soil moisture was increased, and vegetation development was struggling. This study highlights the risk of grassland renewals on peat soils regarding yield losses as well as high GHG emissions.

N2  - Groundwater overdraft due to extensive irrigation has led to a shallow aquifer depletion crisis in the Haihe River basin. Quantitative simulation of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different conditions of limited exploitation using a distributed hydrological model is important in the well-irrigated plain of this basin. Based on multiple modeling experiments by a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were selected as simulation scenarios. The simulated results using the SWAT model showed that under scenario 1 (applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 2/3 of that under the basic scenario (current irrigation schedule), but the winter wheat yield decreased by 13% compared with the basic scenario. Under scenario 2 (applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat), the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 1/4 of that under the basic scenario, but the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario increased to 28%. The amount of overexploited shallow groundwater in the cropland area decreased from 17.5 × 108 m3 a−1 (under the basic scenario) to 11.0 × 108 m3 a−1 under scenario 1 and 4.5 × 108 m3 a−1 under scenario 2. Under scenario 3 (rain-fed conditions during the winter wheat season), the regional variation in the shallow groundwater table shifted to a recovery trend with an average rate of 0.22 m a−1, which was equivalent to restoring 3.5 × 108 m3 a−1 of shallow aquifer storage in the cropland area. However, the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario reached 54% under the rain-fed scheme. Considering the trade-off between groundwater conservation and crop production under limited exploitation, linear programming was used to optimize the irrigation schedule at the subbasin scale. As a result, to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown, the average minimal reduction in the winter wheat yield would be 42% under the optimal irrigation schedule. By contrast, to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the threshold required to maintain winter wheat self-sufficiency, the minimal rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table would be 0.26–0.52 m a−1 under the optimal irrigation schedule. In addition, the uncertainty in the simulated shallow groundwater variation in this study was acceptable, indicating that the above assessments could provide reasonable references for regional groundwater management.

N2  - An interval linear multi-objective programming (ILMP) model for irrigation water allocation was developed, considering conflicting objectives and uncertainties. Based on the generation of interval numbers through statistical simulation, the ILMP model was solved using a fuzzy programming method. The model balances contradictions among economic net benefit, crop yield and water-saving in irrigation systems incorporating uncertainties in both objective functions and constraints that are based on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. The model was applied to Hulan River irrigation district, northeast China. Tradeoffs between various crops in different subareas under different frequencies were analyzed, and scenarios with different objectives were considered to evaluate the changing trend of irrigation water allocation.Results indicated that the ILMP model provided effective linkages between revenue/output promotion and water saving, and offers insights into tradeoffs for irrigation water management under uncertainty.

N2  - Lack of water and increase in ambient temperature, caused by climate change, are already affecting agriculture worldwide. These factors will affect the physiology and development of plants in general, including blueberry plants (Vaccinium spp.). With this in mind, six cultivars of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) (‘Star’, ‘Bluecrisp’, ‘Jewel’, ‘Bluegold’, ‘Elliott’ and ‘Liberty’) and two rabbiteye cvs. (Vaccinium ashei R.) (‘Bonita’ and ‘Powderblue’) were subjected to two water treatments: continuous irrigation (Full irrigation–FI); and with a water deficit (only one third of the volume of water, water deficit–WD). Both treatments were applied in two greenhouses one of which represented ambient conditions (At) and the other simulated heat stress conditions (At+10°C). Measurements were made of chlorophyll fluorescence, stem water potential (Ψs), chlorophyll content, leaf temperature and SPAD. In At conditions, cultivars showed differences in most parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence, but only the quantum yield of energy conversion of non-photochemical quenching (Y(NPQ)) and Ψs were significant, along with interactions between cultivars and irrigation treatments. In addition, cultivars differed in the maximum rate of electron transport (ETRmax), IK and effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)), indicating differences in the efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). Under At+10°C conditions, there were significant interactions in the minimum fluorescence in the dark-adapted state (F0), ETRmax, IK, Y(II), Ψs and photochemical quenching (qP and qL). Thus indicating that when subjected to the two combined stresses (WD−At+10°C) the cultivars showed different responses in the efficiency and operation of PSII. The results of this study indicate that the fluorescence parameters provide a good tool for phenotyping in blueberry breeding programs and enable the detection and elimination of unwanted genotypes at the beginning of the selection process.

N2  - Study region
The study was carried out at community scale watershed in one of the fragile ecologies of Central India.
Study focus
This paper quantifies the impact of rainwater management (RWM) interventions on major water balance components, irrigation use, crop intensification and energy consumption and their interrelationships.
New hydrological insights for the region
RWM interventions harvested additional 35 mm of surface runoff in various masonry structures and facilitated groundwater recharge from 720 mm rainfall received. The net groundwater recharge during monsoon season was estimated 75−80 mm; out of this, 25 % (15−20 mm) was used in kharif and 75 % (50−60 mm) in rabi season. Groundwater recharge largely took place in wet and normal years due to RWM interventions, which supported for meeting freshwater demand in recurring dry years. Increased groundwater recharge helped to enhance cropping intensity from 120 % to 180 % by converting significant fallow lands into productive cultivation. The time required to refill dug wells decreased by 50 % with every one meter increment in hydraulic head. Therefore, well recovery period reduced minimum by 50 % after the project interventions. The study shows a huge untapped potential for sustainable crop intensification by adopting science-based natural resource management approach in fragile eco regions of the semi-arid tropics.

N2  - The viability and seed dormancy of the critically endangered species Astragalus nitidiflorus were tested during eight consecutive years (2006–2013) in order to determine if the high physical seed dormancy described in a previous study is affected by annual or seasonal environmental conditions. Also, the effects of maternal factors – such as fruit position in the inflorescence or seed position in the fruit, the age of the mother plants, and water stress – on seed viability and dormancy were tested. In order to determine the variation in the degree of germinability between years, ripe seeds were harvested each July from 2006 to 2013 and their viability and dormancy were tested. Moreover, in 2013 new seeds were collected to check the effects of the maternal factors mentioned above. A trial with potted plant in greenhouse was performed to corroborate the observed field data about the effect of water stress suffered by the mother plant on seed dormancy. The results show a high variability over the years in the physical dormancy of A. nitidiflorus seeds because maternal environmental factors such as drought or mother plant age influence the proportion of seeds that enter dormancy. This in turn determines the proportion of seed that becomes part of the seed bank each year and also the age structure of the natural population. The conservation programs for this critically endangered species should consider these results to implement measures to prevent the extinction of the species.

N2  - Brazil is one of the top world producers of the staple commodity common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Irregular distribution of rainfall and the lack of rain during the crop reproductive phases affect its yield and increase the demand of water for irrigation. However, in recent years, water resources have decreased and water saving has become an issue. Thus, soil management techniques, which reduce evaporation, and efficient irrigation programming, through the monitoring of soil water content, could be adopted in water scarcity scenarios. This study assesses the effect of crop residues management (incorporated IR or left on soil surface NR) in soil water availability (and its retention in the soil pore space), and yield in common beans cultivated under no-till and directly seeded in an irrigated farm located southwest of São Paulo state. Soil water content was monitored with TDR probes installed within the 0–20cm layer and its retention was assessed through the soil water retention curve. For the same irrigation management, the IR led to soil water content was lower than NR but both soil managements had similar available water and their demand of water for irrigation was similar. For the same soil water content, NR soils could hold it tightly in the pore space and the root plant system would require higher energy to absorb it. Then, it is foreseen that the root system in IR soils will be shallower than in NR soils, since it will withdraw water easily within the first 20cm, however, in NR, the roots will extend deeper searching for available water. Considering 40kPa as a threshold value, the plants suffered water stress during all crop cycle at the same physiologic stages in both soils. The variables studied to assess yield presented no-statistical significance in the T test at significance level of 0.05.

N2  - The present study argues that there are heterogeneous farm systems within the drylands and each farm system is unique in terms of its livelihood asset and agricultural practice, and therefore in sustainability. Our method is based on household survey data collected from 500 farmers in Anantapur and Kurnool Districts, in Andhra Pradesh State of India, in 2013. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent hierarchical clustering methods to build farm typologies. To evaluate sustainability across these farm typologies, we adopted a framework consisting of economic, social and environmental sustainability pillars and associated indicators. We normalized values of target indicators and employed normative approach to assign different weights to these indicators. Composite sustainability indices (CSI) were then estimated by means of weighted sum of indicators, aggregated and integrated into farm typologies. The results suggested that there were five distinct farm typologies representing farming systems in the study area. The majority of farms (>70%) in the study area are small and extensive (typology 1); marginal and off farm based (typology 2). About 20% of the farms are irrigation based and intensive (typology 3); small and medium and off farm based (typology 4) and irrigation based semi-intensive (typology 5). There was apparent variability among farm typologies in terms of farm structure and functions and composite sustainability indices. Farm typologies 3 and 5 showed significantly higher performances for the social and economic indices, while typologies 2 and 4 had relatively stronger values for environment. These discrepancies support the relevance of integrated farm typology- and CSI approaches in assessing system sustainability and targeting technologies. Universally, for all farm typologies, composite sustainability indices for economic pillar was significantly lower than the social and environment pillars. More than 90% of farmers were in economically less-sustainable class. The correlations between sustainability indices for economic and environment were typology specific. It was strong and positive when aggregated for the whole study systems [all samples (r=0.183; P<0.001)] and for agriculture dependent farm typologies (e.g. typologies 1 and 3). This suggests the need to elevate farms economic performance and capacitate them to invest in the environment. These results provide information for policy makers to plan farm typology–context technological interventions and also create baseline information to evaluate sustainability performance in terms of progress made over time.

N2  - Accurate assessment of temporal changes in gross primary production (GPP) is important for carbon budget assessments and evaluating the impact of climate change on crop productivity. The objective of this study was to devise a simple remote sensing-based GPP model to quantify daily GPP of maize. In the model, (1) daily shortwave radiation (SW), derived from the reanalysis data (North American Land Data Assimilation System; NLDAS-2) and (2) smoothed Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data, derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations were used as proxy variables of the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the total canopy chlorophyll content, respectively. The model was calibrated and validated by using tower-based CO2 flux observations over an 8-year period (2001 to 2008) for one rainfed and two irrigated sites planted to maize as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The results showed the temporal features of the product SW*WDRVI closely related to the temporal GPP variations in terms of both daily variations and seasonal patterns. The simple GPP model was able to predict the daily GPP values and accumulated GPP values of maize with high accuracy.

N2  - Warmer and drier conditions over the past decade in California, in addition to court-mandated restrictions on the Sacramento River Delta water supply, have generally reduced the amount of water resources available to Southern California. These constraints on water supply led water agencies to implement a range of water conservation and watering restrictions programs, mostly targeted at outdoor use. The City of Los Angeles, the largest of 88 cities in the County of Los Angeles and the most populous in the United States, took several measures to attempt to reduce residential water consumption. Three phases of water restrictions were implemented during the 2008-2010 period: voluntary restrictions (FY2008), mandatory restrictions (FY2009), and yet more stringent mandatory restrictions combined with a price increase and a decrease in overall household allocations (FY2010). Our research aims at quantifying the impact of these increasing restrictions on single-family residential water use across the City. Ten years of monthly individual billing data (2000-2010) were obtained from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the municipal utility for the City. Monthly single-family customer water use records at the Public Use Microdata Area level from 2000 to 2007 were used to develop and validate a linear regression model that integrated unemployment and climate information during a period without restrictions. Predictions from the model were then compared to actual consumption to assess the impact of water restrictions during the 2008-2010 period. We also contrasted voluntary water restrictions counseled by LADWP with mandatory water use restrictions. Results show that more stringent mandatory outdoor watering restrictions combined with pricing measures were most effective and resulted in a 23% decrease in City average single-family water use during summer of FY2010. Voluntary restrictions in FY2008 were less effective in reducing water use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N1  - Historical Perspectives on Global Water Challenges
N2  - The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 meant that overnight the newly independent Central Asian Republics (CARs) had to assume responsibility for the management and maintenance of a huge, poorly managed and maintained water distribution and irrigation system. Problems emerged almost immediately with lack of funds virtually halting maintenance programmes and the system rapidly deteriorating. Tension over water has also increased with Kyrgyzstan demanding greater access to the water that is generated on its territory. The situation is likely to worsen as government-backed policies, coupled with predicted population increases, mean that resources will become stressed and demand will far outstretch supply. Given the importance of water to this region it is essential that resources are efficiently managed and used to ensure the economic and social well being of the region into the 21st century. It is evident, however, that the current situation is no longer sustainable and new water management strategies must be developed. This paper provides a brief review of former water management strategies and assesses whether Central Asia can draw on its past to provide insights as to how water should be managed in the future.

N2  - After two decades of implementation, Indonesia's program to reform its irrigation sector can be assessed yielding lessons on water policy reform. This reform coincided with state-wide decentralization, and shifted decision-making from a central ministry to a distributed arrangement in which local governments and Water User Associations assume part of irrigation authority and budget. The policy was formulated with different stakeholders in 1999–2004 based on field pilots and was implemented using an adaptive, sequential approach while developing institutional capacity of local governments and farmers. Relatively coherent longitudinal monitoring data sets are available on field-level practices, economic returns on projects (with and without, and before and after reform), and rice production. Institutional development was monitored by performance indicators. The overall reform effectiveness is assessed by analyzing the appropriateness of the new arrangement, and the processes of the policy design and of its implementation. After two decades well over three quarters of the country is applying the policy albeit with varying quality. At field level water supply and allocation turned more reliable, and conflicts better managed. Rice production increased year over year after 2005 correlating with policy roll-out. Irrigation Departments proved less adequate in partnering with farmers, however. Institutional capacity generated one quarter to two thirds of the economic benefit from investments that combined scheme rehabilitation and institutional capacity development. As institutional capacity develops slowly full roll-out may require up to three decades. The analysis shows that in the context of ‘wicked’ policy implementation, not only normative policy design matters, but equally importantly, the sequencing of the process of implementation allowing adaptation to physical, institutional and political realities; still, to be successful a process must build on a credible realistic ‘model’. This is especially true in developing and emerging economies with weaker institutional capacities and more fragmented governance structures. © 2020 The Author

N2  - Programs targeting conversion to irrigation techniques promoted as water-efficient, such as drip irrigation, are multiplying worldwide with the claimed objective to secure food production while alleviating the pressure on water resources. However, there is a persisting and widespread questioning about the actual impact when implementing the techniques in the real-world context, particularly in smallholder farms. We propose a framework to support an integrated assessment of the impact on farm holding performance resulting from the conversion towards a new irrigation technique. It is implemented for a 4030 ha agricultural district in the Triffa plain of NE Morocco where increasing number of farms are changing surface to drip irrigation. The indicators within the framework are calculated using survey data from a sample of 25 farm holdings collected in 2012 and 2013. The survey data are enriched with institutional data and data estimated from hydrologic modeling. The results indicate that, in the study area, farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors, while most environmental and economic indicators are signaling a neutral or undesirable effect resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation. These results question the relevance of the water use reduction objective underlying the ongoing national plan “Plan Maroc Vert” (PMV) that aims converting up to 50% of irrigated agricultural land in drip irrigation, and call for a stronger appropriation of this water-saving objective by the farm holders. However, limited data availability and quality did not allow to firmly demonstrate the robustness of the findings. This severe data constraint revealed the difficulty to assess the socio-eco and environmental impact of such irrigation plan in the study area, and highlights the need for a data collection, centralization, and sharing effort. Conditioned to a strong reduction in data uncertainty, the framework methodology proposed in this study can serve as a practical reference for other studies seeking for an integrated assessment of irrigation management changes.

N2  - The easy accessibility of groundwater in the alluvial plains of the Kosi river basin has considerably altered the crop calendar and farmers’ irrigation response, especially in the dry years after 2004. The present study attempts to develop a framework for analyzing the spatio-temporal variation in the groundwater recharge/ extraction pattern as well as river and aquifer flux exchange due to increasing anthropogenic activities in the basin. The influence of anthropogenic activities over groundwater recharge/extraction statistics has been discussed in Laveti et al. (2021). The estimated groundwater recharge (Laveti et al., 2021) along with aquifer characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and specific storage), and riverbed conductance were used as inputs to the groundwater flow transient model in the study. The model observed, an increasing groundwater dependency for agricultural activities, results in a continuous increase of flux from the river to the aquifer. Between 1997 and 2010, the river to aquifer flux increased by almost 1% of the average river discharge. This increase in river to aquifer flux exchange was evident, especially during the dry periods after 2004, which coincided with the government’s Million Shallow Tube Well Programme (MSTP) in the basin. The increasing trend of the river to aquifer flux transfer and the decreasing trend of the aquifer to river flux transfer observed in the Kosi basin can have disturbing long-term effects in terms of reduced river flow and river stage. Therefore, the concerned authorities and the stakeholders must take immediate notice of the observations.

N2  - Solar-powered irrigation pumps are a vital tool for both climate change adaptation and mitigation. Since most developing countries cannot fully utilize large-scale global funds for climate finance due to limited institutional capacities, small-scale solar irrigation pumps (SIPs) can provide a climate-resilient technological solution. We study the case of a subsidized SIP program in Nepal to understand who likely benefits from a small-scale climate finance program in a developing country setting. We analyze government data on profiles of farmers applying for SIPs and in-depth interviews with different actors along the SIP service chain. We find that vulnerable farmers (women, ethnic minorities, and poor farmers) were less likely than wealthier and non-minority farmers to have access to climate finance subsidies. Even though the government agency gave preference to women and ethnic minority farmers during beneficiary selection, an unrepresentative pool of applicants resulting from social and institutional barriers that prevented them from applying to the program led to an inequitable distribution of subsidized SIPs. The lack of a clear policy framework for allocating climate finance subsidies was a significant constraint. Lack of periodic updating of SIP prices and poor provision of after-sale services were also responsible for the inequitable distribution of subsidized SIPs. We recommend the involvement of local governments in soliciting applications from a wider pool of farmers, periodic revision of SIP prices to reflect market price, replacement of the current fixed subsidy scheme with a variable subsidy scheme, and mandatory provisions of after-sales services.

N2  - In India, particularly in semi-arid and hard rock regions, the declining water table and the reduction in bore well yield as well as net irrigated area are becoming a common situation to the extent that even implementation of rainwater harvesting programs has been unsuccessful. This is mainly attributed to the adoption of ad hoc management strategies and techniques without considering the geometry and nature of the aquifer together with area-specific parameters, such as soil cover and lithological units. Knowledge of net groundwater recharge (R) and groundwater draft, the two components responsible for changes in groundwater storage (ΔS), is important for assessing the groundwater resources and for the implementation of watershed programs. In the present study, geophysical and hydrogeological investigations were performed to decipher the aquifer geometry and its extent to estimate the groundwater resources and selection of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting.

N2  - As societies confront greater levels of water scarcity, conflict follows. Water transfers are increasing with irrigation water regularly considered in such discussions given it often comprises the bulk of water rights within a particular region, especially in water scarce environments. Here we analyze the impacts of three widely considered and implemented strategies to purchase water from irrigated agriculture—land fallowing, improvements in irrigation efficiency, and direct leasing. Our empirical application involves water transfers from Colorado River water rights holders to the Salton Sea, a critical ecological resource that has been in decline for many decades, with environmental damages estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. We develop a regional hydro-economic model that accounts for essential field-level agro-hydrologic processes related to crop production, irrigation, and salinity to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these three programs. Results indicate that both fallow and direct water lease programs are capable of generating significant environmental water flows with relatively small decreases in agricultural production and no appreciable decrease in grower profits. Because these policies focus on a single input (applied water) rather than overall inflows to the Sea, the direct lease program—which is the most cost-effective approach for generating water conservation— may result in less inflows into the Sea than a land fallowing program.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Leafy green vegetables, including lettuce, are recognized as potential vehicles for foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. Fresh-cut lettuce is potentially at high risk of causing foodborne illnesses, as it is generally consumed without cooking. Quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs) are gaining more attention as an effective tool to assess and control potential risks associated with foodborne pathogens. This study developed a QMRA model for E. coli O157:H7 in fresh-cut lettuce and evaluated the effects of different potential intervention strategies on the reduction of public health risks. The fresh-cut lettuce production and supply chain was modeled from field production, with both irrigation water and soil as initial contamination sources, to consumption at home. The baseline model (with no interventions) predicted a mean probability of 1 illness per 10 million servings and a mean of 2,160 illness cases per year in the United States. All intervention strategies evaluated (chlorine, ultrasound and organic acid, irradiation, bacteriophage, and consumer washing) significantly reduced the estimated mean number of illness cases when compared with the baseline model prediction (from 11.4- to 17.9-fold reduction). Sensitivity analyses indicated that retail and home storage temperature were the most important factors affecting the predicted number of illness cases. The developed QMRA model provided a framework for estimating risk associated with consumption of E. coli O157:H7–contaminated fresh-cut lettuce and can guide the evaluation and development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing such risk.

N2  - Food insecurity is a recurrent problem in northern Ghana. Food grown
during the rainy season is often insufficient to meet household food
needs, with some households experiencing severe food insecurity for up
to five months in a year. Flood recession agriculture (FRA) - an
agricultural practice that relies on residual soil moisture and
nutrients left by receding flood water - is ordinarily practiced by
farmers along the floodplains of the White Volta River in northern Ghana
under low-input low-output conditions. Opportunities abound to promote
highly productive FRA as a means of extending the growing season beyond
the short rainy season (from May to September) into the dry season and
thereby increase household income and food security of smallholder
farmers. This study uses an optimization modelling approach to explore
this potential by analyzing the crop mix and agricultural water
management options that will maximize household income and enhance food
security. Results indicate that growing cowpea, groundnut and melon
under residual-moisture based FRA and high value crops (onion, pepper,
and tomato) under supplementary irrigation FRA maximize household income
and food security. The cash income from the sale of FRA crops was
sufficient to purchase food items that ensure consumption smoothing
during the food-insecure months. The study concludes that the full
potential of FRA will be realized through a careful selection of crop
mixtures and by enhancing access of farmers to improved seeds,
integrated pest management and credit and mainstreaming FRA through
targeted policy interventions and institutional support.

N2  - Ecological assessments often rely on indicators to evaluate environmental conditions. An ecological indicator integrates discrete pieces of information representing condition of resources, magnitude of stresses, exposure of biological components to stress and related impacts and consequences. This paper describes our efforts to develop an ecological indicator based on information routinely collected during irrigation systems operation from projects in Greece. Compromise programming is used for the development of ecological indicators. The indicators can be used for decision making in order to evaluate different irrigation policies for irrigation water management when the water is limited. The results of the alternative policies are compared and conclusions for the application of the methodology are drawn. The study indicated that ecological indicators could be incorporated to select alternatives concerning water delivery. Conclusively, the methodology can be incorporated in ecological assessment and program studies.

N2  - The European water framework directive aims to protect the environmental quality of water and encourage its efficient use. EU member states are required to implement efficient water management systems and appropriate water-pricing methods. This paper examines the economic effects that may arise given the introduction of two different methods for pricing irrigation in the Mediterranean area. The considered pricing methods charge farmers for the costs incurred by water user associations (WUAs) in managing water distribution networks. The first method, based on the metered use of water by farms, is known as the volumetric pricing method. The second is an area-based pricing method, whereby fees are charged per hectare according to the estimated average water use for each crop. The economic effects and the impacts on the water usage of these two schemes are analyzed using a mathematical model that represents the farm sector in a Mediterranean area that relies on a dam for irrigation. The possible effects are analyzed under two scenarios: first, the methods are applied to the observed water-pricing conditions, second, an additional charge is introduced to recover unaccounted costs of the water supply system (e.g., long-term costs related to infrastructure, and the operational and maintenance costs of dams) in line with the water framework directive principle of cost recovery. The results show that the introduction of an additional charge via the volumetric pricing method could stimulate the substitution of water provided via collective networks with groundwater. This could adversely affect the financial situation of the WUA and have negative environmental consequences. This negative outcome does not arise in the case that an additional charge is applied via the area-based pricing method.

N2  - This case study focuses on the approach and impact of JISL’s private extension program for onion production. The extension model features provision of improved seeds, micro-irrigation systems, seed planters, and advice on sustainable agricultural practices according to JAINGAP, as well as purchasing policy and strong financial facilitation. The innovations of the model include varietal development, the invention of the seed planter and harvester, continuous improvement of drip systems, and JAINGAP. In-house R&D has served as the main source of new technologies and approaches, complemented by information gathered from seminars, conferences, and studies. The onion program has generated an enormous impact on the ground; farmers have increased their return on investment significantly and benefited from social welfare provisions associated with this program, such as schooling. Private extension has proven to be useful and effective in this case, with important implications for replication in India and elsewhere.

N2  - More efficient and sustainable use of water is increasingly becoming an urgency in drought prone parts of the world. In particular, in water scarce regions such as the Mediterranean, water supply is expected to become more uncertain because of climate change. Consequently, pro-active policy initiatives are proposed to increase supply reliability. Local context is important when the effectiveness of policies is assessed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate farmers’ acceptance of policy strategies to increase water supply reliability in the Segura, a water scarce river basin in the south-east of Spain. Results from a choice experiment suggest that farmers are willing to pay twice as much as their current irrigation water price to ensure water supply reliability through government supply guaranteed programs. However, they are averse to any institutional changes that might assist the government to achieve increased water supply.

N2  - The transboundary Tigris-Euphrates Basin (TEB) is prone to water-scarcity disputes. Water scarcity is related to aridity, climate extremes, limited supplies, upstream reservoir storage, rising water demand, and population growth. Understanding the water budget and storage changes in the basin in relation to hydrological extremes is fundamental to mitigate the drought and flood impacts and the key to efficient water resources management. This study evaluated the water budget related to drought occurrences in the TEB over four decades (1979–2020) based on GRACE/GRACE-FO, and altimetry satellites data, in situ observations, and hydrological modeling using a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach. Results show that severe droughts occurred at about decadal timescales with increasing recovery times. Severe and exceptional droughts dominated from (1998 to 2000, 2007 to 2009). Mild to moderate droughts occurred in 1983–1984, 1989–1992, 2011–2013, and 2018. The most severe drought occurred in 2007–2009, with the largest decline (−80 km3) in GRACE total water storage (TWS). Depletion in TWS was dominated by depletion in reservoir storage. In contrast, groundwater (GW) depletion accounted for only 25–30% of TWS decline. Storage depletion was amplified by human intervention (e.g., irrigation and GW abstraction) by at least 50% during drought. Marked recovery in TWS occurred in 2019 and 2020 (totaling ~144 km3 by July 2020, representing ~2× total depletion between 2007 and 2018) in response to regional flooding. Applying the BMA approach to the estimates of water cycle fluxes improved the accuracy and similarity of storage change, but not variability relative to GRACE. In summary, prolonged droughts are the norm rather than the exception in the TEB over the past four decades. The frequency and severity of droughts have substantial implications for water scarcity for countries sharing the TEB and underscore riparian countries' needs to expand their water management portfolio to mitigate drought impacts.

N2  - The eWater Source modelling framework has been modified to support the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Dynamic SedNet catchment modelling concept, which is used to simulate fine sediment and particulate nutrient generation, loss, and transport processes across GBR catchments. Catchment scale monitored data sets are used to calibrate and evaluate models. Model performance is assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Modelling predicts that approximately half of generated sediment is delivered to the GBR lagoon; the remainder is deposited on floodplains, trapped in reservoirs or lost through other minor processes (e.g. irrigation extractions). Gullies are the major source of sediment, with comparable contributions from hillslopes and streambanks. Hillslope sources are considered the major source of particulate nutrients across the GBR catchments. We demonstrate that using locally developed, customised models coupled with a complementary monitoring program can produce credible modelled estimates of pollutant loads and provide a platform for testing catchment scale assumptions and scenarios.

N2  - Sugarcane is a major economic crop that is grown mostly where water availability is a dominant limitation to production. However, selection for cane yield under dry conditions is difficult because of variable rainfall and sometimes high experimental error variance. If measurements made under relative non-stress conditions could be used to predict relative yield of genotypes under dry environments it could improve effectiveness of selection, especially in early stage selection trials in breeding programs. In this study, field experiments were conducted to evaluate 31 sugarcane genotypes in rain-fed and irrigated treatments across multiple sites and years in Yunnan province, South China. The aim was to examine relationships between cane yield and several leaf functional traits and determine if measurements made in environments experiencing low water stress could be used to predict relative yield of genotypes in dry environments. The water treatments had a large impact on mean cane yield and all the measured leaf function traits. However, for cane yield genotype×water treatment interactions were relatively small relative to genotype main effects, except when water stress was severe. For the leaf functional traits in most cases, genotype main effects were highly statistically significant while genotype×date and genotype×water interactions were mostly not statistically significant despite contrasting conditions at different dates of measurement. It was found that a combination of high yield and low leaf conductance or high leaf temperature (both of which may be related to reduced rates of water use), all measured under non-stress conditions, was predictive of yield under the limited water treatments, with prediction levels better than either yield or leaf based measurements alone. This is suggestive of a potentially valuable role for this combination of measurements in optimal selection indices in early stages of selection in sugarcane breeding programs. High sampling and error variances and high labour requirements associated with measuring conductance or leaf temperature using traditional methods are a limitation to practical application. However, these may be overcome through emerging technologies enabling related measures through aerial imaging. Development and testing of these approaches is recommended to develop better selection methods in early stage selection trials in breeding programs.

N2  - Climate projection at local scale is one of the crucial challenges that affects the development of water management-related mitigation plans. Moreover, the currently available climate models do not directly simulate some of the hydro-climatic parameters (e.g., effective rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, irrigation requirements), which are of interest in irrigation sector. Modeling crop-water demands under changing climate involves several step-by-step approaches that are tedious and time-consuming for many water users. This study developed a water management tool, hereafter called Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS), for modeling water demand of rice irrigation schemes under climate change impacts. The CSDSS is a user-friendly interactive program consisting of three main modules integrated in MATLAB and a graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE). The model runs with ten Global Climate Models (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). It can generate several hydro-climatic parameters based on a daily water balance model, with input data from GCMs projections, crop, soil and field conditions. The model allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy water management. The generated outputs can be obtained through individual GCMs as well as through multi-models (ensemble) projection and can be converted into excel format for further analysis. The model was applied to evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand and other key hydro-climatic parameters in Tanjung Karang Rice Irrigation Scheme in Malaysia for the period 2010–2099 with reference to the baseline period of 1976–2005. The results show that irrigation water demand will increase during the off-season (January–June) but decrease during the main season (July–December) due to significant contribution from effective rainfall in the latter season. The CSDSS tool can be used for managing water resources under changing climate and would, therefore, be helpful in promoting appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies that can lead to more sustainable water use at farm level. Some future improvements of the tool, due to methodological limitations of the study, will however improve its performance.

N2  - Toxoplasma gondii is a common protozoan parasite, whose environmentally-resistant stage, the oocyst, can contaminate irrigation water and fresh edible produce. Current washing steps in produce processing may not be effective for eliminating T. gondii from at-risk varieties of produce. The objective of this study was to evaluate low-dose irradiation as a means to inactivate T. gondii oocysts on blueberries. Blueberries (10 g) inoculated with T. gondii (5 log oocysts/g) were exposed to an absorbed dose of 0 (control), 0.2, 0.4 or 0.6 kGy gamma radiation at 4°C. After treatment, oocysts were recovered from berries by washing, and excysted sporozoites were enumerated using a plaque assay. Vero cells were maintained as monolayers in a 6-well microplate, exposed to sporozoites recovered from berries, and incubated for 7 days to determine plaque-forming units (PFU). Immediately after treatment, blueberries without inoculated T. gondii were analyzed for compression firmness, surface color, and total anthocyanins. The results from this experiment demonstrate that the viability of T. gondii oocysts was significantly reduced after an irradiation treatment of 0.2 kGy. All treatments produced reductions of 4 log PFU/g beyond the detection limit of 1 log PFU/g. Quality analysis showed that there was no significant change in compression firmness, anthocyanins, or color in berries after the irradiation treatment. Results of this study indicated that low-dose irradiation is a potential intervention measure for controlling T. gondii contamination on blueberries without affecting product quality.

N2  - Bt maize has been grown at the Vaalharts irrigation scheme in South Africa since its first release during 1998. Interest in Bt maize refuge compliance, pest incidence and production practices at Vaalharts were recently stimulated by the first report of field resistance of Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Bt maize. Objectives of this study were to evaluate farmer's perceptions of the regulatory aspects guiding the planting of Bt maize and refugia and how the field situation developed between 1998 and 2008. A survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, was conducted amongst 80 farmers at the irrigation scheme. The questionnaire addressed signing of contracts upon purchasing genetically modified (GM) seed, refuge compliance, refuge design and general farming practices. Farmers were also questioned on the perceived benefits and disadvantages of Bt maize and their perceptions of the pest status of B. fusca. The two greatest advantages associated with Bt maize were indicated to be convenient management (88%) and increased productivity (61.3%) while 42.5% indicated that they perceived Bt-technology to be environmental friendly. Initial levels of refuge compliance were low, and even though farmers were obligated to plant a refuge area for each Bt maize field, only 7.7% of farmers planted refuges during 1998. This number increased to 100% during 2008. Eight percent of farmers, however, indicated that they did not plant a refuge field for each Bt maize field, which was justified on the basis of small farm sizes (25ha). Nearly all farmers (99.8%) allow no spatial separation between the Bt maize field and adjacent refuge area. Farmers preferred to plant the refuge option where 5% of the field area is planted to conventional maize, which is not sprayed with insecticide instead of the 20% refuge area on which insecticide application against the target pest is allowed. In South Africa stewardship programs instituted during the 2008/2009 growing season, involve grower education programs as well as the compulsory signing of contracts between companies and farmers that contractually bind them to comply with refuge requirements accompanied by on-farm inspections. It appears that stem borer resistance to Bt maize in the Vaalharts area resulted from a combination of a late general planting date with consequent increased levels of infestation and variance in time of planting providing a continuous supply of moths.

N2  - A reasonable plant density is the basis for improvement of seed yield by agronomic practice. Previous researches had addressed the influence of plant density on cereal crops and grasses, but little information can be accessed for native plant with potential industrial applications. Artemisia sphaerocephala (Asteraceae) is a widely used pioneer species on moving and semi-stable sand dunes in China. Seed of A. sphaerocephala can provide valuable raw materials to a wide range of industrial purposes. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum between-row and within-row spacing for A. sphaerocephala seed production. Field trials were conducted in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, China, from 2016 to 2018. The experiment was a split plot in randomized complete block design containing three between-row spacing treatments (100, 140, and 180 cm) and four within-row spacing treatments (40, 60, 80, and 100 cm). Meanwhile, correlation and path coefficient analysis were used to determine the contribution of yield components to seed yield. The greatest seed yield were obtained at the combinations of between-row spacing of 140 cm and within-row spacing of 60 and 80 cm, at which combinations the total net profits were also the highest (4304.6 and 4215.9 $ ha−1). Seed germination was not influenced by between-row and within-row spacing treatments. Among yield components, stems per square meter and inflorescences per stem had the greatest contributions on seed yield (0.913 and 0.857 for direct path coefficient, respectively). In conclusion, medium plant densities (between-row spacing: 140 cm, within-row spacing: 60–80 cm) would be optimum for A. sphaerocephala seed production without reducing seed quality. Future breeding program and agronomic practice for A. sphaerocephala should pay more attention to increase stem per square meter and inflorescences per stem. This study will provide useful information to researchers, farmers, pharmaceutical companies, and government program directors to better evaluate the potential industrial utilization of A. sphaerocephala.

N2  - The Middle Eastern countries along with Iran possess an arid to semi-arid climates. For this reason, they encounter many problems in water supply and distribution within different sectors, especially agriculture. Hence, it is necessary to achieve some strategies for optimal, efficient and fair use of water supplies and irrigation grids to manage water allocation and distribution for irrigation in agricultural sector to reduce water wastes. To this end, the present study mainly aims to formulate a model for optimal water distribution for irrigation under uncertain conditions and the impact of water redistribution on the gross profit of farmers. In this study, positive mathematical programming was used and for applying uncertainty in water transfer model, robust optimization method was utilized. A combination of these two methods led to invention of a robust positive mathematical programming (RPMP) model. Tajan Irrigation and Drainage Network in northern Iran was selected as a case study to evaluate the ability of the proposed model. The results showed that with the increase in the probability of deviation (p) of the available water constraint, area under cultivation of all the selected crops decreases, and this can reduce production ultimately declining farmers' gross profits. Also, as the probability level (p) increases, amount of water transfer from upstream to downstream of irrigation and drainage network increases. Thus, cultivation structure should be mitigated for farming crops in order to prevent from reduced profit for farmers. The results of Monte Carlo Simulation indicated that using results of RPMP model were reliable and it might noticeably contribute to changing cultivation pattern.

N2  - Rice paddy fields in the Naboc area, near Monkayo on the island of Mindanao, Philippines, have been irrigated four times a year over the last decade using Naboc River water contaminated with mercury (Hg) by artisanal gold mining in the Diwalwal area. Silt containing up to at least 90 mg Hg/kg (d.w.) has been deposited in rice paddy fields during the 1990s and this has been repeatedly mixed into the rice root zone through ploughing. Hg in the rice paddy field soils averages 24 mg Hg/kg and generally exceeds the UK and Canadian soil quality thresholds for agricultural soils as well as the proposed Dutch Intervention value and the USEPA soil ingestion Soil Screening Level (SSL) for inorganic Hg. Much lower Hg concentrations (0.05–0.99 mg/kg) within the range expected for uncontaminated soils, characterise soils on which corn and bananas are cultivated, largely because these are not irrigated with Hg-contaminated water from the Naboc River. The estimated total weekly MeHg intake for a person living in the Naboc area related to the weekly consumption of 2.1 kg of rice grown on Hg-contaminated soils (15 μg MeHg) in conjunction with 1 kg of fish (220 μg MeHg) and 100 g of mussels (50 μg MeHg) from the Naboc River, would total 285 μg MeHg (equivalent to 4.75 μg/kg bw for a 60 kg adult), which is nearly three times the JECFA PTWI of 1.6 μg/kg bw. This will significantly contribute to the population mercury exposure and might explain why 38% of the local inhabitants were classified as Hg intoxicated during a mercury toxicity assessment (Drasch et al., 2001) [Drasch GS, Böse, O'Reilly S, Beinhoff C, Roider G, Maydl S.

N2  - Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is very important in hydrological cycle research, and is essential in agricultural water management and allocation. The application of the standard model (FAO-56 Penman-Monteith) to estimate ET0 is restricted due to the absence of required meteorological data. Although many machine learning algorithms have been applied in modeling ET0 with fewer meteorological variables, most of the models are trained and tested using data from the same station, their performances outside the training station are not evaluated. This study aims to investigate generalization ability of the random forest (RF) algorithm in modeling ET0 with different input combinations (refer to different circumstances in missing data), and compares this algorithm with the gene-expression programming (GEP) method using the data from 24 weather stations in a karst region of southwest China. The ET0 estimated by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model was used as a reference to evaluate the derived RF-based and GEP-based models, and the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficiency of efficiency (NSCE), root of mean squared error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were used as evaluation criteria. The results revealed that the derived RF-based generalization ET0 models are successfully applied in modeling ET0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables (R2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.637 to 0.987, 0.626 to 0.986, 0.107 to 0.563 mm day−1, and −2.916% to 1.571%, respectively), and seven RF-based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances are proposed. The GEP-based generalization ET0 models are also proposed, and they produced promising results (R2, NSCE, RMSE and PBIAS ranged from 0.639 to 0.944, 0.636 to 0.942, 0.222 to 0.555 mm day−1, and −1.98% to 0.248%, respectively). Although the RF-based ET0 models performed slightly better than the GEP-based models, the GEP approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables, which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills. Therefore, we recommend applying the RF-based models in water balance research, and the GEP-based models in agricultural irrigation practice. Moreover, the models performance decreased with periods due to climate change impact on ET0. At last, both of the two methods have the ability to assess the importance of predictors, the order of the importance of meteorological variables on ET0 in Guangxi is: sunshine duration, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.

N2  - The significant unbalance between water resources and the huge demands in Mediterranean area in Spain (especially for irrigation and tourist infrastructures) entails the necessity of a careful water management. The Spanish Water Resources National Plan (PHN, 2005) foresees to achieve 3Mm³/day of water resource through a significant increase in the desalinated water production, water recycling and modernization of irrigation and supply infrastructures. With respect to desalination, this plan foresees an additional flow rate of 1.55Mm³/day. The plants projected under the PHN (2005) use reverse osmosis technology with conversion rates between 40% and 50%, with the amount of fresh desalinated water and brine effluent being similar. The brine is discharged into the Mediterranean coastal waters, causing a potentially harmful impact on the marine environment, especially on the stenohaline benthic communities: Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa seagrasses. In this paper, the evolution and growth of desalination in Spain is summarised. Brine behaviour, environmental evaluation methodologies, marine monitoring programs and action protocols set up to guarantee the protection of the marine environment are described. A few examples of recently built desalination plants are explained. Based on this experience, some recommendations to improve the discharge system designs are given to minimize impacts.

N2  - To improve the water resource management of the inland river basins of northwestern China, a Decision Support System (DSS) is developed to provide an operative computer platform for decision makers. The DSS is designed according to actual water resource management problems and is seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface implemented in the Visual C# programming language. The DSS comprises an information management system that performs data collection, verification, management, and visualization, and models estimated crop water demand and water allocation for different levels of water use units. The objective of this study is to aid in the decision-making process related to water allocation scheme planning and implementation and to aid real-time responses to changes in water supply, allowing a new water allocation scheme to be developed based on the actual relationship between the supply and demand for water. The system is tested to allocate water to different levels of water use units as a standard decision support tool by means of the actual total available water from rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater. More than 60 water decision makers use the system at more than 40 locations along the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin.

N2  - Water supply and demand policies have associated with different implications for sustainable groundwater management. These policies are adopted aimed to improve the welfare of the water beneficiaries. Accordingly, this study has analyzed the effects of improvement on the irrigation systems efficiency and the internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction in a dynamic market framework in Qazvin plain. For this purpose, firstly water supply and demand functions are estimated, and the effects of applying two different scenarios have been evaluated using the dynamic programming model. The Spatial Lag model has been used to estimate the groundwater extraction function and internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction. According to the results, improvement of irrigation systems has a more effective role in improving aquifer status. Also, applying internalization scenario on the 50-year horizon will reduce the present value of the welfare of the exploiters by 33%, while improving irrigation system will increase their welfare level by 143%. Also, this policy can reduce the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer. Accordingly, it is recommended that supportive policies be developed by the government to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems.

N2  - There is a growing awareness of global forces that threaten human health via the water environment. A better understanding of the dynamic between human health and the water environment would enable prediction of the significant driving forces and effective strategies for coping with or preventing them. This report details the use of the Driving Force–Pressure–State–Exposure–Effect–Action (DPSEEA) framework to explore the linkage between water-related diseases and their significant driving forces. The DPSEEA frameworks indicate that a select group of driving forces, including population growth, agriculture, infrastructure (dams and irrigation), and climate change, is at the root cause of key global disease burdens. Construction of the DPSEEA frameworks also allows for the evaluation of public health interventions. Sanitation was found to be a widely applicable and effective intervention, targeting the driver/pressure linkage of most of the water-related diseases examined. Ultimately, the DPSEEA frameworks offer a platform for constituents in both the health and environmental fields to collaborate and commit to a common goal targeting the same driving forces.

N2  - Spatial factors, such as environmental conditions, distance to natural resources and access to services can influence the impacts of climate change on rural household livelihood activities. But neither the determinants of precarious livelihoods nor their spatial context has been well understood. This paper investigates the drivers of livelihood precariousness using a place-based approach. We identify five community types in rural regions of the Mahanadi Delta, India; exurban, agro-industrial, rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture and resource periphery by clustering three types of community capitals (natural, social and physical). Based on this typology, we characterise the associations between precarious livelihood activities (unemployment or engagement in agricultural labour) with agricultural shocks and household capitals. Results demonstrate that, the type of community influences the impact of agricultural shocks on livelihoods as four of the five community types had increased likelihoods of precarious livelihoods being pursued when agricultural shocks increased. Our research demonstrates that the bundle of locally available community capitals influences households' coping strategies and livelihood opportunities. For example, higher levels of physical capital were associated with a lower likelihood of precarious livelihoods in agro-industrial communities but had no significant impact in the other four. Results also indicate that agricultural shocks drive livelihood precariousness (odds ratios between 1.03 and 1.07) for all but the best-connected communities, while access to household capitals tends to reduce it. Our results suggest that poverty alleviation programmes should include community typologies in their approach to provide place-specific interventions that would strengthen context-specific household capitals, thus reducing livelihood precariousness.

N2  - This paper focuses on water allocation in an irrigation district considering water rights transaction. The relationship between the reservoir authority and the sub-area managers is explored based on a novel Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium model. In this framework, the reservoir authority has higher priority in allocating initial water rights to Sancha town, Danjing and Xinmin villages; after get the decisions from the reservoir authority, the sub-area managers decide water distribution to multi-crops planting areas and water rights transaction with the promise of Nash-Cournot equilibrium, then the reservoir authority can modify his decision by Stackelberg strategic interaction. To obtain the optimal irrigation strategy, fuzzy goal programming and genetic algorithm methods are applied. In this context, a Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium solution can be obtained. The proposed model is applied to Sancha irrigation area, and the results show that more available water can be distributed in Sancha town while guaranteeing the equity among the sub-areas in this irrigation district; more water was utilized for wheat and oilseed rape than paddy and bean, which matched the fact that wheat and oilseed rape grow in quarters with relatively less rainfall inflows. A changeable and uncertain environment, regarding inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient, take potential challenges to agricultural irrigation process. Hence, to cope with the challenges, cope with the future uncertainty and offer more information on the adjustment of agricultural irrigation patterns, scenario technique is applied by changing the three parameters – inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient respectively. Finally, to highlight the superiority of the proposed model, a comparative analysis is conducted in a situation without considering the water market, which verifies the importance and effectiveness of water rights transaction.

N2  - Study region
Kaleya River Catchment in southern Zambia.
Study focus
The ability of a landscape hydrology approach to detect controls on water availability in a fragmented landscape to inform interventions under a changing environment was investigated. Simple and measurable climatic and landscape pattern attributes were analysed using change detection, trend analysis and backward variable elimination with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to identify controls on seasonal river flows and how landscape components could be enhanced to augment natural river flows.
New hydrological insights for the region
Landscape pattern showed increasing fragmentation, expansion of irrigated cropland and reservoirs and loss of forestland. Significant increasing trends (p < 0.05) were observed for reference evapotranspiration (ETo), one-day maximum rainfall, coefficient of variation (CV) of rainfall, maximum dry spell length, and start of rains but not annual rainfall. Increased CV of rainfall, rainfall intensity and ETo were the main climatic stressors on river flows. Increased Percentage of Landscape (PLAND) of irrigated cropland, PLAND of reservoirs, Patch Density (PD) and Largest Patch Index (LPI) of reservoirs were the main landscape pattern stressors. Only the LPI of forestland positively explained seasonal river flows. Water resource interventions in the region must adapt more to changing seasonal rainfall characteristics than to annual rainfall totals. Additionally, regeneration of larger forest patches could improve river flows. The approach can be applied in other regions.

N2  - The toxicity of imidacloprid was evaluated against various developmental stages of the red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier. Based on topical, oral, and contact toxicity bioassays, imidacloprid was very effective in controlling various stages of the RPW. Mortality increased with exposure time and dose. The qualitative chemical analysis, using the TLC technique, detected the imidacloprid residues in leaf base and gomar parts; while the quantitative analysis, using the UV spectroscopy analysis, confirmed and quantified residues in all plant parts. The imidacloprid-formulated compound gave excellent control, in the semi-field and field experiments, when applied with soil-drench-irrigation. The development of treatment strategies for the inclusion of imidacloprid in RPW integrated management programs would be worth considering.

N2  - Groundwater abstraction is among the main anthropogenic causes of wetland desiccation worldwide, and corrective measures must be taken to avoid degradation of this valuable ecosystems. A case study is the Agua Amarga salt marsh (≈180 ha) (SE Spain). Agua Amarga includes a solar saltwork pond network in operation between 1925 and 1975, when it was abandoned, and the ponds were colonized by salt marsh vegetation. In 2008 two desalination plants were operating in the marsh vicinity, which were supplied with groundwater. To mitigate the possible negative impact on the salt marsh ecosystem due to groundwater drawdown, in 2009 a sea water irrigation program was implemented. This paper summarizes the results of a ten-year monitoring program (2010–2020) to evaluate the effects of the irrigation program on groundwater levels and quality, soil salinity and moisture, and vegetation cover. During this period, average groundwater level was 2.5 m below the surface and around 1 m deep near the irrigated ponds. Groundwater salinity was not affected outside the saltmarsh, but inside, where the saltworks caused values to rise above 300 mS/cm, it decreased more than 150 mS/cm in some 20 m deep piezometers. Between 2012 and 2020, vegetation cover increased between ≈10 and ≈25 %, with halophyte species such as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Sarcocornia fruticosa being the most favoured. In areas with prolonged flooding, Ruppia maritima, a plant species that lives submerged in saline water, was found. In the irrigated areas, soil electrical conductivity (1:5 soil:water extracts) decreased from ≈7-14 mS cm-1 to ≈2-6 mS cm-1. We present an example of sustainable actions in a coastal wetland, where the exploitation of water resources in semiarid areas is combined with promoting natural habitats.

N2  - Flows in manifolds are of great importance in quite diverse fields of science and technology, including fuel cells, spargers, solar collectors, microchannels, porous infiltration and irrigation. Theory of flow distribution and pressure drop is vital to predict process performance and efficiency of manifold systems. In this paper, we examined research and development of theoretical models and methodology of solutions in flow in manifolds and highlight remarkable advances in the past fifty years. The main existing models and solution methods were unified further to one theoretical framework, including Bernoulli theory and momentum theory, and discrete and continuum methodologies. The generalised model was applicable to not only designs of continuum manifolds but also those of discrete manifolds with constant or varying factors. The procedure of design calculation is in reality straightforward without requirements of iteration, successive approximation and computer programme. The theoretical model provides easy-to-use design guidance to investigate the interactions among structures, operating conditions and manufacturing tolerance under a wide variety of combination of flow conditions and geometries through three general characteristic parameters (E, M and ζ) and to minimize the impact on manifold operability.

N2  - The issue addressed in this paper is whether implementation of the CAP MTR, (involving decoupled payments reduced by “modulations” and subject to cross-compliance measures) can be effective in improving the environmental impact of arable farming. The focus is on two French cross-compliance measures (compulsory buffer strips along rivers and crop diversity). A farm-level bio-economic model incorporating yield uncertainty is built and adjusted to represent two typical arable farms in the Southwest of France. The model also combines agro-environmental indicators. The results indicate that a simple decoupling of direct payments, without cross-compliance measures, has no impact on allocations between different crops. If cross-compliance measures are imposed, a small reduction in the cultivated area of irrigated crops is observed. The penalty levied (1% of the total subsidy paid) when farmers do not comply with the “buffer strips” requirement is sufficient for both farm-types. Decoupling and modulation result in a fall in the total gross margin of around 3%, principally because of the 5% modulation rate, while the “buffer strips” requirement leads to a further decrease of around 1%. Moreover, this requirement improves the environmental indicators at the farm level.

N2  - Groundwater from the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer is an essential resource for agricultural irrigation in Arkansas, but groundwater from this valuable resource is being withdrawn more rapidly than aquifer recharge in many parts of the state. Rice accounts for a significant portion of groundwater withdrawn from the aquifer. Rice is also a high-cost crop relative to other field crops. This study uses data envelopment analysis and non-radial technical efficiency to evaluate irrigation water efficiency along with the efficiency of other key rice production inputs using data from 142 rice fields enrolled in the University of Arkansas Rice Research Verification Program (RRVP). The study also evaluates the impacts of management practices on input use efficiency using fractional regression. This study differs from most other studies that focus specifically on irrigation water efficiency in that efficiencies of other related rice inputs are also evaluated. We found irrigation water was overused on average by 37.3 % across the 142 fields, with 60 fields (42.3 % of all fields evaluated) over-applying irrigation water by over 50 %. Other rice inputs identified as highly inefficient included herbicides, diesel, and labor, which were overused on average by 46.4 %, 54.6 %, and 58.9 %, respectively, across the 142 fields. Results of the fractional regression analysis revealed management practices significantly improving irrigation water efficiency also significantly improved diesel and labor efficiency as well as overall field efficiency.

N2  - Research for development efforts for increasing rice yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have largely concentrated on genetic improvement and agronomy for more than 50 years. Here we perform the first meta-analysis to quantify genetic gain - yield increase through use of new variety and calculated by yield difference between new variety and variety popularly grown in the target site, and agronomic gain - difference in yield between improved agronomic practices and the control in SSA using 208 paired observations from 40 studies across 12 countries. Among the studies, 41 %, 34 %, and 25 % were from irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland rice, respectively. Seventy percent of the studies reported in this paper were conducted on research stations. In agronomic practices, inorganic fertilizer management practices accounted for 78 % of the studies, of which 48 % were nitrogen (N) management. In each study, we identified four types of varieties: check variety (VC), variety with highest yield in the control (VHC), variety with highest yield under improved agronomic practices (VHT), and variety with largest yield difference between improved agronomic practices and control (VHR). VHT was the same as VHC in 35 % of observations, whereas VHR and VHT were the same in 51 %. These indicate that it is possible to develop varieties adapted to different agronomic practices and high-yielding varieties tend to be responsive to improved agronomic practices. On average, total gain in yield with improved agronomic practices and VHT was 1.6 t/ha. Agronomic practice accounted for 75 % of the total variation in total yield gain with variety and agronomic practice by variety interaction responsible for 19 % and 6 %, respectively. Genetic gains in yield with VHC, VHT, and VHR were 0.7, 0.3, and −0.3 t/ha in control, and 0.4, 0.9, and 0.5 t/ha in improved agronomic practices. Agronomic gain in yield averaged 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, and 1.6 t/ha in VHC, VC, VHT, and VHR, respectively. Agronomic gain in yield of VHT was higher than genetic gain under improved agronomic practices in 54 % of observations. Agronomic gain was highest in irrigated lowland rice, followed by rainfed lowland rice. Higher agronomic gain in yield was also associated with larger difference in N application rate between improved agronomic practices and control. Whereas agronomic practices had larger contribution to total gain in yield than genetic improvement in this study, future assessment of agronomic and genetic gains in yield is warranted. Such assessment should focus more on rainfed rice systems, where agronomic gain was small, take into account genetic improvement rate over time and integrated agronomic practices rather than single intervention like nutrient management practice only, and be conducted in farmers’ fields.

N2  - Because of drought and nutrient stress, the yields of rainfed lowland
rice in Central Java, Indonesia, are generally low and unstable.
Variation in groundwater depth can contribute to experimental
variability in results of yield-increasing interventions. To test this
hypothesis, we used the crop growth simulation model ORYZA2000 to
explore the impacts of groundwater depth on the effect of sowing date,
tillage, fertiliser-N application and supplementary irrigation on the
yield of lowland rice at Jakenan, Central Java, Indonesia. ORYZA2000 was
first parameterized and evaluated using data from eight seasons of field
experiments between 1995 and 2000. The model adequately simulated the
soil water balance, crop growth and grain yield. With shallow to medium
groundwater depth (less than 0.5 m deep), rainfed rice yields are close
to potential yields with timely sowing in the wet season. With
groundwater tables fluctuating mostly between 0.5 and 1.5 m, rainfed
yields are 0.5-1 Mg ha(-1) lower than potential yields with timely
sowing. The decrease in yield with late sowing sets in earlier and
proceeds faster with deeper groundwater depths. Deep tillage and
supplementary irrigation increase yield more with deep groundwater
tables than with shallow groundwater tables, but N fertilisation
increases yield more with shallow than with deep groundwater tables.
Groundwater depth should be taken into account in the selection of
yield-increasing interventions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - This paper introduces a linear programming optimization model for
analyzing interseasonal allocation of irrigation water, in quantities
and qualities and their impact on agricultural production and income.
The SAWAS model is a developed version of the Agricultural Sub-Model
(AGSM). In this research, we stress water scarcity as a problem that
arises when water is not found in proper quantity and quality at the
appropriate place and time. The model is designed to serve as a
decision-making tool for planners of agricultural production on both the
district and the regional level. It generates an optimal mix of
water-demanding activities that maximizes the net agricultural income of
the districts and gives the water demands under various prices. It also
provides the planner with tools to carry out `what-if experiments and to
generate optimal water demand curves. A principal feature of SAWAS is
the use of demand and the benefits from water together with costs and
optimization within the agricultural sector to specify the optimal usage
of different water qualities. Hence the agricultural planner can use
the: outputs of SAWAS in order to bridge the gap between the limited
water resources and the increased agricultural production in an area
that suffers from severe water scarcity. The paper applies the SAWAS
model to the Jordan Valley in Jordan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

N2  - The interactive water-energy relationship is a major restriction on food production in agricultural irrigation systems. Applying water-saving irrigation systems can further intensify the interrelationship between water and electricity and trigger a water-energy joint risk. Currently, there are no approaches capable of effectively assessing the various uncertainties and water-energy joint risks in irrigation districts. In this study, a novel mathematical programming method termed copula-based interval two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (CITSMIP) is proposed. CITSMIP quantifies water-energy joint risks in food production and provides an optimal resource allocation plan and water-saving irrigation application schemes under different joint risk levels. CITSMIP was applied to solve an irrigation resource management problem in northwest China. The results show that under a certain water-energy joint risk, planting sunflowers would be the first choice for water-saving irrigation applications. As water-saving applications have become increasingly common over time, the water-saving volume is expected to increase to [74.65, 84.46] × 107 m3 by 2035. Moreover, under a certain joint risk, compared with the water risk, fluctuations in energy risk would have a greater impact on the total benefit of the system and the total consumption of resources. Compared with single water risk or energy risk management, the joint risk management results would have a lower degree of uncertainty and higher lower-bound benefits. Establishing CITSMIP can provide valuable insights into informing stakeholders to allocate resources and maximize benefits under water-energy joint risk.

N2  - In this paper, we investigate the interactions and feedbacks between the drivers of forest cover and other land uses by building a novel longitudinal dataset and adopting alternative modeling strategies. Our longitudinal dataset integrate land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) information derived by interpreting satellite imagery with social-economic statistics across eight counties in Heilongjiang over a period of 37 years. Employing both instrument variable and system of equations methods, our models capture the inherent endogeneity embedded in the land-use changes and the effects of such factors as demographic change, economic development, and management transition on the forest condition. To validate the robustness of our models, a series of identification, endogeneity, and instrumentation tests are conducted. Our results demonstrate the dominant role of agricultural expansion in forestland loss as well as the importance of considering the substitution between forestland and wetland in analyzing the driving forces of LULCC in general and deforestation in particular. The significant coefficient of the Natural Forest Protection Program implies that it has played a positive role in protecting local forests. The positive coefficient of built-up area in the farmland equation suggests a strong link between farming and residential and commercial construction; likewise, the negative coefficient of irrigation indicates that wetland loss is adversely affected by the change in local cropping pattern. It is hoped that these and other findings will improve our knowledge of the forest dynamics and their socioecological drivers, leading to more effective policy making and implementation and, ultimately, better resource conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N1  - Soil and Water Conservation and Restoration: Innovative Engineering tools and New Approaches
N2  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the application of three different soil additives on existing selected draught resistant plants in 2016 and 2017 and how these can help improve soil conditions and the reduction of desalinated water for landscape irrigation in the UAE. The methodology of this Doctorate in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) action research project, designed, developed and implemented by the first author, uses a mixed method. The case study is a 364 beds hospital located in Abu Dhabi, capital city of the UAE, with a vegetated open space and decorative water features representing more than 50% of the building footprint. The primary source of the medical facility landscape irrigation and water feature is designed to be air conditioning condensate water to avoid usage of any desalinated water in an arid environment. For four months of the year, the irrigation demand will not be met by the condensate water in winter because peak condensate formation occurs in summer. This shortfall availability during the winter months is proposed to be met by soil amendment and by use of other alternative water types. The soil test results show rapid plant growth with one of the soil conditioner solution whereas water savings is inconclusive due to irrigation system hydraulic irregularities and the lack of irrigation standardized rating for building operation. The next steps are to firstly balance the soil pH with a gypsum solution, to secondly reprogram the irrigation system controller with tested and audited hydraulic building parameters and to thirdly include all adequate parameters including ETo and rainfall to estimate the irrigation demand so that water savings can be accurately monitored. This intervention study will help understand the correlation between soil water quality together with irrigation rate and irrigation distribution system’s audit and how these factors impact on the environment, operation and maintenance cost and practices, greenhouse gas emissions, and building systems water and energy consumption. The results may be relevant to local authorities responsible for making and adjusting standards for outdoor irrigation strategy for all types of building.

N2  - Spatial and temporal variations in groundwater chemistry indicate that the use of low TDS lake water for irrigation, on land located just south of the City of Dixon, Solano County, California, is primarily responsible for improving groundwater quality with regards to salts. The stable isotopes of water further support this finding and suggest that TDS concentrations decrease as groundwater evolves to a more highly evaporated state. This seemingly contradictory finding was primarily attributed to infiltration of low TDS Lake Berryessa surface water, which has an isotopic signature indicative of an evaporated source and is used extensively for irrigation in the area, mixing with poorer quality locally recharged shallow groundwater. Geochemical modeling using the program PHREEQC further supports the anthropogenic aquifer freshening hypotheses through computed reductions in the saturation state of carbonate minerals in the vicinity of land irrigated by lake derived water, which is undersaturated with regards to modeled carbonates. Additionally, δ18O and δ2H were found to be useful in estimating climatic variables such as temperature and humidity, illustrating the potential for applying these models in hydrologic investigations within the area. It was however found that USDA NRCS soils data and measured water chemistry were not well correlated and thus the use of soils classifications to assess potential groundwater quality impacts was of limited utility.

N2  - This paper provides results of an application of a holistic systematic approach of water accounting using remote sensing and GIS coupled with groundwater modeling to evaluate water saving options by tracking non-beneficial evaporation in the Liuyuankou Irrigation System (LIS) of China. Groundwater rise is a major issue in the LIS, where groundwater levels have risen alarmingly close to the ground surface (within 1m) near the Yellow River. The lumped water balance analysis showed high fallow evaporation losses and which need to be reduced for improving water productivity. The seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETs) was estimated by applying the SEBAL algorithm for 18 NOAA AVHRR-12 images over the year of 1990–1991 (April 1990–March 1991). This analysis was aided by the unsupervised land use classification applied to three Landsat 5 TM images of the study area. SEBAL results confirmed that a fair amount (116.7MCM) of water can be saved by reducing evaporation from fallow land which will result in improved water productivity at the irrigation system. The water accounting indicator (for the analysis period) shows that the process fraction per unit of depleted water (PFdepleted) is 0.52 for LIS, meaning that 52% of the depleted water is consumed by agricultural crops and 48% is lost through non-process depletion. Finally, the groundwater modeling was applied to simulate three land use and water management interventions to assess their effectiveness for both water savings and impact on the groundwater in LIS. MODFLOW's Zone Budget code calculates the groundwater budget of user-specified subregions, the exchange of flows between subregions and also calculates a volumetric water budget for the entire model at the end of each time step. The simulation results showed that fallow evaporation could be reduced between 14.2% (25.51MCM) and 45.3% (81.36MCM) by interventions such as canal lining and groundwater pumping. The reduction in non-beneficial ETs volumes would mean that more water would be available for other uses and it would allow the introduction of more surface water supplies in the area through improved water management strategies. This will ultimately lead to improved water productivity of the LIS system.

N2  - Biomarkers analysis serves as an early warning system for the presence of pollutants because their responses appear before irreversible damage to the ecosystem takes place. The genotoxic effects of pollutants may occur at cellular pollutant concentrations that are well below levels that would cause gross cytotoxicity, making this a useful tool to detect early effects of toxic environmental agents. Combining the importance of Brazilian wetlands to the conservation of amphibian biodiversity with the potential negative impacts of irrigated rice fields in the surrounding areas, the aim of the present study was to evaluate genotoxic damage in two amphibian species, Pseudis minuta, and Leptodactylus gr latrans, from the southern Brazilian wetlands. Adult specimens from both Anuran species were captured from preserved (Taim Ecological Station=TAIM) and non-preserved (Senandes) wetlands. Nuclear abnormalities were quantified in erythrocytes, and the results were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. There was a higher incidence of micronucleated erythrocytes in P. minuta, and of notched nuclei in L. gr latrans that were collected in TAIM when compared to those that were collected in Senandes, despite the fact that TAIM is a conservation unit. These findings indicate that Anurans are coping with genotoxic substances in their habitats, and underscore the need to implement monitoring programs in TAIM to determine which compounds or mixtures might be causing cell damage and to investigate the effects of such compounds on other anuran species and animal groups.

N2  - Grapevine is a traditionally non-irrigated crop that occupies quite an
extensive agricultural area in dry lands and semi-arid regions.
Recently, irrigation was introduced to increase the low land yield, but
a good compromise between grape quality and yield is of major importance
for the achievement of high-quality products as wine. Therefore,
water-use-efficient irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation programs
need to be developed to improve water-use efficiency, crop productivity
and quality in semi-arid crops.
In the present review, current knowledge on grapevine responses to water
stress is summarised. Based on this knowledge, the usefulness of
different physiological parameters is discussed, and current. knowledge
on their applicability for water stress detection and irrigation
management in grapevines is reviewed. Partial root drying (PRD) and
regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) programs are proposed as the most
promising tools for such purpose. Among RDI programs, several parameters
are proposed as putative indicators of irrigation convenience and
dosage. These are sap flow (measured by sap flow meters), trunk growth
variations (measured by linear transducers of displacement, LTDs),
canopy temperature (assessed by infrared thermometry), reflectance
indices (measured by spectroradiometers or specifically designed
instruments) and chlorophyll fluorescence (measured by either active or
passive fluorometers). Advantages and disadvantages of all these tools
are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Central Greece has a vital role in the financial life of the country, because of its significant agricultural production. The drought, which has prevailed throughout several years over the last decades and amplified by the increase of population and the water demand for irrigation, poses a serious threat. The aim on this article is, to determine the observed characteristics of convective activity in Thessaly plain, in the framework of a potential precipitation enhancement project in the area and to evaluate the performance of the non-hydrostatic Weather Research and Forecasting modelling system with the Advanced Research dynamic solver (WRF-ARW) as a valuable and useful tool for planning and performing such projects. To meet these objectives, the data information from April to September, for the years 2006–2010, are studied. Adopting the manual upper-air synoptic circulation types methodology, the examined cases are classified into distinct synoptic circulation patterns. Analogous radar information from a C-band (5-cm) weather radar system, through the TITAN algorithm, is used. The state-of-the-art WRF-ARW numerical model, with sophisticated microphysical parameterizations, is setup regarding domains and physics configuration, initialization data and justification for the adopted choices. The observed characteristics of convective activity are calculated, for each upper-air synoptic circulation type, during the examined time period. After pursuing the model verification procedures, high-resolution WRF simulations are performed, for selected case studies, under all the upper-air synoptic circulation types. The statistical evaluation of the model performance reveals that the upper-air synoptic circulation type of the cases plays an important role in the performance of the model. Nevertheless, in all the cases, the model performed adequately, giving results that match similar studies. Hence, the performed comparison between these two data sets reveals the usefulness of the WRF-ARW model in a potential rain enhancement program.

N2  - Pesticide contamination of groundwater is of paramount importance because it is the most sensitive and the largest body of freshwater in the European Union. In this paper, an isotopic dilution method based on on-line solid phase extraction–liquid chromatography (electrospray)–tandem mass spectrometry (SPE–LC(ESI)–MS/MS) was used for the analysis of 22 pesticides in groundwater. Results were evaluated from monitoring 112 wells and piezometers coming from 29 different aquifers located in 18 ground water bodies (GWBs), from Catalonia, Spain, for 4years as part of the surveillance and operational monitoring programs conducted by the Catalan Water Agency. The analytical method developed allows the determination of the target pesticides (6 triazines, 4 phenylureas, 4 organophosphorous, 1 anilide, 2 chloroacetanilides, 1 thiocarbamate, and 4 acid herbicides) in groundwater with good sensitivity (limits of detection <5ng/L), accuracy (relative recoveries between 85 and 116%, except for molinate), and repeatability (RSD<23%), and in a fully automated way. The most ubiquitous compounds were simazine, atrazine, desethylatrazine and diuron. Direct relation between frequency of detection of each target compound and Groundwater Ubiquity Score index (GUS index) is observed. Desethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine, metabolites of atrazine and simazine, respectively, presented the highest mean concentrations. Compounds detected in less than 5% of the samples were cyanazine, molinate, fenitrothion and mecoprop. According to the Directive 2006/118/EC, 13 pesticides have individual values above the requested limits (desethylatrazine, atrazine and terbuthylazine lead the list) and 14 samples have total pesticide levels above 500ng/L. The GWB with the highest levels of total pesticides is located in Lleida (NE-Spain), with 9 samples showing total pesticide levels above 500ng/L. Several factors such as regulation of the use of pesticides, type of activities in the area, and irrigation were discussed in relation to the observed levels of pesticides.

N2  - Addressing irrigation water efficiency continues to emerge as one of the potential solutions to minimize irrigation water use, improve water quality, and enhance soil health. Despite the clear importance of financial information in decision‐making regarding adoption of irrigation tools, little information is available regarding the profitability outlook of such adoption. Lack of assessment of costs and returns could lead to producers resisting adoption citing profit reductions. Hence, a cost-assessment using the financial information is necessary to evaluate the tools’ economic outlook. By using long-term projections of input prices, crop yield, and crop prices, this paper develops a financial analysis of irrigation using surge valves by calculating annual cash flows and net present value. The analysis is based on demonstration plot results and anecdotal estimates related to water savings and yield improvements in corn and soybeans in Louisiana and Mississippi. The positive estimates for net present value indicate that an investment in irrigation efficiency improvement is an economically sound choice. These estimates can enhance the adoption of irrigation‐efficiency improvement practices by providing an initial understanding of the overall profitability independent of short-term management decisions.

N2  - Policies on bioeconomy are some of the key emerging ones around the world to support sustainability in terms of using renewable resources. However, these may lead to significant demand for biomass feedstock which relies on limited resources, viz., water, land, and energy. The impact of climate change on water availability makes it more challenging. This paper demonstrates the analysis of the water, energy, and food resource nexus of a bioeconomy-based industrial complex and future climate change impact. The model structure consists of cultivation, crop processing, and urban sectors. Sugarcane is the major crop in the case study area and is the main bioeconomy crop. The results indicate that the average sugarcane yield will be lower than the minimum industrial goal for the 2020s and 2030s decades. Consequently, sugarcane feedstock shortage may often occur. The drought situation tends to be increased, so groundwater resources can be the main reserve source of water. In all improvement scenarios on water supply management, nexus energy used for water acquisition was mainly for groundwater acquisition. Direct energy use in the cultivation process is high and fossil fuels based, while most of the energy used in processing came from biomass waste. This implies that technologies for water acquisition will be more important in the future and should be developed in terms of energy efficiency and the aspect of promoting the usage of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases and fossil fuels use. The impact of climate change will cause significant fluctuations in the annual rainfall characteristics of the study area. An additional irrigation water supply of about 250 mm and expansion to cover more than 90% of the cultivation area should be considered to secure the minimum supply of sugarcane for the local biorefinery complex in the following decades.

N2  - The behavior of atrazine has been studied mainly in laboratory
experiments, seldom directly in the field, and even less in agricultural
plots irrigated with wastewater. In the Mezquital Valley, central
Mexico, maize (Zea mays L.) crops have been irrigated with untreated
municipal wastewater for more than 100 years. The herbicide atrazine has
been applied to maize for weed control for 20 years. The research
objectives of this study were: (i) to monitor the persistence and
migration of atrazine and its main metabolites (hydroxyatrazine (HyA)
and deethylatrazine (DEA)) in a wastewater irrigated maize field along a
cropping cycle; (ii) to assess their sorption behavior in batch
experiments; and (iii) to determine the degradation of atrazine under
field conditions. Soil samples (0-15 and 25-40 cm) were collected before
and after three irrigation events within a 2 ha plot.
Additionally,percolation water was collected below the rooting zone and
down to 5.0 m depth. Atrazine degradation was studied by calculating
dissipation rates considering field data. Atrazine was detected in soil
and percolation water during the first two irrigation events after
application. HyA was detected only in the soil samples from the first
and third irrigation events (similar to 0.08 mg kg(-1)) while DEA was
found only in the percolation water of the second irrigation event (0.03
mg L-1) and also in the groundwater (similar to 0.02 mg L-1) from a deep
piezometer. Batch experiments showed, that the soil has a higher
affinity for atrazine (Kd = 5 L kg(-1)) than for HyA and DEA (Kd = 1.3 L
kg(-1)). The atrazine half-life value was 16 days under field
conditions. The moderate filter capacity of the soil and the relatively
fast degradation rates seem to prevent the transport of atrazine and its
metabolites into the unsaturated zone. Nevertheless it is recommended to
establish a monitoring program with more narrow time intervals during
the first days after atrazine application. We concluded that the large
wastewater volume applied for irrigation explains themobility of these
compounds.

N2  - The random disposal of vegetable residues in north China has become an important obstacle for the sustainable development of vegetable industry. The composting treatment technology has been transformed into organic fertilizer by high temperature fermentation, which has become a widely promoted agricultural clean production technology. However, due to the voluntary nature of farmers' adoption and their reluctance to adopt, this study aimed at assessing the factors that influence their adoption will and evaluate the value of willingness to pay (WTP) for composting technology. Data were collected from 142 respondents through a household survey in Gaocheng District by using structural questionnaire of contingent valuation method (CVM). Some qualitative response models (Probit, Logistic and multiple linear regression models) were applied for examining the main factors influencing the vegetable residue compost adoption and estimating the WTP value. The findings showed that social resource factors play an important role in the respondents' behaviors toward composting technology adoption. The empirical results indeed highlighted that subsidy policy, top dressing time, age, scale, investment of irrigation and net income have significant positive influences on the WTP of compost, while work time and information sources have a negative impact. Government subsidy is a necessary premise for implementing the composting program. The governments should subsidize the remaining 97% of the construction costs to ensure the smooth implementation of composting technology. The findings specifically mentioned that the subsidy object should be the disadvantaged peasant groups with lower household income but more environmentally conscious. This paper is believed to not only assess the technical externality of vegetable residues for the first time but also provide decision reference for policymakers, especially in the background of rapid development of agricultural clean production technology, the accuracy and efficiency of subsidies should be improved.

N2  - Rapid health-risk assessment of chlorinated sewage-effluent irrigation of lawns, fields and crops adjacent to populated areas at the University of Western Sydney was carried out in response to warnings from the supplying authority of deteriorating bacteriological quality of the water. Irrigation with low-quality effluent offered potential for the contamination of a range of foodstuffs and the exposure of staff, students and visitors. The need for early investigation was emphasised by eutrophication presenting as sudden algal bloom in one of the campus dams and an odour suggestive of anaerobic proteolysis on irrigation. No baseline data existed regarding improvement or deterioration in water quality with passage through the dams, or relating to potential for direct or indirect exposure. The assessment design incorporated three methodologies to generate biophysical, environmental and social data. Environmental and social data were used to augment short-term data for biophysical indicators in the estimation of risk. Where required qualitative information was converted to quantitative data using categorical ranking tables, and risk evaluation was carried out using ranked risk and uncertainty values. Results for biophysical indicators showed a steady improvement in water quality with passage through campus dams, emphasising a need to regard the impoundments as part of a treatment chain, rather than as passive storage units. Effluent quality at most irrigation sites marginally exceeded regional action thresholds for relevant crop types, suggesting a need for risk management through revised irrigation practice, system design, distribution management and risk communication. Problems requiring urgent intervention included the concentration of contaminants of bovine faecal origin in one dam as the result of a closed loop within the reticulation. Also of concern was the exposure of certain most susceptible individuals including crèche children who visited pastureland and orchards where irrigated oranges were collected, and potentially immunocompromised or mentally challenged adults in a work-opportunity gardening scheme. Despite its limitations, rapid risk assessment enabled identification and proactive management of major risk factors, promoted risk communication and awareness, and laid the foundation for ongoing risk surveillance.

N2  - In 2013, our team performed a program evaluation of the sustainability and water quality of 338 Elephant Pumps in Malawi. The team tested the water quality, evaluated the pump functionality and investigated the community's satisfaction. The water in most samples (68%) conformed to the Malawi Government drinking water standard for Escherichia coli. Likewise, the nitrate concentrations were within both the Malawi Government and the WHO established standards. The functionality of the Elephant Pumps was 78% (producing water), which is comparable to the functionality rate of hand pumps in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is posited as 64%. Pumps that are working well tend to have the lowest (significantly) E. coli contamination levels. The majority of the households use the water for common household activities; however, water was also used for irrigation and commercial purposes in a limited number of cases. Ninety one percent of the respondents reported that they were very satisfied with the pump design. Although most Elephant Pumps produce water that conforms to the standards by the Malawi Government and with above average functionality, no perfect pump design exists. The performance of Elephant Pumps can still be improved through better training of area mechanics and community pump caretakers, and the availability of improved networks for spare parts.

N1  - Contributions to the International Water Resource Economics Consortium 10th Annual Meeting
N2  - West Africa's rice imports currently satisfy 70% of the soaring local demand, worsening the food vulnerability of an increasingly urbanized population. Despite considerable rice-growing potential, lack of water control systems, access to improved seeds, agrochemicals and appropriate mechanization have resulted in modest production growth rates, unable to alter the region's dependency on imported rice. Governments aim to boost production with import duties and input subsidies. However, questions remain as to whether these policies enable the rice sector to respond to changing consumers preferences for high grade rice and to contribute to national economic growth. We present the results from a Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) on rice production in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Niger and under three water management systems: irrigation (public scheme), supplemented rain-fed (rainfall aided by autonomously-sourced water supplies) and purely rain-fed. Our results show that policy interventions in these West African countries (i.e., input subsidies and import taxes) did not significantly enhance the profitability of rice production to farmers due to the effect of market failures (limited capital access and non-competitive market for rice) and the low quality of local milled rice. The PAM results point strongly to the importance of improving rice quality and yields through more efficient water management and post-harvest handling/processing and targeted breeding to match consumers' preferences.

N2  - CONTEXT: As a direct link between farmers and manufacturers of
technologies, the characteristics and activities of input suppliers can
be expected to play an important role in the generation and diffusion of
innovations in agricultural systems. While the agricultural innovation
systems (AIS) literature recognises the importance of input suppliers,
there are few studies from the Global South assessing the nature and
implications of their activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to
improve the understanding of how input suppliers can influence the
functioning and development of AIS in the Global South. METHODS: We
first adapt the `functions of innovation systems' framework to examine
the role of these private sector actors in an AIS, identifying three
activity categories, through which input suppliers can influence the
AIS: market creation for technological innovations, the creation and
dissemination of knowledge, and influence on technology priorities. We
then apply the framework to a case study of the small-scale irrigation
sector in Kenya. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The case study documents the
emergence of a new cohort of irrigation-equipment suppliers during the
period of strong growth in the market for small-scale irrigation
technologies since 2000, and examines how they affect the small-scale
irrigation agricultural innovation system (SIAIS). We find that Kenyan
irrigation-input suppliers perform important activities and roles in the
SIAIS aside input supply, notably provision of advisory services,
improvement of the supply chain for irrigation technologies,
introduction and adaptations of new types of irrigation equipment, and
facilitation of access to farm credit. Irrigation-input suppliers in
Kenya thus play an important role in the functionality of the SIAIS,
particularly regarding knowledge creation and dissemination.
SIGNIFICANCE: The novelty of the paper lies in its empirical assessment
of input suppliers in the small-scale irrigation sector and its
application of the functions framework. The paper shows that input
suppliers can become effective agents of knowledge diffusion once the
market has reached a sufficient size and documents how they contributed
to knowledge development as they develop, adapt and test specific
irrigation equipment. The paper also emphasises that input suppliers can
form a key link between national AIS and foreign companies, as they
bring in foreign expertise (know-how) to the market along with
agricultural technologies. We therefore suggest that policy
interventions in support of smallholder irrigation should seek leverage
from the growth and capacities of input suppliers as a complement to
public research and extension.

N2  - The impacts of the depletion of the Ogallala aquifer on the economy of the Southern High Plains of Texas were estimated by predicting future cropping patterns over a 30-year time horizon as the saturated thickness of the aquifer declines. Increased adoption of sprinkler irrigation methods, increased cotton acreage, and a shift to dryland production were the main responses found to declining water availability in the region. As the Ogallala aquifer is depleted, the region could experience a downturn in agricultural production with possible negative impacts on the regional economy assuming no other offsetting exogenous shocks to the economy.

N2  - Understanding the interdependency, availability, and accessibility of surface water and groundwater plays a major role in identifying and managing water security. The Ganges Delta in Bangladesh is a classic example of a water insecurity scenario in a transboundary river basin where concerns in quantity, quality, and timing of available water are producing disastrous conditions. This study examines surface water and groundwater uses and demands, seasonal availability, sustainability, and potential water security concerns. Human interventions that can influence seasonal water availability and shifting demands between surface water and groundwater are also examined. Surface water availability was analyzed using streamflow including the effects of upstream water diversions, rainfall, temperature, and evapotranspiration. Groundwater data was collected from 283 locations established by the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Total water storage anomaly data from the GRACE satellite (2002–2016) was analyzed to assess changes in groundwater availability. Both in situ and GRACE data show a significant declining trend in groundwater. Comparisons of groundwater recharge and withdrawal amounts in six different years (1983, 2009–2012, 2015) indicate an unsustainable water withdrawal condition. Irrigation is the largest sector of off-stream water use with total water withdrawal amounting to 31% for surface water and 68% for groundwater. The region’s domestic water use entirely depends on groundwater, which is problematic due to arsenic pollution. This study provides insight into the changes in surface water and groundwater resources and limitations to freshwater availability, thereby encouraging a better management strategy for water resources in the region.

N2  - The contamination of water resource and food chain by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) constitutes a major environmental and human health concern worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of POPs in irrigation water, soil and in Amaranthus viridis (A. viridis) from different gardening sites in Kinshasa to evaluate the potential environmental and human health risks. A survey study for the use of pesticides and fertilizers was carried out with 740 market gardeners. The levels of POPs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) were analyzed in irrigation water and 144 vegetable samples collected from different gardening sites. The assessment of potential human health risk was estimated by calculating daily intake and toxic equivalency to quantify the carcinogenicity. The results show highest PAH levels in A. viridis from all studied sites. The concentrations of the sum of seven PCBs (Σ7PCBS) congeners in analyzed plants ranged between 15.89 and 401.36 ng g−1. The distributions of OCPs in both water and A. viridis were congener specific, chlorpyrifos-ethyl and p,p′-DDE were predominantly detected. Among PBDEs, only BDE47 was quantified with noticeable concentration in A. viridis, while no PBDEs were detected in irrigation water. Higher estimated daily intake values indicate that consuming leafy vegetables might associate with increased human health risks. However, calculated incremental lifetime cancer risk values indicates no potential carcinogenic risk for the local population. The results of this study provide important information on A. viridis contamination by POPs and strongly recommend implementing the appropriate measures to control the use of chemicals used in studied gardening areas. Thus in Kinshasa, urban agriculture control programs for POPs and fertilizers is very important in order to protect the public health through direct and dietary exposure pathways.

N2  - Economic analysis of climate scenarios and alternative water policies is critical for development and implementation of appropriate water policies and programs. Mathematical models have been developed to assess water resources policies due to their ability to explicitly represent the biophysical dynamics of natural systems while integrating these within social and economic constraints. These models have been criticised, however, due to the problems of simplification, overspecialisation, plausibility and lack of empirical validation. This paper introduces a mathematical programming model which uses positive mathematical programming method to calibrate and model agriculture and water use in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. This paper reviews the theoretical and technical details of the model development including the key steps taken in collating and scaling the biophysical and economic data, and to address model parameterisation issues. The paper summarises results of an application of the model for assessing climate change impacts in the form of reduced rainfall and water allocations and increased crop water use for agricultural production. The results show the degree of variability in gross values under different climate scenarios compared to the base case scenario, especially in very dry years. The results also show how on-farm adaptation options and water markets can mitigate these losses.

N2  - Climate change-associated drought stress in plants is one of the major environmental factors that cause a reduction in plant growth, development, and productivity. Therefore, an improvement to obtain superior genotypes that are highly adaptable to arid and semi-arid conditions remains the main objective of the future breeding efforts. In this context, the present study was conducted to determine the genotypic differences among 16 inbred lines and 4 commercial cultivars of pumpkin associated with the parameters such as certain fruit characteristics, seed yield, and seed quality in irrigated and drought conditions. In the growing season of pumpkin, the amount of irrigation water applied was 402.6 mm in 2017 and 425.4 mm in 2018. In all the evaluated parameters, the examined genotypes exhibited a wide range of significant differences between the irrigated and drought conditions in both the years. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit number, seed-thickness and plant height, and 1000-seed weight and seed size. In terms of seed quality, 1000-seed weight was determined to be a prominent parameter. The results of the present study demonstrated that these relationships imply a significant potential for the selection of genotypes with superior performance in both conditions. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA), performed considering the Eigenvalues, indicated that the yield and quality components could be explained strongly by the PCA analysis in irrigated as well as in drought conditions. Finally, the inbred line G9 was observed to be the most superior genotype in terms of yield and fruit number in both irrigation and drought conditions; therefore, this inbred line is envisaged to be evaluated in future breeding studies and to be included in future hybrid programs in order to develop drought-tolerant cultivars.

N2  - Helleh River, a southern vital agricultural ecosystem in Iran, has been suffering from both water shortage and quality degradation in recent decades. To deal with the problems, different stakeholders have been suggesting the central government some compartment development plans including construction of dams and irrigation districts, installation of modern irrigation technologies, and modification of crop patterns and irrigation–leaching strategies. Accordingly, this paper proposes a generic novel hydro-economic methodology for basin-scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme for Helleh River Basin. Mentioned measures in different spatial scales from farm-level to basin-level as well as distinct time horizons of short-term and long-term are holistically evaluated and optimized based on technical, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic aspects. In this regard, a water allocation simulation model, i.e. WEAP software, improved here by some extra modules for salt routing and economic evaluation in Python Programming Environment is coupled with an optimization algorithm, i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization, which results in a new holistic hydro-economic simulation–optimization tool. Results demonstrate the economic efficiency of constructing three new dams, improvement and development of 19930 ha (ha) of irrigation area, irrigation technology, and strategy change, and crop pattern modification. Furthermore, results show that optimizing irrigation–leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of the economic value of water compared to the status quo, while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in the economic value of water due to increase in both costs and leaching-related water usage. We discuss how irrigation technology improvement in salinity-affected basin may lead to a decrease in the economic value of water. Moreover, we advocate for the application of deficit irrigation strategy while respecting salt leaching requirements and cultivation of lower water-consuming crops. Results demonstrate how reservoirs’ operation takes a minor role in the regulation of rivers’ salinity, while we anticipate a significant increase in salt concentration of crops’ root zones due to more efficient water use.

N2  - Lake Chapala is a major source of water for crop irrigation and subsistence fishing for a population of 300,000 people in central Mexico. Economic activities have created increasing pollution and pressure on the whole watershed resources. Previous reports of mercury concentrations detected in fish caught in Lake Chapala have raised concerns about health risks to local families who rely on fish for both their livelihood and traditional diet. Our own data has indicated that 27% of women of childbearing age have elevated hair mercury levels, and multivariable analysis indicated that frequent consumption of carp (i.e., once a week or more) was associated with significantly higher hair mercury concentrations. In this paper we describe a range of environmental health research projects. Our main priorities are to build the necessary capacities to identify sources of water pollution, enhance early detection of environmental hazardous exposures, and deliver feasible health protection measures targeting children and pregnant women. Our projects are led by the Children's Environmental Health Specialty Unit nested in the University of Guadalajara, in collaboration with the Department of Environmental Health of Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Pediatrics of the New York School of Medicine. Our partnership focuses on translation of knowledge, building capacity, advocacy and accountability. Communication will be enhanced among women's advocacy coalitions and the Ministries of Environment and Health. We see this initiative as an important pilot program with potential to be strengthened and replicated regionally and internationally.

N2  - Raw seed sprouts have been implicated in several food poisoning outbreaks in the past 10 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that sprout growers use interventions (such as testing of spent irrigation water) to control the presence of pathogens in the finished product. During the sprouting process, initially low concentrations of pathogen may increase, and contamination may spread within a batch of sprouting seeds. A model of pathogen growth as a function of time and distance from the contamination spot during the sprouting of alfalfa in trays has been developed with Enterobacter aerogenes. The probability of detecting contamination was assessed by logistic regression at various time points and distances by sampling from sprouts or irrigation water. Our results demonstrate that microbial populations and possibility of detection were greatly reduced at distances of ≥20 cm from the point of contamination in a seed batch during tray sprouting; however, the probability of detecting microbial contamination at distances less than 10 cm from the point of inoculation was almost 100% at the end of the sprouting process. Our results also show that sampling irrigation water, especially large volumes of water, is highly effective at detecting contamination: by collecting 100 ml of irrigation water for membrane filtration, the probability of detection was increased by three to four times during the first6hof seed germination. Our findings have quantified the degree to which a small level of contamination will spread throughout a tray of sprouting alfalfa seeds and subsequently be detected by either sprout or irrigation water sampling.

N2  - The economic literature has extensively researched water markets, finding that this instrument can deliver superior resource allocations under growing scarcity. However, these assessments typically ignore the information, bargaining, and enforcement costs that occur in trades, known as transaction costs, which can be particularly relevant in emerging markets such as those for water. This paper presents a multi-agent cellular automata model that couples a positive multi-attribute utility programming (PMAUP) model with an agent-based model (ABM) to elicit the information transaction costs of water trading under alternative market and climate scenarios. A first experiment evaluates an ideal water market with no transaction costs, which is then compared to alternative decentralized spot market setups representing different degrees of information availability that are modeled using the coupled PMAUP-ABM. The difference between the economic surplus under the ideal market and that achieved under alternative market setups with information constraints is used as a proxy value of information transaction costs. Methods are illustrated with an application to the Douro River Basin in central Spain. Results show that information transaction costs can reduce the economic surplus between 0.6% and 45% depending on the scenario.

N2  - This paper presents a micro-level simulation study on possible impacts of farm level adaptation strategies using a spatial dynamic hydro-economic model called Mathematical Programming based Multi Agent System. The model was validated for the Northern semi-arid region of Ghana. The simulation results revealed that climate variability has substantial impacts on the poverty and food security status of farm households. Policy interventions like the provision of agricultural credit and expansion of irrigation access are found to be highly important in reducing the adverse effects of climate variability for the capital constrained and poor rainfed farm households. However, to achieve significant changes in food security, a mix of adaptation strategies in the form of credit and irrigation has to be provided simultaneously. We also found that farm level adaption through shifting planting date as well as adopting early maturing crop varieties can substantially reduce the adverse impacts of climate variability.

N2  - We analyze 20,660 transactions of single family detached houses sold in 2003 and 2004 in the city of Los Angeles, CA, to estimate the value of urban trees, irrigated grass, and non-irrigated grass areas. To deal with spatial autocorrelation and unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we contrast two models: a geographically weighted regression model, and a Cliff–Ord model with spatial lags in the dependent variable, the exogenous variables, and the disturbances as well as submarket fixed effects and an extensive set of covariates. We find that Angelenos like lawns: over 88% of the properties examined would gain value with additional irrigated grass on their parcel, and even more (89%) in their neighborhood. Although more non-irrigated grass/bare soil on parcels typically hurts property values, it often has the opposite effect at the neighborhood level. Moreover, additional parcel trees would decrease the value of almost 40% of the properties examined and they would have only a small positive impact on most of the others. By contrast, additional neighborhood trees would slightly increase the value of over 97% of the properties analyzed. This suggests that while Los Angeles residents may want additional trees, they are unwilling to pay for them. These results have implications for urban tree planting programs that rely primarily on private property owners.

N2  - The impact of climate change and variability on agriculture and food security is severe in countries that heavily depend on rainfed subsistence agriculture. Examine climate change and variability and determinant factors of adaptation to ensure household food security in Basona Worena District, central highland of Ethiopia. Data were collected from the randomly selected 138 sample households, key informants and National Meteorological Agency. Rainfall and temperature trend and variability were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Precipitation Concentration Index. Household food security was determined using Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Food Consumption Score. Moreover, Tobit Model was used to examine climate change and variability adaptation options, while ordered logistic regression was employed to examine the contribution of climate change and variability adaptation to household food security status from the food consumption dimension. In the study site, an increasing minimum and maximum temperatures and decreasing and variable annual and spring season rainfalls were observed. The site has experienced recurrent drought for the last 35 years (1981–2016). Farmers were practicing biophysical soil and water conservation technologies, agro-forestry, small scale irrigation, livelihood diversification, and growing of high yielding and drought resistant crop varieties. The study identified that extension advisory services, access to training, farm size, sex, frequency of flood, and access to credit determine farmers’ climate change and variability adaptation options. HFIAS and FCS analysis shows that food insecurity is high in the study site. Household food security status was influenced by climate variability and limited adaptation responses. The study suggests the implementation of feasible soil and water conservation, and livelihood diversification intervention to ensure household food security.

N2  - Drought is a worldwide problem seriously influencing production of agricultural plants such as coriander, but development of tolerant genotypes is inhibited by a lack of effective selection criteria. The objective of this study was to interpret the relationship between fruit yield and related traits in coriander to evaluate genotype by trait interaction by considering genotype×irrigation interaction. According to this aim, 16 Iranian endemic coriander genotypes were grown in a glasshouse under well watered (WW) and water stressed (WS) conditions. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used, based on genotypic correlation coefficients and genotypic variance estimates obtained from combined analysis of WW and WS conditions and genotype-trait (GT) biplot analysis. Applying both types of analyze to the multiple trait data revealed that SEM and DC+YPr data based GT biplot results are similar. The GT biplot graphically displayed the interrelationships among traits and facilitated visual comparison of genotypes for selection. Predictors in the causal diagram could explain 70.8%, 80.9%, 100% and 41.7% of the total variation in fruit weight per plant (FWPP), fruit number per plant (FNPP), day to end of flowering (DTEOF) and umbel number per plant (UNPP), respectively. Also, the GT biplots explained 81.2% for WW data, 74% for WS data and 79.7% for DC+YPr data. It was found that selection for high SPAD chlorophyll content in the grain filling stage (SCCIGFS), UNPP, FNPP and branch number per plant (BNPP), and low shoot dry weight per plant (SDWPP) and DTEOF should be considered as priorities in breeding programs for coriander aiming for more productive and drought tolerant genotypes. Furthermore, G13 (TN-59-353) can be used as a drought tolerance donor in breeding programs.

N2  - The economic, technical and strategic factors are the three most important factors in examining the cropping patterns in Iran. Iran is geographically located in a part of the planet with specific climate constraints. Drought is one of the constraints that has been a major challenge to agricultural development for many years and has always been the subject of discussions and investigations. On the other hand, constraints such as agricultural soils, economic factors, climate change, agricultural workforce, etc., multiply the production challenges in the country. Despite such constraints, planning a coherent and targeted program for the cultivation of crops and overcome the existing problems is inevitable. The present study introduced a model for optimization of regional cropping pattern decisions, which is one of the subsets of the Multi-Objective Structural Planning (MOSP) approach, and addressed different objectives, such as economic, social and environmental objectives, separately and jointly. However, it is important to address the exchange of crops in different areas in order to achieve the fundamental objectives of determining the optimal cropping pattern. Therefore, in the proposed model of optimal regional cropping pattern, issues such as the transportation of crops and, consequently, virtual water and energy exchanges were also considered. In order to evaluate the proposed model, agricultural arable lands located in the political-geographic divisions of 23 counties of Isfahan province (Iran) were selected for examination. The results showed that in the main groups of grains and forage, a significant reduction was observed in the optimal crop area of the multi-objective model by 26% and 5%, respectively. Increasing the crop area of horticultural products by 10% in the optimal pattern of multi-objective model was another important factor in the analysis of the results. In general, in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental objectives mentioned in this study within the framework of a multi-objective planning, a 16% reduction in the level of the crop area in Isfahan province is inevitable. The results of this measure are reduction in the irrigation water consumption by 17%, increase in the profit by 58% and increase in the production by 11%. Regarding the fact that in the structural planning of cropping pattern, different and sometimes conflicting objectives are considered and the compromise between the objectives is possible in the multi-objective structural planning model, the decision makers are recommended to use this model.

N2  - Increasing scarcity of freshwater resources and growing environmental awareness give rise to the use of reclaimed wastewater as an additional source of water supply. However, the amount of wastewater that can be reclaimed for reuse is subject to many factors, ranging from technical possibility to socio-economic and institutional conditions. Taking Beijing in China as a case study, this paper provides a systematic framework for the analysis of wastewater reuse potential under various driving forces and constraints. A linear programming model was used to analyse different reuse scenarios concerning alternative wastewater charges and reuse prices. The results suggest that the wastewater reuse potential is high at competitive prices. Wastewater treatment plants appear to be more economically efficient over on-site operation facilities in providing treated wastewater for reuse. The main users of the treated wastewater are agricultural irrigation and urban recreation sectors. The framework established in this study and the results of the Beijing case study help to better understand the complex systems and evaluate the effect of key factors influencing the potential of wastewater reuse. The study also provides a useful basis for the evaluation of wastewater reuse potential for other cities in China as well as cities in developing countries with similar conditions.

N2  - The Rio Cobre Irrigation Scheme, Jamaica, supplies water to 5000ha by allocating a fixed unit discharge at each offtake. A computer water management model, IRMOS, was used to assess the scheme’s performance during a typical operating year and to identify water management constraints to performance. An optimal water allocation policy was used as a benchmark against which the actual performance was evaluated. The comparison identified constraints in the scheme which can be improved by a variety of measures which include modifying the water allocation policy, operational procedures and physical components of the scheme. Despite the fact that operating under an optimal water allocation policy requires more data, better monitoring and a higher calibre of staff, the analysis shows that the potential benefits far outweigh the additional costs. The process shows how the use of modelling to identify performance shortfalls followed by management (rather than infrastructural) interventions can be a valid way forward to improving scheme performance.

N2  - Groundwater chemistry and quality studies have been carried out in the Brajrajnagar coal mining area to find its suitability for human consumption, domestic use, agriculture use as well as industrial purposes. A total of fifty-four water samples were collected in Polyethelene containers from several surface and groundwater sources during the summer month of May, 2015. Physical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS) and temperature were measured in situ. Major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42− NO3−, Cl−, F− and HCO3−) and trace elements (B, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Ba and Pb) were analysed in the laboratory. Hydrogeochemical facies present in the groundwater have been identified. On the basis of water chemistry, water quality index (WQI), heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) were determined to ascertain the overall quality of the water for drinking purposes. Suitability of the water for the agricultural purposes was also determined using sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), US salinity diagram, Wilcox's diagram, Kelly's ratio (KR) and permeability index (PI). The overall groundwater quality studies show that 15% samples are poor in quality for drinking purposes and 43% water samples require special treatment prior to irrigation. The present work will help the local government bodies and mining planners to understand the spatial variation of the quality of groundwater of the Brajrajnagar coal mining area. It will also help to know about the degradation in the water quality and its possible sources and to adopt appropriate monitoring programmes and strategies for protection of the water resources of the region.

N2  - The uncertainty of the hydrological environment and unbalanced water resource allocation result in a high risk of irrigation water shortages in regional agriculture, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agricultural systems. In this paper, we propose a risk regulation based modeling approach for the optimal allocation of agricultural water resources in a complex stochastic environment. The approach includes a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) model, two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) model, two-dimensional joint distribution probability (JP) model, fractal criteria, and a multiple forms of chance-constrained programming (CCP) model. The model can weigh the contradiction between the intended target and associated penalties attributed to unknown hydrological events, measure the risk between system benefits and expected losses in agricultural water allocation at different confidence levels, and address the randomness in the objective function and constraints (including the left end term, right end term, and left and right end terms). To verify the applicability of the method, it is applied to the Jinxi Irrigation District in China to optimize the allocation and risk regulation of limited water resources under the variable runoff conditions of the Songhua River and crop water demands in the irrigation area. By adjusting parameters such as risk preference and probability of violation, the risk of water shortages in the irrigation area can be regulated, and the multidimensional impacts of different water allocation schemes on agricultural economic benefits, social benefits, ecology and environment can be determined. The case study reveals that the CTSP-CCJP method is sensitive, applicable to complex and uncertain environments and important for the efficient use of agricultural water resources and risk reduction.

N2  - The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C (0.65–1.06°C) over the period of 1880–2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020–39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5–9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented. Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices. CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the “triple win” of overall CRA. The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks. The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world. Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers’ participatory approach. To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card–based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations. Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential. These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country.

N2  - Successful scale-up of any development project requires a deep understanding of the real-world economics of the intervention, and compelling evidence that such an investment would be worthwhile. This cost-benefit estimate is typically assessed in two ways: (a) by comparing the coefficient of impact along some margin measured in an impact evaluation (βˆ) to the unit implementation cost of the project, and/or (b) by conducting adoption studies, where autonomous adoption is assumed to indicate that the adopter has deemed the investment worthwhile (i.e., financially sustainable). However, these two techniques can be particularly difficult for development engineering projects that are large at the unit scale (or are group-based) and for projects that may have impacts on many margins or outcomes at once. Here we present the framework for, and analysis from, a field monitoring campaign in the interim evaluation period for community-scale solar-powered irrigation systems (Solar Market Gardens, or SMGs) in northeast Benin, West Africa. We used this interim monitoring to directly construct a CBA, and to document the pathways of impact actually at play for a project hypothesized ex-ante to have potential economic, food security, and gender impacts. We monitored all garden activity a the individual and group level for most of the dry season, including total production, sales, home consumption, input use, marketing, and labor (a key factor often overlooked when considering the cost of agricultural development projects). By combining production and sales data with cost information, we show that the most productive agricultural groups using the system only in the dry season would be profitable in a full cost-recovery model with no economies of scale, but that lower performing groups would not; we also show that many plausible scale-up models and financing mechanisms would be profitable. We then show how this type of monitoring can complement impact evaluation by elucidating different pathways of impact that could be used to understand heterogeneity in outcomes among beneficiaries. We document variance both within and between groups across numerous potential pathways of impact for the SMG; the heterogeneity in intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) across these indicators highlights the importance of understanding the causal chain(s), especially for cross-sectoral development engineering projects like the SMG. We conclude by discussing how this monitoring effort fits into the larger evaluation of the SMG, and how such data have been used to both adaptively refine the project, improving the likelihood for successful scale-up. © 2018 The Authors

N2  - Groundwater pollution caused by leaching of NO3-N from agricultural systems has caused public concern for decades. To preserve the groundwater and reduce economic losses for the farmers, a rapid and accurate estimation of NO3-N moving below the root zone is crucial. In this study, the value of the computer program NLEAP (Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package) to simulate nitrate leaching was evaluated using data from an experiment conducted with 12 lysimeters (1.25m i.d. and 2m deep) in 1996 and 1997. Three tomato (H2274 variety) seedlings were planted in each lysimeter and nitrogen rates of 0, 80, 160, and 240kg Nha−1, as ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate, were applied to the lysimeters under a fixed irrigation program. Effluent was collected from the outlets of the lysimeters and analyzed for NO3. The model adequately simulated nitrogen leaching for each year (R2=0.93 and P<0.03 for 1996, and R2=0.87 and P<0.06 for 1997). The high coefficients of determination, between observed and simulated values, revealed that the model can be successfully used to estimate the amount of the NO3 leaching under the experimental conditions. The results also showed that the NO3 available for leaching (NAL) values were important background information for determining an optimum N rate for groundwater quality and maximum gain, and NO3 available for leaching (NAL), amount of NO3 leached (NL), movement risk index (MRI), and annual leaching risk potential (ALRP) parameters should be considered together to estimate the nitrogen pollution risk.

N2  - The spatial variability of soil parameters such as salinity and sodicity
is very effective in determining the suitable areal cropping pattern and
appropriate management of agricultural lands. To conduct this study, a
grid sampling at 100 m was carried out in an agricultural area of 30 ha
located in Tajarak of Hamedan, western Iran. After physicochemical
analyses of soil samples, soil properties which had significant
correlations with the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) were
identified using the statistical analysis. The ESP was significantly
positively correlated with the clay content, pH, electrical conductivity
(EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR),
while it showed a significant negative correlation with the silt
content. The spatial variability of ESP and its related parameters
investigated by the geostatistical analysis showed that pH, EC, CEC,
SAR, and ESP were strongly spatially dependent, while the clay and silt
contents had a moderate spatial dependency. The distribution maps
indicated that most soils in the study area did not have a sodicity
problem, while ESP of soils in some parts was more than 15%. The
long-term impact of the application of saline-sodic and non-saline-sodic
irrigation waters on some chemical properties of a saline sodic soil
under 20 years of the continuous cultivation of wheat and alternate
cultivation of wheat and sugar beet was simulated using the geochemical
PHREEQC program. The results showed that the chemical quality of the
soil was significantly improved after 20 years of irrigation with
non-saline-sodic water. On the other hand, the problem of the soil
salinity was accelerated after 20 years of irrigation with saline-sodic
water, while ESP remained unchanged. Due to the high water requirement
of sugar beet, the effect of its cultivation was not significant in
reducing soil sodicity despite the removal of Na+ from the soil by this
crop. Therefore, it is recommended that the cropping pattern should be
changed by planting crops with low water requirements or rainfed crops
if sodic irrigation water is applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

N2  - Given persistent gender inequalities that influence how the benefits of technologies are distributed, the expansion of small-scale irrigation technologies requires the consideration of important gender dynamics and impacts. Women's lack of agency and access to resources relative to men, and other social constraints, often limit their ability to adopt and benefit from agricultural technologies. At the same time, expanding access to agricultural technology to women may provide a pathway for empowerment. This paper explores the potential for small-scale irrigation technologies to increase women's empowerment by evaluating the impacts of an intervention that distributed motor pumps to small groups of farmers in Northern Ghana. The paper draws on two rounds of survey data that included the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, before and after the motor pump intervention was implemented. To control for possible selection bias at the baseline, the difference-in-difference method is used to estimate the impact of the program on indicators of women's empowerment. Spillover effects are estimated by comparing outcomes of farmers in treatment villages that did not receive the pumps with farmers in control villages, where no motor pumps were distributed. The results show no significant impact of the program on measures of women's empowerment. However, there are potential negative impacts, including among households that did not benefit from the intervention. The results highlight the need to pair interventions that distribute agricultural technologies with complementary investments in infrastructure that increase access to water for irrigation, as well as other activities and approaches that ensure women can reap the benefits.

N2  - Water availability in outback Australia is defined by the occurrence of large rainfall events, and changes often from a situation of scarcity to temporary abundance. Informal institutions are often able to translate such dynamics into sustainable water-use rules. Policy interventions are mainly focused on changing access rules to avoid over-use or inefficiencies. Such formal institutional changes can lead to unexpected unsustainable outcomes; outcomes that are often captured in the ‘story’ behind informal arrangements. This paper analyses one case study on water access in outback Australia and translates field work results into an agent-based model. The agent-based model is calibrated based on data from experiments conducted with actual farmers from the case study region. In order to project unintended outcomes of institutional changes, interventions in water access is explored in an applied context. The core focus of the modelling exercise is the treatment of newcomers on a newly created trading scheme for water access rights. Simulation results show that total water extraction is significantly lower if the burden of water restrictions is limited to newcomers while the regional economic performance is not statistically different from a case in which the burden is carried by all irrigators. Interview data documents that currently extraction levels are regulated by informal processes as community members communicate observations on river health to irrigators who adjust accordingly, which indicates perceived personal responsibility. Overall, the environmental and economic performance of a water trading scheme that will replace this informal self-regulating system depends on how water restrictions are implemented and how valid the overall cap of 20% outtake is, which is not widely accepted throughout the community.

N2  - Cotton production substantially contributes to the GDP of Uzbekistan. It
is produced under a state procurement policy, according to which farmers
have to allocate half of their land for cotton, fulfill cotton output
levels and sell the entire harvest of cotton to the state. Land is state
owned and a land consolidation process is in place, where land allocated
to a farm can be reduced if cotton production targets are not met.
However, low production levels may not only arise due to bad management
practices but also due to production risks, e.g., due to climatic
variability or limited access to inputs such as irrigation water. In
this study, we aim to assess policies that can improve cotton production
levels and farm profits under land consolidation and agricultural risks.
We use a recursive programming model, which considers risk-averse
farmers and their farm size adjustments, together with irrigation
water-crop yield response functions on different land productivity
classes. We consider production, market and institutional risks and find
that such risks affect resource allocation, production levels and thus
also farm size developments. The farm land consolidation improves
overall cotton output, yet, it reduces farm incomes as the state cotton
procurement price is low. Under conditions of the state cotton
procurement and land consolidation, increasing the cotton price can
improve cotton production and farm profits and reduce farm size changes,
but farm size changes still occur among farmers. Having secure land
tenure together with land use flexibility and higher cotton prices
allows farmers to improve incomes, reduce income disparity, diversify
land uses, but results in lower cotton output than under the state
cotton procurement policy.

N2  - Integrated scientific assessments of semi-arid agroecosystems with
mathematical models are challenging because of computational
constraints. These constraints arise from exponentially increasing
decision options due to dynamic interactions between the biophysical
states of rangeland vegetation and farsighted decisions taken by
pastoral stakeholders. This study applies a methodology that integrates
these interactions in a computationally feasible manner. We equip a
dynamic land use decision model with a detailed representation of
biophysical processes by using a Markov chain meta-model of EPIC
(Environmental Policy impact Calculator). Using separate Markov chains
for different weather scenarios, we investigate the economic and
ecological impacts of droughts on rangeland management in southern
Morocco. The drought simulations (2 years with 33% less precipitation)
show a decrease in profits from pastoralism by up to 57%. Pastoral land
use of the rangeland in our model increases surface runoff by 20%,
doubles infiltration, and thus influences irrigation agriculture. The
economic and ecological impacts of drought in our simulation go
substantially beyond its meteorological time horizon. (C) 2011 Elsevier

N2  - Cap-and-trade policy is generally considered an effective instrument in groundwater markets since it can facilitate environmental protection and sustainable groundwater use. While this policy is implemented in several aquifers all over the world, there is a limited understanding of its social impacts, like how compliance and noncompliance behaviors may emerge. This study presents an agent-based groundwater model to evaluate the effects of monitoring and enforcement levels on farmers' social behaviors, namely boldness and vengefulness. The social, economic, and hydrologic impacts of implementing the cap-and-trade policy in the Rafsanjan Plain, located in Iran, are assessed. To this end, the groundwater market model is evaluated under different monitoring and enforcement scenarios. Results show that the efficacy of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater markets substantially depends on the monitoring level and enforcement power. The appropriate monitoring and enforcement settings can lead to the emergence of a social norm that is enough to discourage violation and can bring about a functioning market in which the farmers can be better off economically, and the annual drawdown can become less severe. Furthermore, water buyback programs can increase market competition, compliance level, and farmers' profits. This study specifically demonstrates that as a result of the implementation of the cap-and-trade policy, social norms emerge that affect the whole system, from farmer agents to the efficacy of the policy. While this study concentrated on the application of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater management, the results can provide a foundation for specifying frameworks of the cap-and-trade policy for managing other limited resources or greenhouse gasses emission.

N2  - Most of the hydro-economic models used for assessing the environmental
impact of agricultural policies are deterministic and can only reflect
uncertainties through analyses of scenarios. In this article, we propose
a methodology to assess uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulations.
Taking three different global change scenarios, we vary economic
parameters liable to influence the future of agriculture within each
scenario. The simulations are based on farming models developed for two
French regions (Midi-Pyrenees and Alsace), using linear programming
(LP). These are used to simulate the impacts of a ``business as
usual{''}, ``liberal{''} and ``interventionist{''} scenario, on water
abstraction for irrigation (Neste basin) and on nitrate leaching into
groundwater (Alsace). The simulations all predict a drop in farm income
in both regions, with a stronger effect in the liberal scenario. Water
consumed in the Neste basin increases a little (+0.3 to +3.7% in the
interventionist scenario). A slight decrease of agricultural nitrate
leaching is observed in Alsace, with nearly no difference between the
averages for the three scenarios. Considering all Monte Carlo
simulations the nitrate leaching should decrease between -28% and
-43%, so uncertainty is not very important from the water planning and
management point of view. However, the uncertainty on incomes is
greater. A comparison between the Monte Carlo results and those from the
deterministic approach demonstrates the value of taking uncertainties
into account in foresight modelling exercises: and suggest that Monte
Carlo associated to LP is a partial response to classical criticism
addressed towards basic LP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Groundwater quality in the Ganga-Gomti fluvial plain is influenced by geogenic and various anthropogenic factors like human interventions, urbanization, mineral dissolution, and ion-exchangeability. This study provides in-depth information about the groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation use in Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh state, India. The results based on pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, SO42−, Cl− and F− suggest that most of the groundwater is appropriate for drinking usage. In contrast, elevated NO3− concentration was found in about 6% of the samples, which is much higher than the no-relaxation limit of 45 mg L−1 set by the Bureau of Indian Standards. Based on the water quality index (WQI), the study reveals that 34% of the samples have good water quality for drinking usage, while 55% of the samples are of the fair type and about 11% of the samples indicate poor quality water. The Gibbs plot suggests that rock weathering or rock-water interaction processes are dominant in the investigated area controlling groundwater chemistry, particularly silicate weathering mostly due to the forward ion-exchange. The Piper plot indicates that Ca2+-HCO3- is the major hydrochemical facies, along with the dominant presence of Na+-HCO3- resulting in mixed Ca2+-Na+-HCO3- type water. Groundwater quality for irrigation purposes was evaluated using suitable indices and ratios such as sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, sodium soluble percentage, magnesium hazard ratio, Kelly's ratio, percent sodium, permeability index and potential salinity. The overall values of these indices and ratios show that most of the groundwater is suitable for irrigation use, except for the MHR which indicates that 87% of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation usage.

N2  - Accurate assessment of hydrological processes in a catchment including the estimation of virgin or natural flow regime of the rivers is critical to maintaining healthy river ecosystems, particularly in the developing nations that currently face the challenges of limited quantity and poor quality of available water. In this work, we aim to estimate the natural river flow and its variability due to land use and land cover (LULC) alterations over a period of ∼43 years (1970–2013–14) in the Ramganga River Basin (RRB), a sub-basin of the most fertile and densely populated basin in the world i.e., the Ganga River Basin. Hydrological modeling of the RRB was performed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and its performance was evaluated by performing statistical analysis (e.g. coefficient of determination and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies). The simulated flows exhibited good agreement with the observed flows at the three flow monitoring stations in the RRB - Katghar, Chaubari, and Dabri. Upon achieving a good model performance, the natural flows for the 2013-14 LULC scenario were estimated by removing all existing flow interventions (e.g. dams and barrages) and irrigation usage. Average annual natural flows were observed to be higher by at least ∼40% than the average annual existing flows (i.e., flows estimated with current managed conditions) for the three stations. Historical LULC information for the basin was obtained from the object-based image classification of CORONA satellite images (1970). The annual average natural flows for the 1970 scenario were observed to be lower (3–12%) than the 2013-14 scenario which could be attributed to a significant increase in urban settlements and a reduction in the area coverage by barren land and shrubs and bushes. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the natural flow regime and its variability due to anthropogenic activities and long-term LULC alterations in the RRB which may inform future strategies for sustainable water resources management in the basin.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture in the European Union (EU) is currently adapting to new conditions including the principle of the full recovery of water service costs, the reduction of water availability and the increasing variability in the prices of agricultural products. This has fostered an increasing number of economic analyses to investigate farmers’ behaviour by means of mathematical programming techniques including Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models. However PMP models generally consider only activities observed in the reference period even if, under new policies and market conditions, farmers can adopt irrigation techniques they have not used previously. In particular, under increasing water costs or decreasing water availability, farmers can introduce Deficit Irrigation (DI) techniques that might not have been profitable earlier. We propose an extension of the PMP approach to include DI techniques not observed in the reference period. These alternative techniques are identified by means of a crop growth model developed by the FAO. We apply our methodology to a Mediterranean area using three sets of simulations involving: increases in water costs, reductions in water availability, and changes in the prices of the products obtained from irrigated crops. Lacking observations of alternative irrigation techniques, our approach captures potential technology adjustments and assesses the impact of changes in water policy and market conditions in a better way. Simulation results show that increasing water costs do not motivate adoption of DI techniques. Rather, farmers are induced to save water by switching from full irrigation to deficit irrigation when water availability is reduced or the prices of irrigated crops are increased.

N2  - This paper examines the effectiveness of reforming water rights regimes in the agricultural sector by replacing allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with the implementation of a priority rule that establishes security-differentiated water rights. The main objective is to assess whether this change improves the economic efficiency of water allocation at the irrigation district level, particularly during cyclical scarcity events. To this end, a Positive Mathematical Programming model is built to simulate the performance of the proposed reform in an irrigation district in southern Spain. The results show that the efficiency gains brought about by this change are very small, which casts doubt on its ability to improve water-use efficiency in the agricultural sector at the local level (i.e., irrigation district) under current local climate and water availability conditions. In any case, further research is needed to assess the suitability of this change in allocations rules at basin scale with greater farm heterogeneity, especially given the likelihood of more frequent, more intense droughts due to climate change.

N2  - Effects of future expansion/intensification of irrigated agriculture on groundwater and surface water levels and availability in a semi-arid watershed were evaluated using an integrated hydrologic model (MIKE SHE/MIKE 11) in conjunction with biophysical measurements. Improved water use efficiency, water storage, and energy policy options were evaluated for their ability to sustain the future (2035) increased groundwater withdrawals. Three future withdrawal scenarios (low= 20, medium= 30, high= 50wells/100km2/year) based on the historical rate of growth of irrigation wells were formulated. While well drying from falling groundwater levels was limited to drought and consecutive below average rainfall years, under the current (2015) withdrawals, significant increases in frequency and duration (17–97days/year) of well drying along with 13–26% (19–37mm) reductions in surface flows were predicted under the future withdrawals. Higher (27–108%) energy demands of existing irrigation pumps due to declining groundwater levels and reduced hydroelectric generation due to decreased surface flows would create a vicious water-food-energy nexus in the future. Crop failure, one of the main causes of farmers’ emotional distress and death in the region, is predicted to exacerbate under the future withdrawal scenarios. Shift to negative net recharge (−63mm) and early and prolonged drying of wells under the high scenario will reduce the groundwater availability and negatively affect crop production in more than 60% and 90% of cropped areas in the Rabi (November–February) and summer (March–May) seasons, respectively during a drought year. Individual and combined demand (drip irrigation and reduced farm electricity subsidy) and supply (water storage) management options improved groundwater levels and reduced well drying by 55–97days/year compared to business-as-usual management under the high scenario. The combined management (50% drip conversion, 50% reduction in subsidy, and enhanced water storage) mitigated well drying even during drought and consecutive below average rainfall years under the high scenario. A conservative economic evaluation for management options under the high scenario showed increases in crop production and per farmer annual profits by $987–$1397 during a drought year (average household income=$1520/year). A scale-up of results showed that diverting 50% state power subsidy ($6billion for 3–6 years) can almost entirely fund the conversion to drip irrigation ($4.2billion) and water storage structures ($2.9billion) and help meet the water supply demand of a 50% increase in irrigated area under the high scenario. Converting flood to drip irrigation in 50% of irrigated area under the high scenario can reduce the electric energy consumption (7 ×106Mwh/year) and carbon footprint (6000Mt/year) of groundwater irrigation by 24% in the state. Management options considered can potentially create a sustainable water-food-energy nexus in the larger semi-arid hard rock region. Reducing the power subsidy will require a strong political will since it has been used as a tool to win the elections in India. Considering future agricultural intensification, timely interventions are needed to ensure the livelihood and well-being of millions of small- and medium-scale farmers that rely on low storage, hard rock aquifers in the semi-arid regions of the world.

N2  - We used a coupled land-atmospheric simulation framework to quantify the feedback impacts of water resources in a changing climate. The simulations dynamically downscaled data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, Climate Forecast System (CFS) Version 2 and the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), to investigate irrigation effects on temperatures and surface fluxes under current and future scenarios in Southern Idaho. This study implements irrigation schemes within the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) 3.4 at a 4-km resolution to diagnose irrigation-induced changes to surface energy fluxes and boundary layer properties. Our results suggest that induced cooling via evaporation causes a decrease of 0.8°C to the air temperature over April − October, a decrease of up to 90m of the planetary boundary layer depth and an increase of 2.0°C in the dew point over the irrigated areas. On average, the growing season start date trends 0.46days/year earlier and the growing season termination date trends 0.60days/year later. A decrease in precipitation with time is also seen at all elevation ranges from the year 2040–2070, with the lowest elevation levels seeing a bigger decrease than the higher levels. Thus, irrigation-induced increases in growing degree days and modifications to surface fluxes are shown in the basin and it is critical to consider when planning both crop and water management.

N2  - We present an evidence-based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small-scale irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources. We demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site: Dangila woreda in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. This site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the South of Lake Tana and also exists more extensively across Ethiopia. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in SSA. In comparison with other global regions, the groundwater resources of SSA are among the least understood; borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking. Assessments of groundwater resources do exist, but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale, and they focus on deeper aquifers. There is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments. The case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with developing small-scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater. A multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community-based monitoring, field investigation and existing published data. Water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l/s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop. Hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0.2 to 6.4 m/d in the dry season and from 2.8 to 22.3 m/day in the wet season. Specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0.09 is as would be expected. Records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period April 2014 to April 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season. An assessment of the hydrology of the Kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area. The catchment receives about 1600 mm/year of rainfall, of which about 350 mm/year enters the groundwater as recharge, discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm/year. The lowest value of baseflow is 82% of the mean baseflow, which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year. We conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in SSA appear exaggerated. Our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable, and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. It appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the ‘triggering’ of development. Interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers.

N2  - Afghanistan has an arid to semi-arid climate where irrigated agriculture largely depends on scarce irrigation water supplies from snowmelt from the high raised mountains. Under growing water scarcity, farmers not only need to use the available water more wisely but have to develop alternative options for coping water scarcity. Deficit irrigation schedule can be one of the options to mitigate the adverse impacts of water scarcity on crop production. In the current study, FAO’s crop water productivity model (AquaCrop) was calibrated and validated with field data in Kabul River Basin (KRB) for wheat crop to simulate four different water scarcity scenarios (S-A: business-as-usual scenario, S-B: refilling the soil profile to field capacity upon 50 % water depletion, S-C: refilling the soil profile upon 100 % depletion and S-D: refilling the soil profile upon 130 % depletion occurrence) for resultant yield, water productivity (WP) and biomass production. Two wheat fields, namely A and B were monitored intensively for soil moisture content, meteorological situation, irrigation application and post-harvest data. Results show that the measured WP was 1.4 kg m−3 ETa and 1.5 kg m−3 ETa whereas, the actual (measured) water use efficiency (WUE) was 0.58 kg m−3 and 0.66 kg m−3 for Field A and Field B, respectively. The WP of the scenarios S-A, S-B, S-C and S-D was 2.0-2.1 kg m−3 ETa (for plot B and A), 2.5 kg m−3 ETa, 2.74 kg m−3 ETa and 2.8 kg m−3 ETa respectively. Similarly, yield under these scenarios was 6.4 ton ha−1, 8.7 ton ha−1, 7.4 ton ha−1and 6.7 ton ha−1 respectively while the above ground biomass was 21.3 ton ha−1, 21.8 ton ha−1, 19 ton ha−1 and 18.3 ton ha−1 respectively. As a consequence, WP could increase by 92.8 %, 78 % and 95 % in S-B, S-C and S-D, respectively with reference to the measured WP. The optimized scenarios developed in this study can provide guidelines for policy makers and farming communities to mitigate the adverse impact of water scarcity through such innovative interventions.

N2  - Water shortage and soil salinization are the key limiting factors in agricultural production of arid and semi-arid regions. Located in western Inner Mongolia of China, the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) is one of the top three largest irrigation districts in China. Irrigation water overuse and high level of soil salinity have curbed the agricultural productivity, adversely affected farmers’ revenues, and threatened long-term sustainability of irrigated farming in the HID. Nevertheless, opportunities still exist to improve the situation. Irrigation water allocation, salt accumulation and leaching, crop productivity and farming decisions are intrinsically connected and thus require taking a holistic approach to investigate into the interactions among all those factors and devise appropriate technological, management and policy interventions. Towards this goal, we develop an integrated hydro-agro-economic optimization model to reconcile agricultural net revenue, irrigation practices, and environmental sustainability in the HID. Positive Mathematical Programming is used for model calibration to ensure the model can replicate the base year observations of crop acreage, making the model suitable for evaluating alternative scenarios. Scenario analyses are conducted to analyze the effects of water supply reduction, reducing winter irrigation, water-saving irrigation, and crop commodity price change on optimal agricultural water management practices. Results show that water supply reduction without complementary measures increases land fallow, exacerbates soil salinization, and reduces net benefits. Winter irrigation can conserve soil moisture and increase the net salt leaching in the root zone, and a reduction in winter irrigation will incur a benefit loss to the HID. Water-saving irrigation can stabilize planting areas under water shortage but exacerbate soil salinization. Price increase of a cash crop, if it has a large area share, tends to “crowd out” grain crops growing in the same season. These results provide a holistic perspective and useful insights for water management and policy in the HID.

N2  - Groundwater contamination due to pesticide applications on agricultural lands is of great environmental concern. The mathematical models help to understand the mechanism of pesticide leaching in soils towards groundwater. We developed a user-friendly model called ArcPRZM-3 by integrating widely used Pesticide Root Zone Model version 3 (PRZM-3) using Visual Basic and Geographic Information System (GIS) based Avenue programming. ArcPRZM-3 could be used to simulate pesticide leaching towards groundwater with user-friendly input interfaces coupled with databases of crops, soils and pesticides. The outputs from ArcPRZM-3 could be visualized in user-friendly formats of tables, charts and maps. In this study we evaluated ArcPRZM-3 model by simulating bentazon leaching in soil towards groundwater. ArcPRZM-3 was applied to 37 sites in Woodruff County, Arkansas, USA to observe the daily average dissolved bentazon concentration for soybean, sorghum and rice at a depth of 1.8 m for a period of two years. Nineteen ranks of bentazon leaching potential were obtained using ArcPRZM-3 for all sites having different soil and crop combinations. ArcPRZM-3 simulation results for bentazon were compatible with the field monitored data in term of relative ranking and trend, although some uncertainties exist. This study indicated that macropore flow mechanism would be important in analyzing the effect of irrigation on groundwater contamination due to pesticides. Overall, ArcPRZM-3 could be used to simulate pesticide leaching towards groundwater more efficiently and effectively as compared to PRZM-3.

N2  - Stream and riparian zone networks embedded in agricultural landscapes provide a potential intervention point to ameliorate the negative effects of agricultural runoff by reducing transport of nitrate (NO3−) and suspended sediments (SS) downstream. However, our ability to support and promote NO3− and SS attenuation is limited by our understanding of vegetative and hydrogeomorphic controls in realistic management contexts. In addition, agricultural landscapes are heterogenous on multiple management scales, from farm field to regional water management scales, and the effect of these heterogeneities and how they interact across scales to affect vegetative and hydrogeomorphic controls is poorly explored in many settings. This is especially true in irrigated agricultural settings, where stream and riparian networks are entwined with and sensitive to water management systems. To fill these gaps, we related the vegetative and hydrogeomorphic features of 67 waterway reaches across two water management districts in the California Central Valley to reach-scale NO3− and turbidity attenuation and district-scale water quality patterns. We found that in-stream NO3− attenuation was rare, but, when it did occur, it was promoted by shallow and wide riparian banks, low flows, and high channel-edge denitrification potential. Nitrate concentrations were consistently higher in upstream reaches compared to water district outlets, suggesting that while exports from the district were low, agricultural runoff may impair within-district water resources. Turbidity attenuation was highly variable and unrelated to vegetative or hydrogeomorphic features, suggesting that onfield controls are crucial to managing suspended sediments. We conclude that waterway networks have the potential to mitigate the effects of agricultural NO3− runoff in this setting, but that more effective monitoring and adoption of NO3− attenuating features is needed. Using our findings, we make specific management and monitoring recommendations at both reach and water district scales.

N2  - In the first paper of this series, the Loma de Quinto Irrigation District (LQD) was characterised, and water use was assessed. In this work, the analysis of the LQD is completed with field irrigation evaluations, solid-set sprinkler irrigation simulations and irrigation scheduling for optimal crop yield. The results of the irrigation evaluations indicated that the average Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CU) for solid-sets, centre-pivots and linear-moves was 68.0, 75.5, and 80.0%, respectively. In solid-sets CU was severely reduced by wind speed. However, in centre-pivots and linear-moves CU was higher in evaluations with wind speeds between 2 and 6ms−1 than under calm conditions. The evaluation data set was used to validate a ballistic solid-set sprinkler irrigation simulation model. The performance variables used for model validation were CU and the potential application efficiency of the low quarter (PAElq). Both variables were adequately predicted in the range of the observed values. The model was used to extend the evaluation results to all the solid-set plots in the LQD. CU maps were produced for different wind speeds and operating pressures. These maps can be used to identify plots with low irrigation performance. The effect of irrigation scheduling on crop yield and net benefit was analysed using the CropWat simulation model. Simulations of the 1997 irrigation practices performed on a limited number of plots detected a 12% decrease in crop yield due to deficit irrigation and/or large irrigation intervals. The introduction of an optimal irrigation schedule (avoiding yield reductions) would imply increasing the alfalfa seasonal irrigation depth by 101mm, and applying light, frequent irrigation events. Due to labour scarcity in the LQD, the implementation of the optimal schedule would require a high degree of irrigation automation, which is currently unavailable. Taking into consideration the value of the additional yield and the costs of the extra irrigation water depth and the automation devices, the resulting net benefit would be 50ha−1. The purpose of this analysis of the LQD is to contribute to the diagnostic analysis phase of an incipient Management Improvement Program at the LQD. In order to complete this phase, an interdisciplinary committee will perform a study not just on irrigation but on a wide scope of irrigated agriculture in the LQD.

N2  - Previous studies support the hypothesis that large numbers of infaunal burrow-irrigating organisms in the western basin of Lake Erie may increase significantly the sediment oxygen demand, thus enhancing the rate of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. We conducted laboratory experiments to quantify burrow oxygen dynamics and increased oxygen demand resulting from burrow irrigation using two different year classes of Hexagenia spp. nymphs from western Lake Erie during summer, 2006. Using oxygen microelectrodes and hot film anemometry, we simultaneously determined oxygen concentrations and burrow water flow velocities. Burrow oxygen depletion rates ranged from 21.7 mg/nymph/mo for 15 mm nymphs at 23 °C to 240.7 mg/nymph/mo for 23 mm nymphs at 13 °C. Sealed microcosm experiments demonstrated that mayflies increase the rate of oxygen depletion by 2–5 times that of controls, depending on size of nymph and water temperature, with colder waters having greater impact. At natural population densities, nymph pumping activity increased total sediment oxygen demand 0.3–2.5 times compared to sediments with no mayflies and accounted for 22–71% of the total sediment oxygen demand. Extrapolating laboratory results to the natural system suggest that Hexagenia spp. populations may exert a significant control on oxygen depletion during intermittent stratification. This finding may help explain some of the fluctuations in Hexagenia spp. population densities in western Lake Erie and suggests that mayflies, by causing their own population collapse irrespective of other environmental conditions, may need longer term averages when used as a bio-indicator of the success of pollution-abatement programs in western Lake Erie and possibly throughout the Great Lakes.

N1  - Smallholder Systems Innovations for Integrated Watershed Management in Sub-Saharan Africa
N2  - Although spate irrigation systems are risk-prone, they can be an important component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, spate irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate irrigation systems pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream–downstream interactions between users within the system, and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and intake structures. This paper describes a spate irrigation system in Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic and sociological) of spate irrigation proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997) to assess the Makanya spate irrigation system. The Makanya spate irrigation system has an organisational structure that is similar to the canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively deals with the institutional demands of managing water in spate irrigation systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional spate irrigation practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots. Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect the existing locally developed water management arrangements.

N2  - Many water tables are currently overexploited throughout the world. This situation raises the question of their management. Integrated management of such systems, established in both supply and demand areas, calls for thorough knowledge of the functioning of both the water table and its users, so models are usually required. This study is based on the case of the Kairouan water table, located in Tunisia, which has been continuously and globally decreasing for more than 20 years, due to overexploitation by private irrigators. The field study led to the hypothesis that the dynamics of the system is heavily influenced by local interaction between the resource and its users, and by direct, non-economic interaction between the farmers. The literature shows that several kinds of model have already been used to represent interaction between a water table and its users but none of them are able to take this kind of social behaviour into account. The simulator of a water table and user interaction (SINUSE) based upon multi-agent systems enabled us to overcome these limitations. This model proved to be very useful for representing a complex and distributed system such as the Kairouan water table. It enabled us to explore the interaction between the physical and socio-economic components of the system and to conclude that local and non-economic behaviour do have a major impact on the global dynamics of the system and must therefore be taken into account. The management interventions simulated with the SINUSE model have raised interesting questions, leading to the conclusion that this model could provide a useful tool for negotiating the integrated management of the water table system. Though this model is rather specific, the approach developed could be transferred to other water table systems, to improve the knowledge of their functioning and examine the possible impacts of different management tools.

N2  - Water from wastewater-polluted streams and dug-outs is the most commonly used water source for irrigation in urban farming in Ghana, but helminth parasite eggs in the water represent health risks when used for crop production. Conventional water treatment is expensive, requires advanced technology and often breaks down in less developed countries so low cost interventions are needed. Field and laboratory based trials were carried out in order to investigate the effect of the natural coagulant Moringa oleifera (MO) seed extracts in reducing helminh eggs and turbidity in irrigation water, turbid water, wastewater and tap water. In medium to high turbid water MO extracts were effective in reducing the number of helminth eggs by 94–99.5% to 1–2 eggs per litre and the turbidity to 7–11 NTU which is an 85–96% reduction. MO is readily available in many tropical countries and can be used by farmers to treat high turbid water for irrigation, however, additional improvements of water quality, e.g. by sand filtration, is suggested to meet the guideline value of ≤1 helminth egg per litre and a turbidity of ≤2 NTU as recommended by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for water intended for irrigation. A positive correlation was established between reduction in turbidity and helminth eggs in irrigation water, turbid water and wastewater treated with MO. This indicates that helminth eggs attach to suspended particles and/or flocs facilitated by MO in the water, and that turbidity and helminth eggs are reduced with the settling flocs. However, more experiments with water samples containing naturally occurring helminth eggs are needed to establish whether turbidity can be used as a proxy for helminth eggs.

N2  - Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a common practice in the dry environments and aims at improving and stabilizing rainfed crops by adding small amounts of water to rainfed crops during times when rainfall fails to provide sufficient moisture for normal plant growth. Results from long-term research in experimental stations and farmer fields showed substantial increases in rainfed crop yields and water use efficiency in response to SI. Nevertheless, SI comes at a cost. The date of sowing winter wheat in a rainfed Mediterranean-type environment depends upon the onset of rainfall. The optimal date for achieving highest yield under rainfed conditions is around mid-November. However, farmers tend to sow wheat later than this date because of the delay and/or unreliability of initial rains. With SI, early sowing and crop establishment can be ensured. However, early sowing of all the fields’ results in higher water demand during a very short period in spring because all the fields will be at the peak use rate. Spreading out dates of sowing allows peak water demand to occur over a longer period, thus reducing the discharge and the size of irrigation system needed, and hence improves the economics of this practice. In this paper, the impact of adopting a multi-sowing date strategy on farm water demand and crop production is considered. A simplified optimization model solved by linear programming is presented. Four-years’ data (1992–1996) from field experimental research conducted on bread wheat in northern Syria have been used in the analysis. We showed that a multi-sowing date strategy has reduced the peak farm water demand rate by more than 20%, thus potentially reducing irrigation system capacity and/or size. Alternatively, the water demand rate of a larger area can be met with the same water supply. However, optimal sowing dates that minimize farm water demand rate do not always maximize total farm production. The outcome depends on crop water requirements and yield for each sowing date. Furthermore, this selection is greatly influenced by the level of water scarcity. The approach used can help in reducing the cost of irrigation and improving the efficiency of water use in SI.

N2  - Agriculture in the Punjab province of eastern Pakistan benefits from one
of the largest canal irrigation systems in the world. The typical mixed
holding is a small, 5 ha mixed farm with three-quarters of its land used
for cash crops, such as rice, wheat and sugarcane, and the remainder
growing forages such as lucerne and berseem for dairy animals. Both cows
and buffaloes are used for milk production, with the latter the more
productive. Despite irrigation, productivity is constrained by a slow
uptake of new technology such as fertilisers and new plant varieties,
and poor livestock management, which leads to extended calving
intervals, and a lack of available capital. This study used LP models,
constructed with original local data on milk and crop production
activities, to investigate the effect on profitability of alleviating
the main constraints. The results demonstrate the powerful effect of
using better, well managed dairy livestock, of increasing the uptake of
simple technological improvements and of widening access to credit. They
also show the synergy between these elements, for example the importance
of finance as part of any intervention strategy. The results should
enable agricultural development policy makers to rank the changes and
devise better targeted programmes to deliver the changes on farm. (C)

N2  - Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority issue since
available fresh water resources are limited. Water production functions
(WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield,
are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of
yield reduction due to deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i)
designing and evaluating site-specific WPFs (using k nearest neighbors
(k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural networks), (ii)
simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control
VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the
best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning
strategies using integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing
soil-based and WPF-based zones for sector control VRI systems. A
two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013-2014) was implemented to
study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different soil
types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with
root mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha(-1) and 0.194 Mg ha(-1) in
2013 and 2014, respectively. The result indicated that variable rate
irrigation with limited sector control capability could enhance cotton
lint yield under supplemental irrigation when field-level spatial soil
heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in climate and
rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response to
irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short
season environment. We believe site specific WPFs are useful empirical
tools for on-farm irrigation research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

N1  - Invited contributions from the International Symposium Ecohydrology for water ecosystems and society in Ethiopia Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 18-20 November 2009
N2  - Fishery and aquaculture play an enormous role in reducing poverty and alleviating food insecurity at household level. The first fish stocking program in Ethiopia was reported as early as 1925. Indigenous Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zilli, Clarias gariepinus and non-native Cyprinus carpio, Carassius carassius, Carassius auratus, Ctenopharyngodon idella and Salmo trutta fish species were used for stocking. Even though most of the fishery enhancement programs are low-cost operations, they often seem to be very efficient actions. Fish harvested in the reservoirs Fincha and Amerti in Oromia region, lakes Haik and Ardibo in Amhara region and Hashengie in Tigray region, enhanced by stocking, contribute up to 15% of the annual fish production of the country. Thus fisheries programs challenging the growing protein-rich food demand should be considered as a necessary and valuable aspect of management strategy in all waters, independently from its major operational goal like hydropower or irrigation.

N2  - Periploca angustifolia (Labill.) is a multipurpose xerophytic shrub widely distributed in arid zones. It is used in rehabilitation programs; its exploitation and utilization require the understanding of its behavior under stress conditions such as drought. To evaluate drought response and at what level it becomes irreversible, a new analysis of physiological and biochemical performances of this threatened shrub was conducted to assess possible mechanisms of drought tolerance and how these relate to its ecological success. Eleven-month-old plants, grown under semi-controlled conditions, were subjected to a well-watered control treatment or progressive drought by withholding water for 7, 14 and 21d with subsequent recovery for 7-d. After 7days of drought, followed by rewatering period, no significant effect on all studied parameters was recorded for P. angustifolia. However, from 14 until 21days of withholding irrigation, drought becomes irreversible causing plant damages, may be rewatering has no effect to reduce these damages. A water deficit of 21days RWC (33%), chlorophyll a content (0.083mg·g−1 DW), transpiration 14.7%, as well as water and osmotic potential (−3.40 and −3.78MPa) decreased significantly compared with control. While, proline content (0.25μmol·g−1 FW), soluble sugars (80.52mmol·g−1 DW) and vitamins C, E (1.9mM·g−1 FW) increased significantly that could indicate ability of osmotic adjustment in this species. Also the increases in RWC, water and osmotic potentials values after rewatering period indicate the good recovery of this plant. Based on these experiments, responses of P. angustifolia to water stress were typical of those of xerophytic plants.

N2  - In this paper we provide an overview of recent trends in the availability and quality of land and water resources in rural China, and examine the common presumption that rural resources are rapidly degrading in China. Data based on consistent definitions and measurement methods that have recently become available are used to that end. In addition, we analyse the impact of new policy initiatives to introduce market-based instruments and new institutions to address land degradation and water scarcity problems.We find that the decline in cultivated area has accelerated in the beginning of the new century. Ecological recovery programs, not urbanization and industrialization, are the major factors causing this decline. Ecological recovery programs are also a major force behind the increase in forest land area and the reduction of water erosion. Modest successes can be observed in the protection of wetlands and (until the mid-1980s) for the average quality of cultivated land. On the other hand, degradation of natural grassland and wind erosion have become much more severe in recent decades.In northern China, particularly in the 3-H (Hai and Luan, Huai and Huang) river basins, the availability of water has tightened. Groundwater tables have fallen considerably in the Hai river basin, because farmers increasingly rely on groundwater for irrigation. Evidence on other parts of northern China is mixed. Pollution of surface water is getting worse since the beginning of the 1990s in two major lakes in southern China and until recently in the rivers in northern China. Water quality problems in the larger rivers in southern China are less severe and getting less. These problems are to a large extent caused by agriculture-based non-point source pollution, especially in the major lakes and reservoirs.The sloping land conversion program, water pricing, and the establishment of water user associations and payments for environmental service projects are used as cases to examine the introduction of market-based instruments and new institutions. We argue that less government interference in the implementation of these instruments and institutions is likely to enhance ecological as well the economic benefits. Moreover, supportive measures to improve the functioning of land and labor markets are usually needed to ensure the sustainability of the impact of interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Despite major recent advances in socio-hydrology and hydroeconomics research, interdisciplinary methods and models for water policy assessment remain largely concealed to the academic arena. Most river basin authorities still base decision-making on inputs from hydrologic Decision Support Systems (DSS), and have limited information on the economic costs that water policies may impose on the economy. This paper presents a time-variant hierarchical framework that connects a hydrologic module and an economic module by means of two-way feedback protocols. The hydrologic module is designed to fit the AQUATOOL DSS, the hydrologic model used by Spanish river basin authorities to inform decision-making at a basin scale; while the economic module is populated with a Positive Multi-Attribute Mathematical Programming (PMAMP) model that represents the behavior and adaptive responses of irrigators. The proposed hierarchical framework is used to assess the economic repercussions of strengthening irrigation quotas so to achieve minimum environmental flows in the Douro River Basin (Spain) under climate change. Results show that reductions in agricultural water allocations to meet environmental flow requirements create nonlinear incremental profit and employment losses in irrigated agriculture that are on average low to moderate (between −4% and −12.9 % for profit, and between −4.6 % and −12 % for employment, depending on the scenario). During extreme droughts, the abrupt reductions in water availability and agricultural allocations can test farming systems past the breaking point and lead to catastrophic profit and employment losses (>80 %).

N2  - Most water conservation policies will target agriculture, the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal (i.e. least productive) uses of the resource. Adaptation to irrigation rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra-regional (macro) scale. As the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices, the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators’ decisions. This paper proposes an iterative coupling between a decentralized, non-parametric Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming representation of irrigators and a regionally-calibrated Computable General Equilibrium model to assess interlinkages (i.e. two-way feedbacks) between the micro- and macro-economy. Results from an application to irrigation water charges in the Murcia Region in Spain show that the coupled micro–macro model yields lower abatement costs as compared to the stand-alone micro model.

N2  - Accurate prediction of Escherichia coli contamination in surface waters is challenging due to considerable uncertainty in the physical, chemical and biological variables that control E. coli occurrence and sources in surface waters. This study proposes a novel approach by integrating hydro-climatic variables as well as animal density and grazing pattern in the feature selection modeling phase to increase E. coli prediction accuracy for two cascading dams at the US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC), Nebraska. Predictive models were developed using regression techniques and an artificial neural network (ANN). Two adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) structures including subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering were also used to develop models for predicting E. coli. The performances of the predictive models were evaluated and compared using root mean squared log error (RMSLE). Cross-validation and model performance results indicated that although the majority of models predicted E. coli accurately, ANFIS models resulted in fewer errors compared to the other models. The ANFIS models have the potential to be used to predict E. coli concentration for intervention plans and monitoring programs for cascading dams, and to implement effective best management practices for grazing and irrigation during the growing season.

N2  - Arracacha root is an upland crop, quite tolerant to water scarcity conditions, nevertheless, in cases of abnormal climate variability patterns the risk of drought and thus crop productivity loss gets higher. This study aimed to develop an adequate understanding of arracacha crop water management for irrigation purpose. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficient (Kc) were determined based on water balance evaluation on a daily basis in volumetric lysimeter-scale experiments during the crop growing season. Meteorological data base of monthly temperature and precipitation, in Cajamarca (Tolima region, Colombia), from 1980 to 2011 were analyzed. Arracacha soil characterization was carried out in the region. Furthermore, crop water requirement and Net Irrigation Requirement were determined, using Cropwat model, for different hydrological years: Average, El Niño and La Niña. Results showed that total water consumption for arracacha root was 820 mm along the whole growing season. The development stage was the largest stage, nevertheless, the highest water consumption was registered at the Mid-stage which was 39.4 % of the total water consumption. Seasonal crop coefficients were 0.57, 0.72, 0.95 and 0.90 at Initial (Init), Development (Dev), Mid and Late stage, respectively. Furthermore, high yield reductions are expected in the Mid-stage if limited water is supplied. The proposed modeling framework could be recommended for arracacha farmers to select the most suitable scenario for better agricultural water resources management.

N2  - Land Degradation (LD) is a complex phenomenon resulting in a progressive reduction in the capacity of providing ecosystem services (ES). Landscape transformations promoting an unsustainable use of land often reveal latent processes of LD. An evaluation carried out in respect to the different ecosystem services is nowadays regarded as the most appropriate approach for assessing the effects of LD. The aim of this study is to develop an evaluation framework for identifying the linkages between land changes, LD processes and ES and suggesting Sustainable Land Management (SLM) options suited to reverse (or mitigate) LD impact. A SWOT analysis was carried out with the aim to identify internal and external factors that are favorable (or unfavorable) to achieve the proposed SLM actions. The study areas are the Fortore valley and the Valpadana, in Italy. The main trajectory identified for the Fortore valley is related to land abandonment due to population aging and the progressive emigration started in the 1950s. The most relevant LD processes are soil erosion and geomorphological instability, affecting regulating services such as natural hazard and erosion control. SLM options should consider interventions to contrast geomorphological instability, the promotion of climate smart agriculture and of typical products, and an efficient water resources management. The main trajectories identified for Valpadana are related to urban expansion and farmland abandonment and, as a consequence, land take due to anthropogenic pressure and woodland expansion as the main LD process. The reduction of food production was identified as the most relevant provisioning service affected. SLM should envisage best practices finalized to water saving and soil consumption reduction: efficient irrigation solutions, climate smart agriculture and zero sealing practices. This study highlights the diagnostic value of the suggested approach where LD processes are elicited from land change trajectories determining specific impacts on ES and providing operational support for the implementation of SLM options.

N2  - The purpose of the module is to demonstrate how scientific information can make a big difference in proper understanding of the differences in WS impacts across projects and sites. The module presents scientific information in an easy-to-understand format. Concepts are explained and applied and implications discussed making the module highly practice oriented. Rich scientific information on case study sites is presented in detail to help visualize the case study characteristics clearly so that the learners can relate the information to sites they are familiar with. Toward the end of the module, learners will be exposed to a decision support tool that can be run on Microsoft Excel, which is designed to assist in water resource planning for watershed at the mesoscale. It can also be used for assessing changing land use and climate regimes within the watershed. The tools help in exploring recharge interventions, changes in cropping patterns, and irrigation practices.

N2  - One of the key strategies to alleviate negative impacts of climate change on crop production is the development of new cultivars better adapted to the conditions expected in the future. Despite the role of legumes as protein sources, medium- and long-term strategies currently debated mainly focus on agricultural policies and on improved management practices, whereas ideotyping studies using climate projections are scarcely reported. The objective of this study was to define pea ideotypes improved for yield and irrigation water productivity targeting current climate and four future projections centred on 2040, resulting from the combination of two General Circulation Models (HadGEM2 and GISS-ES) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The STICS model was used, with the default pea parameterization refined using data from two years of dedicated field experiments. Ideotypes were defined by combining STICS and the E-FAST sensitivity analysis method focusing on model parameters representing traits on which breeding programs are ongoing. Results showed that climate change is expected to decrease the productivity of current pea cultivars (up to -12.6%), and that increasing irrigation (to cope with the expected less favourable rainfall distribution) would not avoid yield losses. The proposed ideotypes, characterized by a shorter vegetative phase and by increased tolerance to high temperature, performed better than current varieties, providing higher yields (+4.5%) and reduced water consumption (-20%). For the first time, we demonstrated the suitability of STICS for ideotyping purposes and used a simulation model to define pea breeding strategies targeting future climate conditions.

N2  - Predicting Eucalyptus plantation productivity in the face of climate change is a key challenge for intensively managed forest plantations around the world. Forest industry tree improvement and advanced silvicultural programs are charged with maximizing forest production but face challenging selection choices where Eucalyptus genotypes may be sensitive to genetic × environment interactions (GxE). Our study investigated the importance of GXE interactions by measuring the early (establishment to 2.6 years old) cumulative growth response of 30 selected genotypes of Eucalyptus globulus, E. nitens, E. badjensis, E. smithii, E. nitens × globulus and E. camaldulensis × globulus hybrid seedlings established across contrasting water availability conditions (High vs Low Irrigation). We compared the same genotypes at a low vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and clayey soil (North site) and a high VPD sandy soil (South site) in order to evaluate the stability of these genotypes across environmental gradients and thus evaluate the importance of genetic versus environmental impacts on growth. Stand growth was evaluated at 2.6 years when leaf area index (LAI) reached canopy closure in order to estimate a growth efficiency relationship (GE) with current annual increment (CAI). As expected, irrigation increased cumulative growth and LAI for all taxas, except for E. smithii at the North site. Genotypes showed large significant differences of performance within and across sites under each irrigation treatment. However, a strong relationship between North and South cumulative volume at age 2.6 years was observed for irrigated genotypes but not for non-irrigated genotypes. This suggests that a large GxE interaction may be expected under low water resource availability conditions associated with strong effects in ranking change of evaluated taxas and genotypes. Comparing taxas with at least two genotypes or more in our experiment, GE increased under High Irrigation for all taxas across sites. However, E. nitens × globulus hybrids showed small differences between High vs Low Irrigation treatments GE relationships compared to E. nitens and E. globulus genotypes. Our results suggest the need for strategic allocation of genotypes to contrasting drought risk environments and the need to assess our understanding of how particular genotypes interact with water stress conditions.

N2  - A fertile discussion is developing in the EU regarding the application of the Water Framework Directive (60/2000) (WFD), the legislative act that provides the framework for water regulation in Europe and emphasises the role of economic instruments in water policy. The objective of this paper is to provide an evaluation of different instruments designed to deal with the management of water for agriculture, in the perspective of WFD implementation and agricultural price scenarios. The paper focuses on the regulation of mixed source unmetered water and carries out a comparison of flat rate versus differentiated contracts as the policy instrument. The analysis is based on a combination of linear programming and a Principal-Agent model. The empirical model is applied in an agricultural area of Northern Italy. The results show the feasibility of incentive-oriented policy instruments, even in the less sophisticated form of flat rate area payments. They also show the relevance of agricultural market scenarios and policy scenarios in the design of the optimal policy instruments. The adoption of such instruments, however, could require a revision of the role of different institutions involved in water management.

N2  - Gated flexible or ``layflat{''} fluming is used in furrow irrigation to
supply water to individual furrows. Laboratory experiments were
conducted to establish the flow characteristics of these pipes under the
low heads and high flow rates typical of furrow irrigation of cotton in
Australia. Two different diameters of layflat were used in the study,
222.8 and 425 mm. Proprietary 50 mm diameter outlets (gates) were
installed in the layflat at 1 m spacings. Tests were conducted at
various pressures and flow rates to determine; the geometric
characteristics of the fluming and their relationship to pressure, the
friction loss coefficient for the fluming with and without the outlets
installed, and the head-discharge characteristic for the outlets. It was
shown that the fluming is capable of supplying the desired flow rates
(about 6 1 s(-1) per furrow) at pressure heads <1 m. The head-discharge
characteristic for the proprietary outlets followed a similar form to
the standard orifice equation. No evidence was found to suggest that the
velocity head played any significant role in determining the outlet
discharge. The Hazen-Williams coefficient (C-HW) of the fluming with the
outlets installed was a low 80 compared to a value of about 140 for the
fluming without gates. This clearly illustrates the increase in energy
losses caused by the protrusion of the gates into the flow and that
these losses far exceed the losses due simply to pipe friction. These
experimentally derived coefficients and characteristic equations were
used to validate the simulation program GPIPE. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published

N2  - While adaptation interventions offer a window of opportunity to mitigate the susceptibility of mango seedlings to adverse impact of climate variability and change, there is a scarcity of information on how mango seedlings producers respond to climate variability and change in Ghana. Using a qualitative case study with 20 mango seedlings producers selected through purposive and snowball sampling techniques, this study investigates participants’ knowledge and experience of climate variability and change, the effects of the observed changes on mango seedlings and the adaptation strategies employed to counter the risks associated with climate variability and change in a mango production zone of Ghana. Results indicate that floods, droughts, rising temperature, erratic rainfall and windstorm have been observed among the participants, which negatively affect the survival, growth, establishment and quality of mango seedlings. Adaptation strategies, such as creating gutters, applying agrochemicals, grafting and improved seed varieties, planting of trees as shades, irrigation and soil improvement techniques including mulching, have been implemented by the participants to mitigate climate variability and change effects. The practical and policy implications of the results are discussed and recommendations provided.

N2  - CONTEXT
Millions of people living in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) of India engage in agriculture to support their livelihoods yet are income poor, and food and climate insecure. To address these challenges, policymakers and development programs invest in irrigation-led agricultural intensification. However, the evidence for agricultural intensification to lift farmers' incomes above the poverty line remains largely anecdotal.
OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this study is to use a large household survey (n = 15,572; rice: 8244, wheat: 7328; 2017/18) to assess the link between agricultural intensification and personal daily incomes from farming (FPDI) in the rice-wheat systems of the EGP – the dominant cropping system of the region.
METHODS
We use the Intensification Benefit Index (IBI), a measure that relates farm size and household size to FPDI, to assess how daily incomes from rice-wheat production change with irrigation-led intensification across the EGP.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Relative to the international poverty line of 1.90 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)$ day−1 and accounting for variations in HH size in the analysis, we found that small farm sizes limit the potential for agricultural intensification from irrigation to transform the poverty status of households in the bottom three quartiles of the IBI. The estimated median FPDI of households with intensified systems in the bottom three quartiles is only 0.51 PPP$ day−1 (a 0.15 PPP$ gain). The median FPDI increases to 2.10 PPP$ day−1 for households in the upper quartile of the IBI distribution (a 0.30 PPP$ gain). Irrigation-led agricultural intensification of rice-wheat systems in the EGP may provide substantial benefits for resilience to climatic change and food security but achieving meaningful poverty reduction will require complementary investments.
SIGNIFICANCE
Transforming the poverty status of most smallholder farmers in the EGP requires diversified portfolios of rural on- and off-farm income-generating opportunities. While bolstering food- and climate security, agronomic intervention programs should consider smallholders' limited monetary incentives to invest in intensification. Irrigation-led agricultural intensification programs and policies should explicitly account for the heterogeneity in household resources, irrigation levels, and degree of dependence on agricultural income.

N2  - Water markets can improve water use efficiency through the transfer of water to users who can obtain the highest marginal return from using it. Existing water markets are implemented among farmers or between farmers and urban water companies or hydropower companies. Several studies have shown that farmers may benefit from trading water mainly in countries where water scarcity is increasing and new water supply projects are either very costly or not possible because of environmental concerns. This paper estimates the potential benefits and losses of implementing water market among farmers and between farmers and urban water company in Tunisia. We used linear programming to examine four separate farm models and an aggregate model. The method is applied to an irrigation area of 4500ha in Northern Tunisia. Results indicate that water trading among farmers would be quite limited and would have a minor impact on farmers’ income. In contrast, the market among farmers and the urban water company offers higher volumes of water trades to urban users and helps increase farmers’ profitability by up to 7.9%. The sale of water to the urban company is accompanied by a decrease in occasional labor by as much as 34.8% and a decrease of up to 17.6% in farmers’ expenditures for inputs and machinery. Additionally, results obtained in this paper show that inter-year storage of irrigation water may be more advantageous than selling water to the urban utility. Whether farmers would opt to sell water or inter-temporarily store it would depend on the establishment of water rights and the empowerment of farmers.

N2  - Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems recycle and reuse runoff to meet demand. RWH may also provide an additional benefit, runoff reduction or capture. Most studies of RWH have focused upon water supply exclusively. We evaluate decentralized RWH systems across a wide range of land uses and locations in Virginia for water supply and runoff capture, using the Rainwater Analysis and Simulation Program (RASP) model. RASP simulates an RWH system using storage volume, roof area, irrigated area, and indoor nonpotable demand as inputs. A lifecycle cost-benefit model of RWH was developed. Water supply and runoff capture reliability were assessed in each simulation. Near-optimal solutions were identified for each case and location using a nonlinear metaheuristic algorithm. While positive net benefits were not achieved in any of the land-use cases or locations, distinct differences were observed. A 20% reliability target was achieved, or nearly so, for commercial, office, and high density residential cases, which also had the lowest runoff capture unit costs. In all cases, water supply reliability was binding. Statistical analysis indicated that costs variability can be characterized by two locations in Virginia; for water supply or runoff capture, three locations are necessary, and within specific locations, some land-uses could be combined. Cost effectiveness analysis of each land use provided a means of identifying least cost solutions for water supply and runoff capture. Net benefits were found to be very sensitive to water and wastewater charges.

N2  - This study examined adopter stages and perceptions associated with urban landscape water conservation innovations in Florida, U.S.A. We used the Diffusion of Innovations theory to identify the current adopter stage for each of 18 different water conservation innovations and evaluated the relationships between Floridians’ perceived characteristics of these innovations and their adoption. We also compared this relationship among the most innovative 10% to that among their less innovative counterparts. Compatibility, trialability, and relative advantage predicted adoption of water conservation innovations overall. When only the most innovative individuals were considered, complexity and observability predicted adoption, while the other three characteristics of innovations (relative advantage, compatibility, and trialability) predicted adoption among less innovative Floridians. The findings provide insight into residential outdoor water conservation and suggest opposite processes of diffusion of water-saving technologies at the earlier and later stages of adoption within a social system. Specifically, more innovative individuals need to perceive that new water-saving innovations are not overly complex and also need to have the opportunity to observe the innovation’s benefits. Less innovative individuals need to have an opportunity to try innovations and need to perceive them as being compatible as well as better than what they have used in the past. These different needs should be integrated into interventions that promote water conservation in residential landscapes.

N2  - Summary
In response to anthropogenic disturbances, alluvial rivers adjust their geometry. The alluvial river channels in the upper Blue Nile basin have been disturbed by human-induced factors since a longtime. This paper examines channel adjustment along a 38-km stretch of the Gumara River which drains towards Lake Tana and then to the Blue Nile. Over a 50years period, agriculture developed rapidly in the catchment and flooding of the alluvial plain has become more frequent in recent times. The objectives of this study were to document the changes in channel planform and cross-section of the Gumara River and to investigate whether the changes could have contributed to the frequent flooding or vice versa. Two sets of aerial photographs (1957 and 1980) were scanned, and then orthorectified. Recent channel planform information was extracted from SPOT images of 2006 and Google Earth. Channel planform and bed morphology (vertical changes) were determined for these nearly 50years period. The vertical changes were determined based on aggradation along a permanent structure, historic information on river cross-sections at a hydrological gauging station, and field observations. The results indicate that the lower reach of Gumara near its mouth has undergone major planform changes. A delta with approx. 1.12km2 of emerged land was created between 1957 and 1980 and an additional 1km2 of land has been added between 1980 and 2006. The sinuosity of the river changed only slightly: negatively (−1.1% i.e. meandering decreased) for the period from 1957 to 1980 and positively (+3.0%) for the period 1980–2006. Comparison of cross-sections at the hydrological gauging station showed that the deepest point in the river bed aggraded by 2.91m for the period 1963–2009. The importance of sediment deposition in the stream and on its banks is related to land degradation in the upper catchment, and to artificial rising of Lake Tana level that creates a backwater effect and sediment deposition in Gumara River. Direct anthropogenic impacts (irrigation activities and building of dykes along the river banks) have contributed to the huge deposition in the river bed. Where the abstraction of water for irrigation is intensive, seepage water through the banks has contributed to river bank failure. In general, this study showed that changes to the planform at the mouth of the river and to the riverbed level are substantial. Moreover, the study indicated that the flood carrying capacity of the Gumara River channel has diminished in recent times.

N2  - An integrated assessment of the potential of different management
practices for mitigating specific components of the total GHG budget
(N2O and CH4 emissions and C sequestration) of Mediterranean agrosystems
was performed in this study. Their suitability regarding both yield and
environmental (e.g. nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization)
sustainability, and regional barriers and opportunities for their
implementation were also considered. Based on its results best
strategies to abate GHG emissions in Mediterranean agro-systems were
proposed. Adjusting N fertilization to crop needs in both irrigated and
rain-fed systems could reduce N2O emissions up to 50% compared with a
non-adjusted practice. Substitution of N synthetic fertilizers by solid
manure can be also implemented in those systems, and may abate N2O
emissions by about 20% under Mediterranean conditions, with additional
indirect benefits associated to energy savings and positive effects in
crop yields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors enhances N
use efficiency of the cropping systems and may mitigate N2O emissions up
to 80% and 50%, respectively. The type of irrigation may also have a
great mitigation potential in the Mediterranean region. Drip-irrigated
systems have on average 80% lower N2O emissions than sprinkler systems
and drip-irrigation combined with optimized fertilization showed a
reduction in direct N2O emissions up to 50%. Methane fluxes have a
relatively small contribution to the total GHG budget of Mediterranean
crops, which can mostly be controlled by careful management of the water
table and organic inputs in paddies. Reduced soil tillage, improved
management of crop residues and agro-industry by-products, and cover
cropping in orchards, are the most suitable interventions to enhance
organic C stocks in Mediterranean agricultural soils. The adoption of
the proposed agricultural practices will require farmers training. The
global analysis of life cycle emissions associated to irrigation type
(drip, sprinkle and furrow) and N fertilization rate (100 and 300 kg N
ha(-1) yr(-1)) revealed that these factors may outweigh the reduction in
GHG emissions beyond the plot scale. The analysis of the impact of some
structural changes on top-down mitigation of GHG emissions revealed that
3-15% of N2O emissions could be suppressed by avoiding food waste at
the end-consumer level. A 40% reduction in meat and dairy consumption
could reduce GHG emissions by 20-30%. Reintroducing the Mediterranean
diet (i.e. similar to 35% intake of animal protein) would therefore
result in a significant decrease of GHG emissions from agricultural
production systems under Mediterranean conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier

N2  - This paper provides an ex-ante assessment of the impacts of climate and
price variability on household income and food security in Ethiopia and
Ghana. The study applies an agent-based modelling approach to highlight
the role of coping and adaptation strategies under climate and price
variability. Our simulation results show that climate and price
variability adversely affects income and food security of households in
both countries. Self-coping mechanisms are found to be important but
insufficient to mitigate the adverse effects of variability, implying
the need for policy interventions. Adaptation strategies composed of a
portfolio of actions such as the provision of production credit and
access to improved seeds are found to be effective in reducing the
impacts of climate and price variability in Ethiopia. Similarly, policy
interventions aimed at improving the provision of short-term production
credit along with the existing irrigation facilities are important in
Ghana. Finally, this study highlights the importance of capturing the
distributional aspects of adaptation options by highlighting
heterogeneous effects of variability and adaptation options. (C) 2017

N2  - The shock of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted food
systems worldwide. Such disruption, affecting multiple systems
interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be
understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of
causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes
unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways
is critical to identify present and future systems intervention
strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present
and future impact created by the pandemic and ?Amphan? cyclonic storm on
smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of
the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of
intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the
pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems
through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It
provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to
understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm
households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with
multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify
the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and
later compounded by ?Amphan?. The immediate adaptation strategies of the
farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring
farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations,
replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of
waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements,
such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others,
through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on
these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive
Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the
smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental
models indicated the centrality of ?Kharif? (monsoon) rice production,
current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine
the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current
household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central
elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple
stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household
income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected
soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to
enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic.
This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention
strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological
approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological
systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on
collective wisdom of stakeholders.

N2  - Jordan has scarce and declining forest resources. Its low and variable rainfall has dictated the use of drought-tolerant species such as Pinus halepensis Mill. (Pinaceae) in rainfed forestation programs. We hypothesized that treated wastewater can be used to improve survival and growth of forest seedlings, and to diversify forestations. A split-plot experimental design was utilized to examine the effect of water regime (rainfed, municipal-treated wastewater, and freshwater) on seedlings’ survival and growth of eight forest species for 2 years. Irrigation improved survival rate of all evaluated species compared to rainfed conditions. Although irrigation was stopped during the second year, a lingering effect of irrigation treatment was observed. Moreover, wastewater irrigation resulted in comparable survival rates to those of freshwater, suggesting that wastewater can be used to improve forestation success. Survival rates under wastewater irrigation were noticed to vary by species. Seedlings growth and leaf N content were significantly greater under wastewater as compared to freshwater treatment, indicating that wastewater provided water as well as nutrients. Under rainfed condition, Juniperus phoenicea had the highest survival rate as compared to all other species, which suggests that forestation projects species diversity could be improved even under rainfed conditions.

N2  - Water desalination is a proposed solution for mitigating the effects of drought, soil salinization, and the ecological impacts of agricultural drainage. In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70–90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology. The ecosystem service benefits of reduced agricultural drainage would need to be valued between $800 and $1200 per acre-foot, or nearly the full capital and operational costs of water desalination, for the net benefits of water desalination to be positive from a societal perspective.

N2  - Summary
Some of the world’s key agricultural production systems face big challenges to both water quantity and quality due to shallow groundwater that results from long-term intensive irrigation, namely waterlogging and salinity, water losses, and environmental problems. This paper focuses on water quantity issues, presenting finite-difference groundwater models developed to describe shallow water table levels, non-beneficial groundwater consumptive use, and return flows to streams across two regions within an irrigated alluvial river valley in southeastern Colorado, USA. The models are calibrated and applied to simulate current baseline conditions in the alluvial aquifer system and to examine actions for potentially improving these conditions. The models provide a detailed description of regional-scale subsurface unsaturated and saturated flow processes, thereby enabling detailed spatiotemporal description of groundwater levels, recharge to infiltration ratios, partitioning of ET originating from the unsaturated and saturated zones, and groundwater flows, among other variables. Hybrid automated and manual calibration of the models is achieved using extensive observations of groundwater hydraulic head, groundwater return flow to streams, aquifer stratigraphy, canal seepage, total evapotranspiration, the portion of evapotranspiration supplied by upflux from the shallow water table, and irrigation flows. Baseline results from the two regional-scale models are compared to model predictions under variations of four alternative management schemes: (1) reduced seepage from earthen canals, (2) reduced irrigation applications, (3) rotational lease fallowing (irrigation water leased to municipalities, resulting in temporary dry-up of fields), and (4) combinations of these. The potential for increasing the average water table depth by up to 1.1 and 0.7m in the two respective modeled regions, thereby reducing the threat of waterlogging and lowering non-beneficial consumptive use from adjacent fallow and naturally-vegetated lands, is demonstrated for the alternative management intervention scenarios considered. Net annual average savings of up to about 9.9 million m3 (8000 ac ft) and 2.3 million m3 (1900 ac ft) of non-beneficial groundwater consumptive use is demonstrated for the study periods in each of the two respective study regions. Alternative water management interventions achieve varying degrees of benefits in each of the two regions, suggesting a need to adopt region-specific interventions and avoid a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. Impacts of the considered interventions on return flows to the river were predicted to be significant, highlighting the need for flow augmentation to comply with an interstate river compact and portending beneficial impacts on solute loading.

N2  - Solar photovoltaic systems have become one of the most popular topics in the water management industry. Moreover, irrigation networks are water- and energy-hungry, and utility managers are likely to adapt water consumption (and consequently energy demand) to the hours in which there is energy availability. In countries such as Spain (with high irradiance values), solar energy is an available green alternative characterised by zero electricity costs and significantly lower environmental impact. In this work, several types of irrigation scheduled programmes (according to different irrigation sectors) that minimise the number of photovoltaic solar panels to be installed are studied; moreover, the effects of the variable costs linked to energy (energy and emissions costs) are presented. Finally, the effect of incorporating batteries for storing energy to protect the system against emergencies, such as unfavourable weather, is proposed. The irrigation hours available to satisfy water demands are limited by sunlight; they are also limited by the condition that the irrigation schedule type has to be rigid (predetermined rotation) and that the pressure at any node has to be above minimum pressure required by standards. A real case study is performed, and the results obtained demonstrate that there is no universal solution; this is because the portfolio of alternatives is based on investments for purchasing equipment at present and also on future energy savings (revenues). Apart from these two values, there is an economic value (equivalent discontinuous discount rate), which also influences the final results.

N2  - Summary
Sources of pollution in river basins are increasing due to rapid changes in land uses and excessive nutrient application to crops which lead to degraded instream water quality. In this connection, the Mun River basin, one of the important and largest river basins in Thailand, has been studied. Comparative figures of nutrients in the Mun’s water over a decade showed an increased total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) ratio in the Lower Mun region (TN:TP>14). Laboratory analysis of weekly water samples showed a realistic nutrient response when daily rainfall was compared to the seasonal water quality data collected by the Pollution Control Department (PCD). The Hydrologic Simulation Program – FORTRAN (HSPF) was calibrated and used to assess the effects of different land uses on river water quality. Model parameters related to hydrology and sediment were calibrated and validated using relevant measurements by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). With a reasonable and acceptable model performance (r2=0.62), the highest simulated runoff was observed in urban areas. The trend of agricultural land (as a percentage of total area) – total nitrogen showed a linear relationship of a good correlation (i.e. r2=0.85). Based on the findings, it can be concluded that this model is expected to provide vital information for developing suitable land management policies and strategies to improve river water quality.

N2  - Existing methods for applying the planetary boundary concept in life cycle assessment are not sufficiently spatially and temporally resolved. Here, we develop a new method for freshwater use based on the safe operating space (SOS) at watershed-level. The SOS is based on the concept of environmental flow requirements, which is the share of mean monthly flow that should be reserved to achieve or maintain “fair conditions” of aquatic ecosystems. The method is composed of two steps. First, water consumption is multiplied by a characterization factor, which converts it to an environmental impact, expressed as an area-equivalent of a watershed’s mean monthly flow. Second, the environmental impact is compared to an assigned share of SOS to determine if the activity causing it can be considered environmentally sustainable, with respect to a chosen principle for sharing the SOS. The method is demonstrated for a case study on water consumed for irrigation in open-field tomato production in 27 watersheds, spanning 10 countries and 5 continents, based on data for 316 farms in the year 2014. Water consumption was modelled from crop characteristics, climatic data and the assumed type of irrigation system. Two principles, “status quo” and “gross value added”, were illustratively applied for the assignment of SOS to 1 tonne of tomatoes. The characterization factors developed span two orders of magnitude from 10th to 90th percentile, which shows the relevance of a spatially and temporally explicit assessment. In the case study, the characterization factors largely determine the high variability in the resulting environmental impacts between watersheds, which ranged from 400 m2 to 50,000 m2 per tonne of tomatoes. The analysis would suggest that the freshwater use by current tomato farming is environmentally sustainable in all months in a maximum of 2 of the 27 watersheds with respect to the two principles applied for sharing the SOS. The method can be used as a basis to identify potential “planetary boundary hotspots” in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. Two key challenges are the lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data in current life cycle inventories and the choice of sharing principle for assigning the SOS.

N2  - Due to high demand for aesthetically pleasing urban landscapes from continually increasing population in Florida, new methods must be explored for outdoor water conservation. Three brands of evapotranspiration (ET) controllers were selected based on positive water savings results in arid climates. ET controllers were evaluated on irrigation application compared to a time clock schedule intended to mimic homeowner irrigation schedules. Three ET controllers were tested: Toro Intelli-sense; ETwater Smart Controller 100; Weathermatic SL1600. Other time-based treatments were TIME, based on the historical net irrigation requirement and RTIME that was 60% of TIME. Each treatment was replicated four times for a total of twenty St. Augustinegrass plots which were irrigated through individual irrigation systems. Treatments were compared to each other and to a time-based schedule without rain sensor (TIME WORS) derived from TIME. The study period, August 2006 through November 2007, was dry compared to 30-year historical average rainfall. The ET controllers averaged 43% water savings compared to a time-based treatment without a rain sensor and were about twice as effective and reducing irrigation compared to a rain sensor alone. There were no differences in turfgrass quality across all treatments over the 15-month study. The controllers adjusted their irrigation schedules to the climatic demand effectively, with maximum savings of 60% during the winter 2006–2007 period and minimum savings of 9% during spring 2007 due to persistent dry conditions. RTIME had similar savings to the ET controllers compared to TIME WORS indicating that proper adjustment of time clocks could result in substantial irrigation savings. However, the ET controllers would offer consistent savings once programmed properly.

N2  - One of the most commonly employed water conservation strategies is to restrict lawn watering to limited times on specified days. Water managers typically assume that limiting the frequency and duration of lawn watering will reduce water use. Consequently, the effectiveness of water restrictions is often evaluated based on observed compliance to the specified schedule, whether or not actual reductions in water use are achieved. This assessment approach is more practical than quantifying the reduction in water use brought about by restrictions because quantification of lawn water use is hampered by difficulties in disaggregating the various components of residential water use. Dual meters to separately meter the portion of public supply devoted to lawn water use are rare, and for households that withdraw water from private wells, canals, or ponds for lawn watering, there is no record of such water use at all. As a consequence of this gap in water use data, compliance to a prescribed frequency of watering is often equated with effectiveness. In this paper we develop an alternative metric for evaluating the effectiveness of water restrictions and present a case study in a suburban area in Southeast Florida that illustrates some of the challenges of quantifying lawn water use and explores some of the limitations of day of the week water restrictions as a conservation strategy.

N2  - The impacts of climate change on the irrigation water requirements and yield of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) grown in England have been assessed, by combining the downscaled outputs from an ensemble of general circulation models (GCM) with a potato crop growth model. The SUBSTOR-Potato model (embedded within the DSSAT program) was used to simulate the baseline and future irrigation needs (mm) and yield (tha−1) for selected emissions scenario (SRES A1FI and B1) for the 2050s, including CO2 fertilisation effects. The simulated baseline yields were validated against independent experimental and field data using four reference sites. Probabilistic distribution functions and histograms were derived to assess GCM modelling uncertainty on future irrigation needs. Assuming crop husbandry factors are unchanged, farm yields would show only marginal increases (3–6%) due to climate change owing to limitations in nitrogen availability. In contrast, future potential yields, without restrictions in water or fertiliser, are expected to increase by 13–16%. Future average irrigation needs, assuming unconstrained water availability, are predicted to increase by 14–30%, depending on emissions scenario. The present ‘design’ capacity for irrigation infrastructure would fail to meet future peak irrigation needs in nearly 50% of years. Adaptation options for growers to cope with these impacts are discussed.

N2  - This study aimed to quantify the variability in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, also called carbon footprint (CF), of open-field tomato production in Iran. Three main emission sources, i.e. material and energy use, biogenic sources, and fertilizer application were evaluated. To this end, data on tomato cultivation from 204 open-field tomato farms in two provinces of Alborz and East Azerbaijan in Iran were obtained using face-to-face questionnaires with tomato farmers. The average CF was 0.2 kg CO2-eq per kg tomatoes produced, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 kg CO2-eq (kg tomato)−1 (5–95 percentile range). Material and energy use contributed most to the total emissions (on average 60%), mainly as a result of fertilizer production and energy required for irrigation. The variability in the tomato yield exerted the largest influence on the variation of CF (47%), followed by variability in fertilizer application (22%) and differences in biogenic emissions between the two provinces (21%). Farms in the Alborz region showed systematically smaller CFs than farms in the East-Azerbaijan region due to the use of modern irrigation systems, less fertilizer use and higher yields. The application of modern irrigation systems and provision of training programs on chemical fertilizer use (soil analysis for farmland N content, crop rotation, and crop rotation with legumes) for open-field tomato farms can help to reduce the CF of tomato production in Iran.

N2  - Concentrations and retention of pharmaceutically active substances are crucial for assessing the environmental risk of medication of humans. We hypothesize that environmental introduction concentrations (EICs) of drugs in the Mexico City–Mezquital Valley wastewater irrigation system can be estimated using information on water consumption, sales data, and excretion rates. EICs of six acidic and five basic drugs were calculated and compared with concentrations measured in wastewater, irrigation water, soil drainage, and springs by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS/MS). EICs of trimethoprim, erythromycin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in sewage equaled or exceeded the US FDA action limit of 1μg/L for detailed environmental risk assessment (ERA). Concentrations of clarithromycin, clindamycin, metoprolol, sulfasalazine, bezafibrate, and gemfibrozil were smaller. Calculated EICs of all compounds except metoprolol and clarithromycin were comparable to measured concentrations if excretion rates were considered. Whereas concentrations of basic compounds with positive or neutral charges were effectively reduced during reservoir storage and soil passage, acidic, anionic compounds were hardly retained. Though realistic EICs can be predicted for most substances, large deviations between EICs and measured concentrations in the case of metoprolol illustrate that estimated concentrations cannot substitute for monitoring programs.

N2  - Water is increasingly becoming scarce due to competing demands from agriculture, industry, recreation and the environment. With increased concerns regarding climate change and environmental water demand, system managers and irrigators are being forced to consider deficit-irrigation options. This study illustrates the potentials of deficit irrigation as an effective adaptive response to climate change and environmental water demand in achieving efficiency gains, water saving and maximizing benefits that could be achieved at system level. We compared three scenarios: optimization with full irrigation, optimization with deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation without optimization. A non-linear optimization model, which uses crop production function and profit functions endogenously, was used to evaluate the potential of deficit irrigation. The results show that optimization with deficit irrigation could result in both environmental flows and maximizing net returns objectives, increase overall water use efficiency, and therefore offer an effective adaptive response against climate change. We envisage deficit irrigation could be used as a cost-effective adaptive response for meeting climate and environmental objectives. Water saved through deficit irrigation could be used to restore environmental balance through augmenting environmental flows.

N2  - Summary
The need to adapt irrigation patterns to water shortages in the world’s dry regions continues to inspire economically attractive measures to sustain food security and improve farm incomes. Ongoing evidence of climate variability and growing populations amplify the importance of this search. Motivated by recent severe drought in the southwestern United States, this study analyzes vulnerability, impacts, and adaptability by irrigation technology in a sub-basin of North America’s Rio Grande. The study accounts for economic incentives affecting choices on irrigation technology, crop mix, and water source in the face of water conservation subsidies under various levels of surface water shortage. Findings show that when surface water supplies are reduced, farmers shift to aquifer pumping even when pumping raises the cost of production or reduces yield. An important on-farm drought adaptation mechanism comes by converting from surface irrigation to water conserving irrigation technologies when faced with lower financial costs for conversion. Public subsidies to convert from flood to drip irrigation offset many of the negative impacts of drought on farm income. These subsidies also raise the value of food production, reduce the amount of water applied to crops, but can increase crop water depletions. Our approach for analyzing drought adaptation impacts and adjustment mechanisms can be applied where water shortages loom, food security is important, and water conservation policies are under debate. Results provide insights for the design of adaptation mechanisms for the world’s dry regions for which policymakers need to reduce economic damages from future climate variability and change.

N2  - Understanding functional relations among plant traits and their modulation by growing conditions is imperative in designing selection strategies for breeding programs. This study assessed trait relationships among 196 common bean genotypes exposed to stresses for drought and field infestation of bean fly or bean stem maggot (BSM). The study was carried out at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype×trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root pulling resistance, pod harvest index, pods per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through pod harvest index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root pulling resistance and pod harvest index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and BSM tolerance evaluation.

N2  - This study has developed and applied a planning support system (PSS) – a tool for planners to analyze and choose the best policy instrument in order to adapt to climate change in the Qazvin irrigation and drainage network, located in the central part of Iran that is mainly supplied by the Taleghan reservoir. A comprehensive weather generator was developed that was capable of regenerating statistical characteristics and linear correlation between neighboring stations. After downscaling monthly outputs from General Circulation Models (GCMs) using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method, the weather generator was used to generate daily time series for the base case and projected climate change scenarios. This study simulated the Taleghan reservoir daily inflow under projected climate change scenarios using the data fusion method where outputs from the most representative Artificial Neural Networks and Hammerstein–Wiener models were “fused” to simulate the reservoir daily inflow. Results showed a decrease in mean daily inflow in almost all months. Biophysical input coefficients were estimated using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop models under all climate scenarios. The projected production of all studied crops can vary between 86% and 122% of the potential production under the base-case scenario. In addition, it was revealed that the net irrigation requirement for crops will decrease by 12% on an average. The main goal of the PSS was to maximize the total net income for the region. It can be concluded that reducing bank loan interest rate and setting two different water prices for surface and pressurized irrigation systems can be seen as the best management practices in the region.

N2  - Groundwater withdrawal by desalination plants might lead to a drop of the piezometric levels of aquifers, causing negative impacts, especially in water-dependent ecosystems. Management strategies are necessary to overcome these potential problems, particularly in abandoned solar saltworks—wetlands which are particularly prone to degradation by desiccation. This paper reports the soil–vegetation relationships in one of these wetlands (Agua Amarga salt marsh, SE Spain), in which a pioneer programme of irrigation with seawater is applied to correct the environmental impacts of two desalination plants. Depth of water level and soil Eh, bulk density, moisture and salinity were determined in December 2011 and June and October 2012, in 63 plots from 12 different environments/types of vegetation. Multivariate analyses were used to identify gradients, and a model of soil–vegetation relationships was elaborated to contribute to the management of the marsh. Two different situations were identified: the periphery (drier and less saline soils) and the abandoned saline ponds (wetter and more saline soils). The three environments/types of vegetation of the periphery (Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp. stands) were separated according to the seasonal behaviour of soil salinity and moisture, regardless of the irrigation programme. Hence, modifications in the vegetation distribution should be mainly attributable to environmental factors, including possible consequences of climate change. The nine environments/types of vegetation of the abandoned saline ponds (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum growing in patches with and without the presence of seedlings, bare soils among A. macrostachyum patches, mixed stands with S. fruticosa and A. macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, flooded ponds with Ruppia maritima, Phragmites australis and a burned zone) were separated mainly according to soil moisture, water level in the soil profile, Eh and salinity. In this zone, vegetation can be used as a bioindicator to detect the consequences of the irrigation programme, which should be carefully managed if biodiversity and habitat variety have to be preserved. Our results indicate that the amount of seawater pumped is a critical issue and must be planned taking into account not only the vegetation but also the current soil properties such as bulk density (that influences water infiltration and retention) and salinity (mainly determined by the salts that remain in the soils due to the former use of the ponds as solar saltworks).

N2  - In Georgia and many other southeastern states in the USA, the amount of water used by agriculture for irrigation is largely unknown due to the lack of reporting requirements. Recent droughts and a water dispute with the neighboring states that include Alabama and Florida have highlighted the need for an accurate estimate of water use by agriculture. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a crop simulation model combined with kriging for estimating the spatial distribution of the monthly irrigation water use for cotton in the Coastal Plain region of Georgia. Farmers’ monthly irrigation applications for cotton during the 2002 and 2003 growing seasons were obtained from selected sites of the Agricultural Water Pumping program. We selected 80 fields for 2002 and 51 fields for 2003. For each of these fields, we used the Cropping System Model-CROPGRO-Cotton to simulate farmers’ irrigation applications. Ordinary kriging was used to estimate the spatial distribution of monthly total irrigation in the region. We then compared the spatial and temporal distribution of irrigation amounts predicted by the Cropping System Model-CROPGRO-Cotton with the amount of water that the farmers actually applied. The Cropping System Model-CROPGRO-Cotton simulated the temporal pattern of irrigation applications very well during the growing season. The root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and simulated total irrigation for different months ranged from 5 to 23mm in 2002 and from 2 to 14mm in 2003. The RMSE values were generally higher in 2002 when the irrigation applications across the region were more variable when compared with 2003. Consequently, a better agreement on the spatial distribution of monthly total irrigation for the observed and simulated was obtained for 2003 than for 2002.

N2  - Olive farming represents an important source of income and employment in the rural areas of Andalusia (Spain), which is the most important olive oil-producing region in the world. Unfortunately, it also exerts significant environmental pressures with regard to soil erosion, use of polluting inputs, excessive water consumption and biodiversity reduction. This paper uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques and pressure distance functions to contribute a farm-level assessment of the eco-efficiency of a sample of 292 Andalusian olive farmers. We distinguish between managerial eco-efficiency and program eco-efficiency, the latter being associated to the different natural conditions prevailing in the three main olive cultivation systems in the region, namely, traditional rain-fed mountain groves, traditional rain-fed plain groves and irrigated intensive groves. Our findings show that eco-inefficient management is a widespread practice across olive farmers, mainly due to widespread technical inefficiency. Furthermore, the most eco-efficient production system is the traditional plain growing system. Finally, we find that soil-climate conditions strongly influence managerial eco-efficiency in all three aforementioned cultivation systems.

N2  - The invasive tree Melaleuca quinquenervia experienced substantial declines in growth and reproduction in response to chronic herbivory by the defoliating weevil Oxyops vitiosa. Plants subjected to unrestricted defoliation replaced leaves that were more suitable for feeding by the next generation, a process envisioned by the Resource Regulation Hypothesis which posits that attack by one generation increases the amount of the preferred host resources for the next, resulting in a positive feedback loop for the herbivore. The production of juvenile replacement leaves stimulated additional bouts of oviposition and feeding by O. vitiosa, which ultimately produced positive effects for the herbivore with negative consequences for the plant. The addition of water resources to the plant prolonged the positive feedback loop such that more than twice as many insects were produced on irrigated versus non-irrigated trees. In a more simple, reassembled food web on M. quinquenervia, the lack of biotic constraints like parasitoids may have prevented the earlier termination of the feedback loop and thus increased the impact of the biological control agent on the target. The overall effectiveness of this classical biological control program can be attributed, in part, to the phenomenon of the target plant’s induced susceptible response to a herbivore.

N2  - A significant increase in surface water salinization in low-lying deltas is expected globally due to saline groundwater exfiltration driven by rising sea levels and decreasing freshwater availability. Sustaining fresh water-dependent agriculture in such areas will entail an increased demand for fresh water flushing. Unfortunately, the flushing of surface water is not operationally optimised and results in excessive use of scarce freshwater. To meet the increased demand for flushing, while minimizing the need for diverted freshwater, new operational designs are required. This paper presents a novel network model based approach that uses De Saint Venant (SV) and Advection Dispersion (AD) equations to optimize multiple objectives on water level and salinity control using a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The resulting NMPC problem is solved with a receding horizon implementation, where the nonlinear program (NLP) at each iteration is solved using state-of-the-art large scale interior point solver (IPOPT). We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the traditional fixed flushing for a representative Dutch polder. Firstly, the approach is shown to be capable of controlling the water level and salinity level in the polder. Secondly, the results highlight that the network of canals, which were originally made for drainage, could not be made sufficiently fresh with current intake capacity. A simple design approach was used to identify appropriate new capacities for two of the gates that allow optimal flushing to guarantee the required water level and salinity constraints.

N2  - Short-term perspectives appear to be relevant in formulating adaptation
measures to changed climate variability (CCV) as a part of the European
Rural Development Policy (RDP). Indeed, short-run CCV is the variation
that farmers would perceive to such an extent that a political demand
would be generated for adapting support measures. This study evaluates
some relevant agronomic and economic impacts of CCV as modelled in a
near future time period at the catchment scale in a rural district in
Sardinia (Italy). The effects of CCV are assessed in relation to the
availability of irrigation water and the irrigation needs of maize.
The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was used to
simulate the impact of key climatic variables on the irrigation water
requirements and yields of maize. A three-stage discrete stochastic
programming model was then applied to simulate management and economic
responses to those changes.
The overall economic impact of a simulated CCV was found to be primarily
caused by reduced stability in the future supply of irrigation water.
Adaptations to this instability will most likely lead to a higher level
of groundwater extraction and a reduction in the demand for labour.
Changed climate variability will most likely reduce the income potential
of small-scale farming. The most CCV-vulnerable farm typologies were
identified, and the implications were discussed in relation to the
development of adaptation measures within the context of the Common
Agricultural Policy of European Union. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Water management is becoming commonplace in discussions of high-yield farming and modern agricultural best practices. A field experiment undertaken in the Northern region of Egypt, Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, with four cut-off furrow irrigation treatments (100%, full irrigation – considered as a control; 90%, 80% and 70% of strip length) was used to compare the effects of reduced water supply on onion (Allium cepa, L.) production via assessing three different cultivars (e.g., Giza red, Giza 20 and Behairy red). A strip-plot design with three replicates was employed in this regard during two successive seasons (2014–2015/2015–2016). Regardless of onion type, water supply at 80% level resulted in higher marketable and total bulb yield (t/ha) with improved quality traits and storability compared to other irrigation treatments. There have been few significant interspecies differences. The most notable significant differences were recorded in Giza red and Behairy red for all studied characteristics. The highest results were reached with Giza red under the use of 80% irrigation level. In addition to the excellence in improving the overall quality and harvestable yield, this treatment (80% watering) has produced relatively good results with respect to the consumptive water-use efficiency, water productivity and showed significant benefits in terms of saving irrigation water. Maximum water saving was obtained under the use of 70% irrigation treatment, but in the absence of a good and economically unacceptable yield. The traditional technique (100% water supply) consumed much water, surpassing the most effective treatment (80%) by 1195.77 cubic meter per hectare (i.e., 11.96 cm in depth/height). In conclusion, cut-off irrigation technique is considered an efficient and effective intervention approach for onion yield increases while maintaining post-harvesting quality and water savings. However, extending the study beyond onion is critical to increase the range of benefit with regard to other crops, as well for adequate management of water under deficit irrigation conditions.

N1  - Special Section: Integrating Water and Agricultural Management Under Climate Change
N2  - Given the high proportion of water used for agriculture in certain regions, the economic value of agricultural water can be an important tool for water management and policy development. This value is quantified using economic demand curves for irrigation water. Such demand functions show the incremental contribution of water to agricultural production. Water demand curves are estimated using econometric or optimisation techniques. Calibrated agricultural optimisation models allow the derivation of demand curves using smaller datasets than econometric models. This paper introduces these subject areas then explores the effect of spatial aggregation (upscaling) on the valuation of water for irrigated agriculture. A case study from the Rio Grande–Rio Bravo Basin in North Mexico investigates differences in valuation at farm and regional aggregated levels under four scenarios: technological change, warm-dry climate change, changes in agricultural commodity prices, and water costs for agriculture. The scenarios consider changes due to external shocks or new policies. Positive mathematical programming (PMP), a calibrated optimisation method, is the deductive valuation method used. An exponential cost function is compared to the quadratic cost functions typically used in PMP. Results indicate that the economic value of water at the farm level and the regionally aggregated level are similar, but that the variability and distributional effects of each scenario are affected by aggregation. Moderately aggregated agricultural production models are effective at capturing average-farm adaptation to policy changes and external shocks. Farm-level models best reveal the distribution of scenario impacts.

N2  - Biofertilizers are an important source for completing the plant nutrition program, which has a significant effect on reducing the cost and adverse effects of chemical fertilizers and increasing plant resistance to environmental stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Nitroxine and nitrogen biofertilizer on grain yield, nitrogen utilization and use efficiency, nitrogen remobilization and plant water use efficiency in Nigella sativa (black cumin) grown under different irrigation regimes. The experiment was conducted at Yasouj University Research Field in split plots in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2016 and 2018. Factors studied in this experiment consisted of four irrigation regimes (based on phenological stages) including weekly irrigation from emergence to harvest (WI0) and withholding irrigation from blooming to maturity (WIb), from flowering to maturity (WIf), and from the start of grain formation to maturity (WIs) as a main factor and five levels of fertilizer including no application of fertilizers (N0), 80 kg N ha−1 (N80), 40 kg N ha−1 (N40), combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizer (N40 + B), and Nitroxin biofertilizer (B) as sub factors. Application of 80 kg N ha-1 in complete irrigation, and combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizers in other irrigation regimes were associated with greatest grain yield, N content in aerial organs and water use efficiency. In all irrigation regimes, combination of 40 kg N ha-1+Nitroxin biofertilizers resulted in the greatest N remobilization (N already has been stored in the vegetative organs, transferred to the developing grains) rate (12.46 kg ha-1). The greatest N utilization efficiency was obtained in non-fertilizer treatments (15.1 kg kg-1) and withholding irrigation from flowering stage (15.7 kg kg-1). Finally, the results showed that the application of nitroxin biofertilizer can reduce the use of urea chemical fertilizer and mitigate the effects of drought stress by N fixing and possibly producing growth hormones and decrease N utilization and water use efficiency.

N2  - During 1963–-78 the governments and the top universities of Chile and California undertook three programs of binational development assistance and cooperation. The programs built on a long historical relationship between the two regions, marked by their striking similarities in physical geography and natural resources, despite being 1,000s of miles apart on opposite sides of the Equator. The first program was for technical development assistance to Chile in the framework of the Alliance for Progress, and involved the three governments of Chile, California, and the United States. Water resources and river basin development planning were a primary emphasis, and led to building Chile’s largest dual-purpose reservoir (Colbún). The second program was for graduate-level academic exchange and involved the two leading public university systems, the University of Chile and the University of California. This comprehensive program was funded for more than a decade by the Ford Foundation, with agriculture, natural sciences, and engineering the dominant fields. The third program was a separate effort to reform Chilean legal education, led by Stanford Law School and funded by the Ford Foundation. This Chile Law Program was a leading international example of the “law and development” movement in the 1960s, which overlapped closely with the early years of the “law and society” movement in the U.S. Both university and law school programs ended after the Chilean military coup in 1973. What were the impacts of these programs on water, law, and society in both Chile and California? What lessons can we learn today from those historical experiences? We answer these questions with an historical overview and synthesis of diverse documents and evidence. In focusing on water, law, and society, we aim to contribute to the interdisciplinary synthesis of different fields of development studies.

N2  - Potential health risks associated with water used to irrigate fresh produce are increasingly recognized worldwide, leading to the implementation of water quality standards as part of many food safety programs. These standards are generally based on the presence of the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), generic Escherichia coli; however, the persistence and potential growth of this species in the environment suggests current standards may not accurately predict health risks associated with irrigation water. In this context, we evaluated enterococci as an alternate FIB for assessing agricultural water quality under baseflow conditions, which typically coincide with peak demands for supplemental irrigation in the study area. We compared culture-based concentrations of Enterococcus to E. coli over two growing seasons at four different irrigation canals in Alberta, Canada, that historically exceed the E. coli irrigation guideline on a frequent basis. We also examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water, animal feces, and human sewage. Escherichia coli and enterococci were significantly correlated at three of the four canals, although on average, more guideline exceedances and higher mean concentrations of enterococci were reported. Specific differences in FIB dynamics were observed between canals. Most notably, enterococci concentrations were significantly higher than E. coli at one canal, while E. coli concentrations were significantly higher than enterococci at a different canal. Enterococci species distributions were markedly different between irrigation water and animal feces. Enterococci species reportedly associated with plants predominated in irrigation water, whereas these species were absent or present in very low proportions in human sewage and animal feces. Results of this study suggest the limitations of using enterococci for measuring microbial quality of irrigation water are similar to E. coli, in that risk analyses with respect to food safety may be confounded by the presence of environment-associated species and/or strains.

N2  - Water markets in developing countries are difficult to implement due to social, environmental, and technical restrictions. However, the primary concern in irrigation districts with a lack of a functioning market mechanism is the economically efficient allocation of water. In this light, the objective of this study is the development of an Economic-Operational framework that could be used for the most economically efficient allocation of water. This framework is expected to provide an infrastructure for delivering volumetric mutually-related main economic components: Positive Mathematical Programing (PMP) and the Model Predictive Control (MPC) which is added as an operational model component. The economic model (PMP) simulates the existing conditions surrounding the agricultural activities and calculates the agricultural sector’s income, as well as the economic value of water, considering current cropping patterns and the economic value of water. Consequently, the operational model (MPC) distributes and delivers water to the agricultural units based on the weighted average of water’s economic value. Operational performance of the entire canal system is then assessed based on the customized operational assessment indicators for developing the framework. Finally, the last part of the framework includes performance evaluation of the approach introduced in the present study with respect to sustainable development goals, using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. For this purpose, the effect of any changes in the calculated volume of water, through employing the framework, on the economic, social, and environmental indicators can be observed. This framework is expected to provide a guideline for the water authorities in ranking the inter-sectoral impacts of economic, social, and environmental effects of the operational scenarios. The developed framework provides a mechanism in which managers and planners of irrigation districts can test and assess their policies in different schemes before implementation. Also, the framework will produce the economic results of possible actions of farmers involving different managerial, climatic, and agricultural scenarios. The developed framework is then tested on the Roodasht Irrigation District, located in the semi-arid region in Iran. The simulation results are then examined.

N2  - This paper describes an investigation of various adaptations of rice
based cropping systems to climate variability in India's Telangana
State. All adaptations were generated through participatory engagement
and were field-tested with local smallholder households before being
evaluated through cropping system simulation analysis. This approach
contrasts with most research about adaptation of cropping systems to
climate variability and climate change that is mostly based on
simplifying assumptions about current farmer management practices and
where the feasibility of implementing proposed adaptations is rarely
tested. In this study, the investigation commenced with discussions
about climate related issues in rice based farming systems between
researchers, farmers and NGOs in three villages in three Mandals of the
state of Telangana. Participatory intervention was used to identify new
practices that could provide more adaptive and robust responses to
climate variability. Suggested adaptations were implemented in on-farm
experimentation. Fields demonstrating these adaptations were monitored
and results were discussed with participating farmers at regular
`Climate Club' village meetings. Crop and soil data from these fields
were used to locally parameterise the cropping systems simulator APSIM.
Local adaptations that were trialled in the villages were simulated
using local soil and long term historical weather data. In each of the
case studies, a number of adaptations that were developed and
implemented in the villages were shown through simulation to be
successful in terms of agricultural production, stability of yields and
resource use efficiency. Of the adaptations investigated, sowing rules
to reduce the chance of crop failure due to early dry spells were most
readily adopted and are also relatively easy to extend to other
villages. Strategic irrigation of rainfed crops such as maize and cotton
resulted in significant gains to profitability and stability of these
crops but cannot be considered in isolation where access to water is
limited. Reduced irrigation of rice resulted in over 60 mm/ha/yr.
savings in water and some improvements in gross margins but this
adaptation was not popular with farmers due to its burden on labour and
added risks associated with unreliable supply of electricity for pumping
at critical times. The reduced rice area for strategic irrigation of
rainfed crops adaptation resulted in improved gross margins per hectare
per year and higher net water productivity. This adaptation is most
promising but will require institutional change around water use policy
and more equitable allocation of limited water resources within
villages. These results led us to the proposition that participatory
action research with smallholder farmers, coupled with field-testing and
simulation analysis can produce practical and productive adaptations to
climate variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Climate change is affecting water quantity and quality, with severe impacts on agricultural production. The use of nature-based solutions to address these challenges is increasing. Natural water retention ponds have been identified as viable solutions for water management in agriculture. This paper aims to characterize water retention ponds, and to quantify their effectiveness, direct and indirect benefits, and costs. The paper analyses the case of the Lamone river catchment in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), characterized by large seasonal variability of water flow and availability. This is an important agricultural area that relies heavily on irrigation. Here water retention ponds are systematically applied to store water in winter, for use during the dry season. They can play a strategic role in ensuring irrigation water availability, while preserving minimum environmental flow. The paper analyses both the benefits of ponds for the water balance at sub-catchment scale, and the environmental effects produced by ponds having an ecological functionality. We develop an implementation scenario for new ponds, and we appraise the contribution of new ponds whose siting is chosen in order to maximize landscape connectivity. Their hydrological effects are evaluated under present and future climate change scenarios, showing how they may increase water availability for irrigation, while improving the river flow regime. More water for irrigation can favour additional agricultural production, while a more ecologically oriented design of ponds can favour to landscape ecological improvements. The investment costs of ponds are justified in economic terms, and the additional costs of improved design are expected to be balanced by the ecosystem services obtained. The business model required to operate this type of intervention is discussed, together with potential funding channels. We discuss two innovative incentive models based on compensation of land and production lost, and on tradable development rights that can be applied to widely support NBS implementation.

N2  - Analysis of the possible economic impact of climate change at the local
level is becoming increasingly relevant to agricultural policy, in terms
of the definition of new measures to sustain adaptation of the farm
sector. This study focuses on a Mediterranean agricultural zone to
evaluate the economic impact of rainfall regime changes that modify the
accumulation of irrigation water in a dam. The objective is to identify
farm typologies that suffer more from rainfall changes, in order to
target policy measures that increase farm sector capability to adapt to
climate change. First, an analysis of historical series is conducted for
precipitation. The decreasing trend in annual precipitation, as well as
an increase in monthly rainfall variability, is shown to have a
statistically significant influence on the regime of water accumulation
in the dam. Density functions representing this regime are estimated for
several periods, including the 1960s-1970s, the current time and a time
interval that extends to 2015. A comparison of these functions reveals
an increase in variability of water accumulation in the dam through
time. Parameters of these functions are used in three models of Discrete
Stochastic Programming to represent different expectations of irrigation
water availability and to simulate the possible reaction of the farm
sector in the study area to the different scenarios. The simulation
results show that both income and employment are noticeably reduced in
some farm typologies when scenarios with higher variability levels for
water accumulation in the dam are considered. In addition, changes in
the use of soil are seen, the use of inputs declines and the quantity of
extracted groundwater increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Price-based interventions can be corrective where users extract from a common resource, but may also impact existing social norms, often crowding them out. In contrast, I find a pumping fee implemented by a group of irrigators in Southern Colorado effectively crowds-in pro-conservation norms, enhancing the financial incentive's impact. Using a unique, spatially oriented panel-data set of groundwater wells, I separate the direct role of increased pumping costs from the indirect effect transmitted through altered conservation norms. To quantify conservation behavior, I estimate how pumping at one well responds to pumping at nearby wells – using instrumental variables to address simultaneity bias – and interact that behavior with a difference-in-difference framework to assess the influence of the intervention. In the preferred specification, the fee directly accounts for approximately 74% of the reduced pumping and the remaining 26% comes from crowding-in conservation norms.

N2  - A quantitative microbial contamination model of Escherichia coli during primary production of baby spinach was developed. The model included only systematic contamination routes (e.g. soil and irrigation water) and it was used to evaluate the potential impact of weather conditions, agricultural practices as well as bacterial fitness in soil on the E. coli levels present in the crop at harvest. The model can be used to estimate E. coli contamination of baby spinach via irrigation water, via soil splashing due to irrigation water or rain events, and also including the inactivation of E. coli on plants due to solar radiation during a variable time of culturing before harvest. Seasonality, solar radiation and rainfall were predicted to have an important impact on the E. coli contamination. Winter conditions increased E. coli prevalence and levels when compared to spring conditions. As regards agricultural practices, both water quality and irrigation system slightly influenced E. coli levels on baby spinach. The good microbiological quality of the irrigation water (average E. coli counts in positive water samples below 1 log/100mL) could have influenced the differences observed among the tested agricultural practices (water treatment and irrigation system). This quantitative microbial contamination model represents a preliminary framework that assesses the potential impact of different factors and intervention strategies affecting E. coli concentrations at field level. Taking into account that E. coli strains may serve as a surrogate organism for enteric bacterial pathogens, obtained results on E. coli levels on baby spinach may be indicative of the potential behaviour of these pathogens under defined conditions.

N2  - Considering the essence of economic orientation in agricultural water
management, this study proposes a practical framework for i) determining
agricultural water price scenarios, ii) addressing the economic, social,
and environmental effects resulting from imposing the scenarios, and
iii) operating systems performance appraisal for implementing the
scenarios. Accordingly, the framework constitutes interrelated
components of economic, hydraulic/operational, and multicriteria
decision-making models. The first component of the framework is the
Positive Mathematical Programming, which intends to determine water
price scenarios and assess the scenarios' inter-sectoral economic,
social, and environmental impacts. The hydraulic/Operational Model, the
second component, is coupled with the economic model to investigate how
successful the water distribution systems' economic policy in the status
quo. The third component is an operational model that provides a
real-time and automatic water distribution configuration, using a
centralized Model Predictive Controller. The automatic system deals with
the adoption of dynamic water prices as a free-market-oriented economic
policy. The last component, the multicriteria decision-making model,
provides the possibility of water price scenarios ranking based on
sustainability. The proposed framework was implemented in a real test
case, Rudasht Irrigation district, located in Iran's arid region. The
results indicate that the ``economic value of water{''} got the first
rank based on the sustainable water management criteria between the
possible price scenarios. The results indicate that the status quo's
water distribution system showed unreliable water distribution
performance under the entire water price scenarios, based on the water
distribution adequacy and equity indicators. However, reliable and
fairly water distribution between the stakeholders, located upstream to
the district's downstream regions, is provided by the automatic control
system in the water price scenarios. The results indicate that employing
the robust operating system led to -59% of water overused and -15% of
the energy consumption, as the environmental benefits, in the best
pricing scenario.

N2  - Ensuring water, energy, and food security with minimum damage to groundwater resources is a key challenge to achieve sustainable development in arid areas. To address this scientific and policy challenge, a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-nonlinear programming approach is developed for informing debates over improved management of the groundwater, energy, and food nexus that optimally allocates resources to food production to improve economic benefit and control groundwater depletion. Furthermore, this approach is capable of evaluating management policies affecting resource planning at a regional level. The approach is applied to the Neishaboor basin in northeast Iran. The main results are: (i) economic profit and food production depend on groundwater availability and energy use, which raise environmental protection challenges; (ii) the solutions could be used to define optimal policy strategies for sustainable management of groundwater, energy, food, and simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals; (iii) improved irrigation efficiency would be considered as an efficient strategy under conditions of growing water scarcity. The results of this research can inform policy makers on effective strategies for integrated groundwater, energy, and food planning.

N2  - Impact loads due to ship collision on irrigation structures is significantly decreasing their durability. Loss of material and degradation are quite common problems facing lock walls and piers. In the current research, rubberized self-compacting concrete (SCC) was used to investigate problems associated with impact. SCC with cement kiln dust cement replacement was used for that purpose. Concrete specimens were prepared with different crumb rubber ratios of 10% (RSCC-10), 20% (RSCC-20), 30% (RSCC-30), and 40% (RSCC-40) sand replacement by volume. Standard compressive, flexure, and splitting strength tests were conducted to monitor the effect of the added rubber on concrete behavior. Moreover, impact testing program was applied to specific specimens, cylinder of diameter 200mm and thickness 50mm, according to ACI committee 544 procedures. The number of blows to first and ultimate cracks was determined. The relationship between the mechanical properties and impact resilience is also presented. With the increase in rubber percentage the resistance to impact increased, but there was a decrease in specimen strength and modulus of elasticity. The variation in results was discussed and mix RSCC-30 exhibited the best impact resistance, 3 times over control mix with 40% reduction of compressive strength.

N2  - This study was conducted to determine the possibility of a crop water stress index (CWSI) to schedule irrigation for broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) grown with drip irrigation during the spring and autumn cultivation periods of 2007. The effects of five irrigation levels which were applied based on a ratio of Class A pan evaporation (kcp=0, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25) with 7 days interval on broccoli yields and resulting CWSl were investigated. The highest yield and water use was obtained in the treatment of applied 50% of the evaporation measured in Class A pan for two seasons, while the effects of irrigation programs on yield was not statistically significant. The seasonal evapotranspiration in the treatments varied from 187 to 326mm during the spring period and from 242 to 346mm during the autumn period. The CWSI was calculated using the empirical approach from measurements of infrared canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values for five irrigation levels. An average threshold CWSI value of about 0.51 before irrigation produced the maximum yield. The yield was directly correlated with mean CWSI values and the linear equation “Y=−36.51(CWSI)2+32.958(CWSI)+0.772” with a determination coefficient R2=0.99 and standard deviation Syx=1.38Mgha−1 can be used for yield prediction. The soil water content, soil matric potential, above ground biomass and leaf area index values were also found to correlate better with CWSI as a key function for modeling the crop growth model. The CWSI value was useful for evaluating crop water stress in broccoli and should be useful for timing irrigation and predicting yield.

N2  - This paper describes calibration methods for models of agricultural production and water use in which economic variables can directly interact with hydrologic network models or other biophysical system models. We also describe and demonstrate the use of systematic calibration checks at different stages for efficient debugging of models. The central model is the California Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model of California irrigated agriculture. We outline the six step calibration procedure and demonstrate the model with an empirical policy analysis. Two new techniques are included compared with most previous PMP-based models: exponential PMP cost functions and Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) regional production functions. We then demonstrate the use of this type of disaggregated production model for policy analysis by evaluating potential water transfers under drought conditions. The analysis links regional production functions with a water supply network. The results show that a more flexible water market allocation can reduce revenue losses from drought up to 30%. These results highlight the potential of self-calibrated models in policy analysis. While the empirical application is for a California agricultural and environmental water system, the approach is general and applicable to many other situations and locations.

N2  - We employ binary logit and Poisson estimators to model socioeconomic, institutional and environmental factors influencing the adoption of certified seeds, in particular, and integrated crop management practices, in general, in rice production in the Philippines. Estimates of factors influencing adoption are reasonably consistent between the two models but some differences are noted, particularly with respect to soil deficiencies and risk aversion. Results were found to be consistent between models in terms of the positive impacts on the adoption of certified seed technology and integrated crop management practices of farmers’ education, machinery ownership, irrigation water supply, capacity-enhancement activities and profit-oriented behavior. Conversely, soil and nutrient deficiencies are impediments to their adoption. Extension-related variables have the biggest impact on technology adoption. Results of this study provide information that is important in domestic policy making. Avenues for policy implementation to be analyzed for their contribution to net social benefits include the delivery of more capacity-enhancement activities, mechanization options and affordable credit to farmers as well as the provision of irrigation facilities and improved water technologies. Moreover, the government should consider short-term strategies that offset environmental adversities such as drought and submergence. Lastly, government interventions to improve the educational status of farming households, overcome the effects of small farm size and encourage more profit-oriented behavior by farmers are necessary to enhance technology adoption in rice production in the long run.

N2  - Water, food, energy, climate change and land subsystems are closely intertwined, and play remarkable roles in regional resources management system. Quantification of connections, synergies, and tradeoffs across these subsystems is needed in a more integrated and comprehensive manner, which is challenging due to the complexities and uncertainties involved therein. This paper proposed an inexact optimization approach from a novel water-food-energy-climate change-land (WORLD) nexus perspective, which has potential to promote social-economic development, guarantee livelihood security, and achieve low-carbon target. The approach is capable of (1) helping decision makers identify optimal policy alternatives among water, land, and energy, balancing economic benefit, water supply guarantee rate, hydroelectric generation, water-land utilization, crop yield, and greenhouse gas emission, via a multi-objective non-linear optimization model; (2) providing decision makers insights into in-depth analysis of optimal water-land resources allocation strategies associated with different levels of water supply, optimistic-pessimistic attitude, and climate change and where the effort could be made towards regional sustainability; (3) dealing with fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously occurring in objective functions and constraints as well as tracking fluctuating attitudes of decision-makers. The effectiveness of proposed model was verified in a real-world case in Zhanghe Irrigation District, Hubei Province, China. The changing range of economic benefit, crop yield, energy production, and environmental impacts were obtained based on optimal water-land resources allocation under different confidence levels and risk attitudes. Results under climate change scenarios show that climate change exacerbated local water shortage, especially in RCP 8.5, which requires 4.24 × 108 m3 of compensatory external water. Results also show that CO2 emission contributed 94.9% of GHGs emission, while fertilizers application contributed to 58% of total CO2 emission amount, calling for effective fertilizer utilization management. Compared with single objective models, proposed model performs better on providing coordinated policy solutions. The proposed approach can help manage resources in WORLD nexus system in a sustainable way, and is portable to other similar regions to promote sustainable development.

N2  - This paper focuses on policy interventions for improving irrigation water allocation decisions by including both macro and micro considerations in a unified analytical CGE framework. The approach is demonstrated, using the case of Morocco, by analyzing selected policy (top-down and bottom-up) interventions and external shocks that affect the water sector. Both direct and indirect effects of these interventions are identified. The top-down (macro-to-micro) links are of a trade reform type. The bottom-up (micro-to-macro) links pertain to changes in farm water assignments and the possibility of water trading. We find that water productivity is strongly influenced by these policies, with the general equilibrium (indirect) effects modifying and sometimes reversing the partial equilibrium (direct) effects. We also find that the impacts of the two reforms we assessed are different, with trade reform having an absolute impact of a higher magnitude than the water reform. Finally, we show that the sequence of introducing the policy reforms matters. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our model approach in the case of the Water Directive Framework and the Common Agricultural Policy, both applied in EU countries in an antagonistic manner. © 2005 Society for Policy Modelling.

N2  - Although several forage species such as perennial ryegrass are predominant, there is a wide range of forage species that could be grown in subtropical and temperate regions in Australia as dairy pastures. These species have differing seasonal patterns of growth, nutrient quality, and water-use efficiency, as demonstrated in a large experiment evaluating over 30 species at the University of Sydney (Camden, New South Wales, Australia). Some species can be grazed, whereas others require mechanical harvesting, which incurs a further cost. Previous comparisons of species that relied on yield of dry matter per unit of some input (typically land or water) did not simultaneously take into account the season in which forage is produced, or other factors related to the costs of production and delivery to the cows. To effectively compare the profitability of individual species, or combinations of species, requires the use of a whole-farm, multiperiod model. Linear programming was used to find the most profitable mix of forage species for an irrigated dairy farm in a warm temperate irrigation region of New South Wales, Australia. It was concluded that for a typical farmer facing the prevailing milk and purchased feed prices with average milk production per cow, the most profitable mix of species would include a large proportion of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii). The result was robust to changes in seasonal milk pricing and a move from year-round to a more seasonal calving pattern.

N2  - Water pricing and reducing the costs of the implementation and maintenance of irrigation systems have been a challenging topic for a long time. Water pricing issues combine two complex dimensions. The first dimension is the economy of the farm and its association with the broader economic system and farming practices. The second dimension is the hydrology and interconnection of the plot with the irrigation system, the river basin, and the underlying water policy framework. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate how the institutionalization of water applied would affect water productivity through the implementation of a water-pricing policy. To this end, this study formulated a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model with a gross margin maximizing objective function to assess the data collected from 213 farms in Hamadan-Bahar Plain, Iran. The results revealed that a water-pricing policy can change the cropping pattern and also irrigation system within the limitations of the case study. It can also be a driver to motivate farmers to use a modern and more efficient irrigation system. The potential environmental benefits from the improved on-farm irrigation efficiency depend on the government's ability to prevent the extension of the irrigated area. In absence of such controls, the aquifer depletion will be accelerated. Therefore, an appropriate water-pricing policy could improve water productivity and also reduce water applied.

N2  - The efficiency of an irrigation system greatly depend on the quality of water it is using. The suspended solids (amount and nature) found in irrigation water has a significant effect on irrigation water supply, especially on sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. In such irrigation systems, sediment in canal structures has both technical and economic implications in the development and utilization of water resources and hence, its control is very essential. Therefore, assessing the performance of irrigation structures and infield irrigation equipments is important for better management of an irrigation system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sediment trapping efficiency (TE) of the settling basin at Finchaa Sugar Estate under present sediment load. Suspended sediment samples were collected from inlet and outlet of settling basin using US D-74 suspended sediment sampler. The samples were analyzed in laboratory for sediment concentration and particle size distribution to assess the efficiency of the silt basin. The TE was determined for different flushing intervals (per week, per two week, per three week and per one month). The result indicated a TE of 30.15%, 13.9%, 4.47% and −1.05%, for the respective flushing intervals. The average TE for the test period was found to be 9.92%. In general, the performance of the settling basin is not bad under the existing sediment load. On the bases of the above TE result, this study recommended an optimum flushing interval of one week for the settling basin.

N2  - Weeds cause considerable yield losses in irrigated rice in West Africa, particularly where sub-optimal crop management or limited resources hamper production. Because of the recent focus of regional breeding programs in West Africa on a wide diversity of interspecific (O.sativaindica×O.glaberrima) and intraspecific (O.sativa×O.sativa) crosses for lowland systems, new genotypes with promising yield potential and putatively improved weed competitiveness are now available. Our study intended to establish a screening methodology for weed competitiveness in irrigated lowlands, to evaluate weed competitive abilities of diverse rice genotypes, and to relate several morphological plant characteristics with competitive abilities. A selection of 25 cultivars and advanced breeding lines was grown under irrigated conditions during the 2000 wet season (WS) and the 2001 dry season (DS) at Ndiaye (Senegal), and their reaction to four different competition levels was assessed. Competition was greatest where the test lines were grown with a mixture of an improved O. sativa indica cultivar and natural weed growth. Average yield losses across rice lines were 36% in the WS and 31% in the DS, but differences between lines were highly significant in both seasons and yield losses ranged from 0 to 84%. Competitive abilities were not related to yields without competition. In the DS, several of the new lines combined high yield with good competitiveness and outperformed the currently widely used check variety. Height, tiller density, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area index (LAI), and growth duration were mostly negatively related to yield loss. Plant characteristics measured in monoculture had no explanatory value for the competitive ability of tested lines, indicating that screening under conditions of competition with weeds is preferable. Competitive abilities of several lines were stable across sites, years, and seasons; in others, they were strongly influenced by season. The simplified experimental layout can be used to screen advanced breeding lines or established cultivars with moderate resources (e.g., space, seed, labour). Including such a screening in the breeding process would enable more weed competitive cultivars to be identified and would be likely to contribute to increased resource-use efficiency, reduced yield losses, lower costs, and less reliance on herbicides in rice-based lowland systems.

N2  - Global climatic conditions are expected to become more variable in the future, which will have far-reaching impacts on food production. In Asia, many of these impacts have been measured, but a comprehensive analysis of the effects of climate change on food production at the regional scale is limited. In this study, two key issues were addressed. First, we estimated the actual trends in temperature and precipitation across 12 Asian countries in Southern, South-Eastern, Western, and Eastern Asia between 1970 and 2018 and examined their implications on food production. Second, we deployed robust estimation techniques and examined how climatic conditions influence food production across Asian sub-regions. The results show that annual temperature across Asian regions trends positively. However, a cross-country analysis reveals varied trends in annual rainfall. The regional results indicate that temperature significantly induces food production in all regions except South-Eastern Asia, where the effect is negligible. Rainfall promotes food production in Southern, South-Eastern, and Western Asia but is not favourable to food production in Eastern Asia. The findings also show that the impacts of climatic variables on food production differ significantly from country to country. Our results are robust and suggest that substantial investments in agricultural extension, research programmes, and improved irrigation infrastructure are critical to enhancing food production and security in Asia.

N2  - Drought, as a natural and slow-onset phenomenon, creates numerous damages to agricultural communities. As a drought prone area in the Middle East, Iran has currently launched a crisis management approach to mitigate the harmful impacts of drought. However, thus far studies indicate that effective drought management strategies should be designed based upon vulnerability management which can increase farmers' ability to challenge the impacts. The purpose of this study was to assess drought vulnerability across three drought intensities (very high, extremely high, and critical) areas in Western Iran. Accordingly, a survey study was applied and 370 wheat farmers who all experienced drought during 2007–2009 were selected through a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. Face to face interviews were used to collect data on vulnerability indices from the farmers. Me-Bar and Valdez's vulnerability formula was applied to assess the vulnerability of wheat farmers during drought. Results revealed that the farmers' vulnerability is influenced mainly by economic, socio-cultural, psychological, technical, and infrastructural factors. The results also indicated that the farmers in Sarpole-Zahab township were most vulnerable compared to those in the Kermanshah township as the least vulnerable. Accordingly, some conclusions and recommendations are drawn for both policy-makers and practitioners who often must prioritize limited resources in the design vulnerability-reducing interventions.

N2  - Microbial inoculants are commercially-available products which have been promoted as biofertilizers, biopesticides, and phyto-stimulators. Research efforts have primarily focused on microbial inoculant performance on food crops and there has been limited information regarding their effectiveness on ornamental and bedding plants. We assessed the impact of two microbial inoculants: Companion® Biological Fungicide and Effective Microorganisms-1® on the growth of an annual bedding plant, Lantana camara L. under varying irrigation and fertilizer regimes and with or without presence of organic soil amendment. Both microbial inoculants appeared to positively boost growth index when compared to untreated plants in 2016. However, in 2017, both of these growth parameters were higher in untreated plants and in those treated with Companion® Biological Fungicide. We found that under low supplemental irrigation (2.54 cm water/per week) and low nutrition (1 lb 10N-10P2O5-10K2O per 9.29 m3 applied at transplant) and in a growing season with normal rainfall (approximately 30 cm), microbial inoculants could offer slightly improved growth and number of inflorescences in lantana. However, in the second year of the study, when there was above normal rainfall (over 60 cm June-October), plants receiving no microbial inoculant exhibited highest growth index and number of inflorescences. Our findings suggest that the use of microbial inoculants in a regular maintenance program should be evaluated after determining product and application costs as well as landscape environmental and cultural conditions.

N2  - This study developed a marginal abatement cost curve to identify a mix of least-cost investment options with the highest potential for hunger reduction, hunger here defined by the undernourishment concept of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Twenty-two different interventions are considered for reducing undernourishment relying on information drawn from best available evidence-based literature, including model- and large-scale intervention studies. Ending hunger by 2030 would require annual investments of about US$ 39 to 50 billion until 2030 to lift about 840 to 909 million people out of hunger, which is the 2020 estimate of hunger projection in 2030, also considering the effects of COVID-19. Investing in agricultural R&D, agricultural extension services, ICT - Agricultural information systems, small-scale irrigation expansion in Africa and female literacy improvement are low cost options that have a relatively large hunger-reduction potential. To achieve the goal of ending hunger by 2030, not only is it urgent not to lose any more time, but also to optimally phase investments. Investments that have more long-term impacts should be frontloaded in the decade in order to reap their benefits soon before 2030. A balanced approach is needed to reach the hungry soon – including those adversely affected by COVID-19 with social protection and nutrition programs. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Improving water use and nitrogen efficiencies is of overall importance
to society at large - to conserve scarce water resources and prevent
environmental pollution. Efficient cultivation practices for rice which
had no yield penalty were not adopted by farmers because of the open
access to water free of charge. Well-chosen combinations of policy
measures are thus needed to stimulate adoption of new cultivation
practices. We developed a multi-objective linear programming (MGLP)
model to explore the impact of: (i) modified rice cultivation including
water-saving irrigation on farm profit; (ii) water pricing and water
quota government policies on adoption of modified rice cultivation by
farmers; (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) to achieve the objectives
of both farmers and society at large, and (iv) to study the trade-offs
between income, water and nitrogen use. The analysis was carried out on
four rice-based farm types for the state of Tamil Nadu, South India.
Model results showed that observed farm profit of all four farm types
could be increased using current practices simply by optimizing land use
for specific crops. Adoption of modified rice cultivation further
increased farm profit. Water-saving practices were selected only when
water pricing was introduced. Farm profits were reduced even at low
water prices but were compensated by farmers through adoption of
modified rice cultivation. The combination of policies that stimulate
adoption of modified rice cultivation was effective in achieving both
increased farm income and water savings. The required water prices
differed across farm types and seasons and impacted poor
resource-endowed farmers the most. Providing water quotas could protect
the poor resource-endowed farmers. The model helped to identify the
optimal water price and water quota for each farm type to achieve both
the objectives of farmers and society at large. Opportunities for
reducing water use and avoiding environmental pollution at acceptable
profits are available for all farm types, but need to be tailored to the
farmers' resource endowments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

N2  - Tanks dot the rural landscape of south India covering the four states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh as a major source of water for irrigation, livestock drinking, domestic water supplies, fish production, and recreation. While many of them have undergone severe degradation during the past four decades, the efforts to revive them are also on for nearly two and a half decade through various programs. Yet, the recently launched Mission Kakatiya of the government of Telangana to revitalize the 47,000 plus tanks in the rural areas is praised by many as a unique one with potential to transform agriculture. There are no studies that show that the rehabilitation program as envisaged under Mission Kakatiya would help enhance the performance of tanks. Based on knowledge from past research, we show that there are hydrologic and socioeconomic constraints in improving the performance of tanks in Telangana in the current context. We then examine the validity of certain claims made about the impact of interventions carried out so far under the schemes and suggest some protocols for selecting tanks for rehabilitation in order to achieve the intended outcomes.

N2  - Urban water infrastructure expansion requires careful long-term planning to reduce the risk from climate change during periods of both economic boom and recession. As part of the adaptation management strategies, capacity expansion in concert with other management alternatives responding to the population dynamics, ecological conservation, and water management policies should be systematically examined to balance the water supply and demand temporally and spatially with different scales. To mitigate the climate change impact, this practical implementation often requires a multiobjective decision analysis that introduces economic efficiencies and carbon-footprint matrices simultaneously. The optimal expansion strategies for a typical water infrastructure system in South Florida demonstrate the essence of the new philosophy. Within our case study, the multiobjective modeling framework uniquely features an integrated evaluation of transboundary surface and groundwater resources and quantitatively assesses the interdependencies among drinking water supply, wastewater reuse, and irrigation water permit transfer as the management options expand throughout varying dimensions. With the aid of a multistage planning methodology over the partitioned time horizon, such a systems analysis has resulted in a full-scale screening and sequencing of multiple competing objectives across a suite of management strategies. These strategies that prioritize 20 options provide a possible expansion schedule over the next 20 years that improve water infrastructure resilience and at low life-cycle costs. The proposed method is transformative to other applications of similar water infrastructure systems elsewhere in the world.

N2  - Plant ash content is related to water use efficiency (WUE) (dry matter accumulation per unit of transpiration) and Δ13C in a range of C3 species. In breeding programs, the genetic×environment interaction is measured with multiple locations and multiple years of evaluation but the genetic×environment interaction of ash or Δ13C has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess how within year cultural variation and yearly environmental variation affect peach leaf ash and carbon discrimination as measures of water use efficiency using cultural practices evaluated over a 13 year period of time. ‘Loring’ peach (Prunus persica) on seedling ‘Halford’ rootstock were planted in 1983 in a 4.5m×6m spacing in square vegetation-free-areas (VFA) around each tree (0.36 and 13.0m2). Three irrigation treatments (none, drip irrigated during stage 3 of fruit development, and fertigation during stage 3 of fruit development) were imposed on each VFA. Leaf ash and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) were measured in leaf tissue collected prior to harvest. Analysis of variance indicated that there were no differences in VFA or irrigation for either ash or Δ13C, however there were yearly interactions. Δ13C was significantly related to the growing season pan evaporation but the slope was low indicating a minimal response while leaf ash was not significantly related. In contrast, leaf ash was significantly related to the growing season rainfall amount while Δ13C was unrelated. Both leaf ash and Δ13C were unrelated to the growing season water deficit. The coefficient of variation for leaf ash and Δ13C are 0.16 and 0.04, respectively, over a 13 year sampling period. These data suggest that breeding programs screening for increased water use efficiency using leaf ash or Δ13C can anticipate a minimal amount of within location variation and thus place more emphasis on environmental or between-location variation.

N2  - Salinity caused by NaCl is an abiotic stress inducing morphological and metabolic disorders. The impact of salinity (0, 65 and 130 mM NaCl) on morphological traits, elemental and volatiles composition of six rocket genotypes (G1-G6) was explored. A significant reduction of shoot biomass, plant height and leaf area as function of genotype and salinity level was observed. G5 was highly affected by NaCl: at 65 and 130 mM plants were 48.6% and 59.1% shortened compared with to control. The volatiles compositions was also analyzed. Glucosinolates increased under 65 mM, then decreased at 130 mM. In G1, glucosinolates start with 7.4 (control), raised to 21.50 (65 mM) and finally dropped to 4.34 (130 mM). This trend was observed also for erucin, the major rocket's isothiocyanate. Rockets could be irrigated with saline water improving the health promoting compounds production. The evaluation of different genotype seems to be of great interest for future breeding programs.

N2  - We assess the performance of rice integrated crop management (RICM) technology options among small-scale irrigated rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley (SRV). Mathematical programming techniques are used to develop farm models in order to identify optimal farm plans, determine yield and profit effects, and identify key constraints to the use of RICM. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the implications of the results for farmers in different resource endowment groups. Simulation results show significant increase in yield and farm income from improved crop and resource management for small-scale irrigated rice production. The optimal plan for farms in the high resource endowment group is to allocate all available land to the RICM technology basket. The resulting yield and net farm profits are 7400kgha−1 of paddy and 621US$ha−1, respectively, and these are significantly higher than yields and net profits from observed farmer practices. However, the optimal farm plan, output and net revenue are different for producers in the medium and low resource endowment groups. For these groups, the optimal plans are to adopt RICM components in combination with observed farmer practices. Yield and net farm revenue for the medium resource category are 6200kgha−1 and 507US$ha−1, respectively. For producers in the low resource group, the corresponding values are 5300kgha−1 and 383US$ha−1. The key constraints for farms in the high resource endowment category are land, credit and labor for harvest/post-harvest operations. The key constraints for producers in the medium resource endowment category are land and labor for harvest/post-harvest operations. For farmers in the low resource endowment category, labor for weeding and harvest/post-harvest operations are the main constraints. The importance of labor for weeding in this group is explained by the emphasis on manual weeding. We conclude that farms in all resource groups will realize yield and net revenue increases from the use of RICM technology options. However, the optimal farm plans, main constraints and associated increases in yield and net revenue are different for different resource levels.

N2  - In olive (Olea europaea L), deficit irrigation (DI) has proven to be an effective management strategy to improve water productivity (WP, yield per unit of water used), particularly under localized irrigation. However, despite the significant research efforts made to adapt irrigation programs to each particular cropping environment, little has been done to study the response of tree root systems to DI. The present paper analyzes the effect of water stress on olive root morphology and studies olive ideotypes best suited to DI. To do so, the results of a two-year field experiment using two irrigation treatments, a well-watered control irrigation (CI) and a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), are combined with simulations using a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) model. Results of the field experiment show that olive root systems forage for water resources when RDI is imposed, i.e. they try to maximize the soil area explored. However, simulations indicate that under DI, foraging might not be the best strategy. Instead, a root system that tends to concentrate new growth inside the wet bulb will increase daily net assimilation (An) by up to 16%. The present analysis shows that tree performance under DI could be optimized to trigger a new leap in WP.

N2  - This research aims to evaluate the perceptions of and preferences for irrigation multifunctionality based on an analysis of stakeholder’ attitudes in a large irrigation system in Northern Italy, the Muzza canal. As the first artificial canal built in Northern Italy, this canal articulates a network of open earth canals that distribute water for irrigation, especially maize. The Stakeholder analysis approach and Governance model approach are applied. The collected data highlights: (1) each key stakeholder points of view regarding multifunctionality and ecosystem services, (2) the nature of conflicting attitudes regarding who and how the Muzza system is managed, and (3) the ability or inability to promote agreements among conflicting water demands. The results show how public administration is concerned about how to manage ecosystem services provided by irrigation practices, while private services are focused on how to guarantee the coexistence of consumptive and non-consumptive water uses, highlighting the persistent conflict between farming production and environmental protection. The rural community and civil society call for a debate about the future of irrigation multifunctionality in the Muzza system and the role of irrigation practices in landscape provision and management. In addition, the paper examines if multifunctionality is a characteristic or an objective of irrigation systems. These results can be used by researchers and relevant authorities to customize their interventions based on previous, well-structured knowledge of various stakeholders’ priorities.

N2  - In sprinkler irrigation the water distribution uniformity in field
conditions is not always a known factor, mainly due to the many
variables involved, especially the wind. The main objective of this
study was to design, install and test an automatic sprinkler bench to
measure the irrigation uniformity of solid set systems for multiple wind
conditions in real time. The system developed measures the different
wind speeds and directions while simultaneously recording the rainfall
distribution automatically. Consequently, the system requires little
manual intervention, thus reducing the operating costs. All the
information generated is stored in a database, obtaining multiple
results of irrigation uniformity for each stable wind regime. As a
second step, uniformities in different situations (layouts and wind
directions) were studied. In addition, this study shows the potential
for assessing the influence of different variables on irrigation
uniformity for several sets of sprinklers. As an example of possible
applications, 12,150 results of uniformity coefficients for conventional
impact rotary head sprinklers with hexagonal nozzles in windy conditions
were generated. These data were used to establish comparisons between
different sprinklers. To do this, a multiple linear regression
methodology was applied in order to analyse the influence of the
different contour variables on the irrigation uniformity. The test bench
presented along with the methodology to simulate and generate multiple
scenarios constitutes a powerful tool for designers, farmers and
technicians both for the improvement of existing installations and for
future designs. The generation of a large amount of irrigation
uniformity results for sprinkler irrigation in different wind conditions
will lead to a large database with the potential to be able to determine
the irrigation uniformity in all common scenarios.

N2  - Unsuitable practices and improper land management lead to soil degradation and therefore deviates land from optimum productivity. Remote sensing indices and spatial variability of soil properties were implemented in Arc GIS model-Builder for quantitative assessment of land degradation in Siwa Oasis, western desert, Egypt. Semivariogram model through Kriging techniques was used to produce maps of soil properties in two dates 2002 and 2017. This was done in order to calculate soil degradation rates and its areas in the studied area. The results indicated that geostatistical approach and ArcGIS model-builder can directly reveal the spatial variability of soil properties and measure accurately the changes in soil properties. The results will help the farmers and decision makers for improving the soil-water management. The cross-validation results illustrated the smoothing effect of the spatial prediction. Physical and chemical properties of 90 soil profiles were analyzed and chemical parameters were analyzed of 30 groundwater sample, collected from irrigation-wells. Landsat images of five different periods were collected to monitor the changes of the surface features of soil salinity and water logging. Soil analyses show a wide variability. The very saline, non-sodic soils cover most of the suited soils. Agricultural areas, saline soils and water logged areas were increased. The increment of saline soil and water logged areas is associated with poor drainage and increment in crop irrigation. There is degradation in groundwater quality which indicated by its salinity. The studied soils are salt-affected and this prompts the need of a proper land reclamation program and prods the development of effective irrigation and drainage systems.

N2  - This paper sought to answer the question, how did Zimbabwe land reforms impact on water use, property rights and investment in water infrastructure? This was done for Biri dam in Middle Manyame subcatchment. Landuse and landcover changes from 1984 through the land reform period to 2019 were analysed through GIS and remote sensing techniques. Water allocation and dam levels records were analysed to understand water use patterns within the subcatchment in the aftermath of the land reforms. Interviews were used to investigate perceptions on property rights and investment in water infrastructure. The study found that construction of the Biri dam coincided with the commencement of the Fast-Track Land Reform Programme. As a part of the reform process, the custodianship of the Biri dam was moved to the national water authority. Consequently, farmers who had invested in the dam lost their investment. Changes in land ownership affected water use, so much that between 2007 and 2020 the dam mostly maintained water storage levels above 70%. The study attributed the 85% decrease in land put under irrigation from 1984 to 2019 to the land reforms. Municipal water use, rather than agriculture for which the dam was primarily constructed, has now become the largest water user in the subcatchment. The study concluded that land reforms impacted negatively on water utilization and loss of investment in water infrastructure. The study recommends that land and water changes be implemented concurrently, taking into account how changes in one resource affects the other.

N2  - We compared intra-varietal variation of two rice varieties (Ashoka 200F and Ashoka 900F) produced by a very simple bulk breeding method (mass selection with no line selection at any stage) with one line-selected variety (Ashoka 228), all derived from the same cross. Their parents, the upland variety Kalinga III and the irrigated transplanted medium-lowland variety IR64, both originated through line selection and were used as control varieties. Panicle-to-row progenies of all the varieties were evaluated in eastern India under irrigation in the dry season and in the rainy season using two water regimes; entirely rainfed or with supplementary irrigation. Intra-varietal variation for quantitative traits, irrespective of the method of breeding, was low. Only Ashoka 200F had significant variation for grain yield, days to flowering and plant height but only in the dry season. This season was not the target of the breeding programme and selection would be unlikely to produce a worthwhile response for the rainy season. At 43 SSR loci there was more genetic variation between lines within the bulk-selected varieties than within Ashoka 228. Kalinga III was the least variable variety while IR64 had less heterozygosity but greater heterogeneity than the two bulk-selected varieties. Despite the greater simplicity of the method, mass selection in bulk populations produced varieties that met the distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS) criteria for seed certification in India. Such uniformity was achieved because of the high selection pressures applied to the bulk. We conclude that this very simple bulk-population breeding approach is highly cost-effective and produces sufficient seed for wide testing earlier than any alternative method.

N2  - Soil salinization is a major problem affecting productivity of irrigated lands in arid and semi-arid areas. Managing salinity to minimize environmental impact is a prerequisite for sustainable irrigated agriculture. The objective of this study was to assess the level of salinity in Sego irrigated farm, Ethiopia and to map temporal and spatial distribution of salt affected soils to support management programmes. The study employed normal image classification, and developing models from ECe vs NDSI and thematic layers to map soil salinity, using geospatial tools. Multi-temporal Landsat TM images of 1984, 1995 and 2010 were used to detect salinity affected areas in the study area. Results of the study revealed that around 6ha of the area gets moderately to strongly salinized per year. Empirical model developed from ECe vs NDSI of 2010 image using regression analysis revealed the coefficient of relation as 66%. The model was extended for the whole area, and revealed that 2.0% of the study area was strongly saline and 54.7% of the area was non-saline. Overlay model developed from water table, land form, land management type and land-cover has revealed that 11.2% of the study area was non-saline, whereas 47.2% and 3.0% was moderately and strongly saline, respectively. Validation of the models was made to test their predication capability and the overlay model has revealed better correlation coefficient of 67.3% to the measured ECe. Most of the salt affected areas were on shallow water table. Cambisols and fluvisols were greatly affected by salinity. The results indicate that long-term irrigation activities would affect agricultural potentiality of the area in the future, and geospatial tools are efficient and feasible for detecting salt affected areas from satellite images and thematic maps.

N2  - China is working hard to reconcile growing demands for freshwater with already oversubscribed renewable water resources. However, the knowledge essential for setting and achieving the intended water consumption cuts remains limited. Here we show that on-farm water management interventions such as improved irrigation and soil management practices for maize cultivation can lead to substantial water consumption reductions, by a simulated total of 28–46 % (7–14 billion m3/year) nationally, with or without the impacts of climate change. The water consumption cut is equivalent to 16–31 % of the ultimate capacity of the South-North Water Transfer Project. Much of the reduction is achievable at the populous and water-stressed North China Plain and Northeast China. Meanwhile, the interventions can increase maize production by an estimated 7–15 %, meeting 22–28 % of demand increase projected for 2050. The water management and food production improvements obtained are crucial for achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to water, land, and food in China and far beyond. © 2019 The Authors

N2  - The crop developmental stage represents essential information for irrigation scheduling/fertilizer management, understanding seasonal ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, and evaluating crop productivity. In this study, we devised an approach called the Two-Step Filtering (TSF) for detecting the phenological stages of maize and soybean from time-series Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations. The TSF method consists of a Two-Step Filtering scheme that includes: (i) smoothing the temporal WDRVI data with a wavelet-based filter and (ii) deriving the optimum scaling parameters from shape-model fitting procedure. The date of key crop development stages are then estimated by using the optimum scaling parameters and an initial value of the specific phenological date on the shape model, which are preliminary defined in reference to ground-based crop growth stage observations. The shape model is a crop-specific WDRVI curve with typical seasonal features, which were defined by averaging smoothed, multi-year WDRVI profiles from MODIS 250-m data collected over irrigated maize and soybean study sites. In this study, the TSF method was applied to MODIS-derived WDRVI data over a 6-year period (2003 to 2008) for two irrigated sites and one rainfed site planted to either maize or soybean as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program (CSP) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A comparison of satellite-based retrievals with ground-based crop growth stage observations collected by the CSP over the six growing seasons for these three sites showed that the TSF method can accurately estimate the date of four key phenological stages of maize (V2.5: early vegetative stage, R1: silking stage, R5: dent stage and R6: maturity) and soybean (V1: early vegetative stage, R5: beginning seed, R6: full seed and R7: beginning maturity). The root mean square error (RMSE) of phenological-stage estimation for maize ranged from 2.9 [R1] to 7.0 [R5] days and from 3.2 [R6] to 6.9 [R7] days for soybean, respectively. In addition, the TSF method was also applied for two years (2001 and 2002) over eastern Nebraska to test its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of these key phenological stages over a larger geographic area. The MODIS-derived crop phenological stage dates agreed well with the statistical crop progress data reported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for eastern Nebraska's three crop agricultural statistic districts (ASDs). At the ASD-level, the RMSE of phenological-stage estimation ranged from 1.6 [R1] to 5.6 [R5] days for maize and from 2.5 [R7] to 5.3 [R5] days for soybean.

N2  - This study develops a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of new methods to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices. The methodology consists of a comparative cost-benefit analysis based on the Value of Information approach that makes it possible to analyse whether an improvement in the information available to farmers generates economic benefits. The method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models (providing irrigation advice based on measurements, water balance models and weather predictions) and prevailing irrigation practices (at times based on soil and plant observations, or on advanced technologies) in estimating and predicting crop water requirements, in pilot experiments located in four different European regions. The results reveal that the introduction of the alternative method improves the performance of irrigation practices in Mediterranean regions that are characterised by high weather variability and for those crops for which the consequences of failing to meet predictions are relatively low (i.e. tomato instead of maize, drip irrigated crops instead of sprinkler irrigated crops). Under favourable conditions, the use of the alternative technology generates a 0–20% increase in gross margin and a 10–30% water saving with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices. The study concludes by addressing the conditions that justify the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation interventions and by offering some policy recommendations to drive their uptake. These include subsidising research at the evaluation stage and public investments aimed at knowledge creation (weather and shallow water table monitoring stations) and knowledge sharing (counselling) at the adoption stage.

N2  - In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation based dual-interval stochastic programming (MC-DSP) method is developed for assessment of uncertainty effects on crop planning and irrigation water supply associated with multiple uncertainties expressed as dual intervals and probability distributions. MC-DSP can permit in-depth analyses of various policies that are associated with different levels of economic consequences (due to uncertain water inflow) when the pre-regulated irrigation targets are violated. The developed method is applied to crop planning and water allocation for the Zhangweinan River Basin in China. Solutions of crop planning and irrigation-water allocation under different probability distributions and plausibility degrees are generated. Results reveal that surface water availabilities associated with different probability distributions can lead to changed system benefits and irrigation shortages. Moreover, water is insufficient to satisfy the requirement for wheat due to its high requirement for irrigation, which may lead to the risk of food supply. Each subarea of farmland would suffer water deficit under all scenarios (particularly for subareas of Daming county and Neihuang county) when inflow level range from very-low to high. The conflicts between economic development and agricultural sustainability would be a challenged issue that would enforce the local authority to adjust the current food security policy.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture is adapting to viability challenges due to water contamination from mining in various ways. We explore the option of using crops that are able to tolerate the impacts of such water contamination as a short term adaptation strategy. We present a framework which enables the selection of crops suitable for irrigated production using mining contaminated water. The framework identifies key factors that should inform crop selection; and these include crop adaptation to climatic conditions, contaminants present in water, crop tolerance to contaminants, crop use and accumulation of toxic metals. A proposed process for screening and selecting a crop is described. Although considered a partial analysis due to incomplete and non-standardised information on crop tolerance levels, the framework narrows down choices which can be assessed in more detail or with field trials. The framework shows that interventions beyond the farm level are necessary to support the use of contaminant tolerant crops as a strategy for adapting to water contamination from mining. However, key questions regarding the risks associated with alternative crops and difficulties in selecting suitable crops remain.

N2  - The trade-off between poverty alleviation and cost effectiveness (profit maximization) encountered by NGOs is a global concern for the microfinance industry. To understand this trade-off at the micro level, we investigate the factors determining the program location choice of NGOs using village level survey data from Bangladesh. We document that NGO coverage in a village—measured by the percentage of NGO member households, number of NGOs working, and NGO density in the village—decreases with distance of the village from marketplaces and increases with the adoption of modern irrigation methods. The results suggest that cost effectiveness and loan repayment concerns serve as barriers to reaching the poor. They also suggest the inability of the microfinance program to mitigate credit market imperfections in the presence of output market imperfections, and this implication can be generalized for the microfinance industry worldwide. The results also shed light on the specific nature of the selection bias previously unknown and can be important for impact evaluation of the microfinance program. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The article describes a new modelling approach and module for soil
salinity management. The two major objectives of the module are to
simulate the seasonal course of the salinity of the soil solution in the
active root zone of drip-irrigated crops to assist irrigators to
optimise irrigation and salt leaching, and to help evaluate the salt
fluxes in the deep percolating water for assessing the longer-term salt
load of the irrigated crops on the regional ground and surface water
resources. The module is based on the solutions of the DIDAS program for
quasi-steady water flow and uptake for various drip irrigation
scenarios, and on differentiating the applied water to evaporation from
the soil surface, uptake by the plant roots, deep percolation through
the root zone that leaches salt out of it, and deep percolation outside
of the root zone that does not leach salts. After laying out the
rationale behind the suggested approach and outlining the expressions
used in the module for evaluating the salinity of the root zone, several
sample computations, in silico experiments, are performed to illustrate
the module functionality and its potential application, and to serve for
sensitivity analysis of the system parameters. Additional investigation
is needed into the adequacy of the suggested modelling approach and the
developed module to simulate soil salinity in the active root zone.

N2  - Precipitation of insoluble compounds poses a relevant concern in the management of drip irrigation. This risk is controlled by acidification of irrigation water. The main objective of this work was the development of a GIS-based tool to control drip clogging risk in drip irrigation by nitric acid injection in irrigation water. The study was performed in the province of Jaen (south Spain) focused on the irrigation of olive orchards. The GIS-based model was developed incorporating climate and water data in order to identify zones with different risks of drip clogging which require different rates of acid injection in the irrigation water. Volume of nitric acid injected increased with irrigation frequency and acid injection time. The model provided information on the total amount of N supplied with acidulated irrigation water; e.g. with 30min injection time in daily irrigations, more than 10kgNha−1 were applied in 47% of land potentially irrigated with surface water, meanwhile this percentage was around 60% of that potentially irrigated with underground water. This means that N supply with acid injections to reduce clogging risk may account for a relevant portion of N fertilization requirements in olive orchards. Consequently, this supply should be integrated in fertilization programs to avoid agronomic and environmental constraints. The GIS-based tool proposed was able to provide complementary technical solutions to the clogging problem in drip irrigation. For each alternative released, a precise estimation of N supply to be considered in accurate N fertilizer management was provided. The tool also supplied graphical visualization of information and functionality of handling geographic data with an easy update. All this is necessary in planning and decision making at regional scale with changing properties in irrigation water.

N2  - Livestock provides an important source of income and nourishment for around one billion rural households worldwide. Demand for livestock food products is increasing, especially in developing countries, and there are opportunities to increase production to meet local demand and increase farm incomes. Estimating the scale of livestock yield gaps and better understanding factors limiting current production will help to define the technological and investment needs in each livestock sector. The aim of this paper is to quantify livestock yield gaps and evaluate opportunities to increase dairy production in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, using case studies from Ethiopia and India. We combined three different methods in our approach. Benchmarking and a frontier analysis were used to estimate attainable milk yields based on survey data. Household modelling was then used to simulate the effects of various interventions on dairy production and income. We tested interventions based on improved livestock nutrition and genetics in the extensive lowland grazing zone and highland mixed crop-livestock zones of Ethiopia, and the intensive irrigated and rainfed zones of India. Our analyses indicate that there are considerable yield gaps for dairy production in both countries, and opportunities to increase production using the interventions tested. In some cases, combined interventions could increase production past currently attainable livestock yields.

N2  - Reservoirs are increasingly deemed to be important given their potential control of water availability across seasons, from wet to dry seasons, especially given the concerns on the effect of climate change. In this paper, we assess the potential scope for policy intervention on the construction of irrigation reservoirs and its design, focusing on the collective action aspect. We formulate a theoretical model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir. We conceptualized the reservoir as a “blue club” that increases the potential water availability in dry season, thus improving water safety for the whole society. We determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the policy measures to correct it, focusing on two different club access rules (open vs closed membership). Results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership, and minimum participation rules are required to increase the club size.

N2  - Food insecurity is still a major global concern. Population growth, poverty, climate variability, and low agricultural productivity, among others, are threatening food provision. Rural areas in West Africa are particularly vulnerable due to low financial and physical capacity and high dependency on agriculture. Programs to support food provision exist, but their effects bear uncertainties under different weather and land use scenarios. Our study focuses on the regional assessment of food provision in the Upper East Region in northern Ghana under land use changes and different weather scenarios by using a Bayesian Belief Network. Especially in the beginning of the rainy season, there is a high risk of food insecurity. Therefore, seasonality needs to be considered in a modeling approach. In addition, we estimated the vitamin A supply indicating the risk of malnutrition. Improving agricultural programs, increasing income by off-farm activities, reducing post-harvest loss, reducing soil erosion, expanding irrigated areas in the dry season and increasing market demand were assessed in order to support food security. The Bayesian Belief Network specifically handles uncertainty and different data types and allows the visualization of complex socio-ecological interactions to communicate to different expert groups, mainly scientists and field officers. A combination of literature, calculations and expert knowledge was required to fill the knowledge gaps in the West African context. About 95 experts were involved in the Bayesian Belief Network development process. An important finding was that an increase in household income, for example by off-farm income, might be better support for people than agricultural programs for providing a contribution to food security under weather uncertainty, provided that income is partly spent on fertilizer. The same is true under increasing population and decreasing total cropland. The likelihood of food provision in the following rainy season was 15% to 55% lower than in the dry season. In addition, the vitamin A provision was far below the demand in all scenarios.

N2  - Most forested areas in South East Asia are located in mountainous areas, where they are reservoirs of biodiversity and have important watershed regulating functions. However, the continuing provision of these environmental services may be jeopardized by land use changes. To re-establish natural or productive forests, programs are being proposed in which participating farmers can set aside some of their cultivated sloping land and receive payment for maintaining the newly forested land. This paper compares two types of payments for ecosystems services (or PES)-type programs designed to favor reforestation by farming households: “Payments for forests” (PFF) and “Terraces for forests” (TFF). Both programs involve setting aside sloping land for reforestation but differ in the type and amount of compensation offered. PFF offers annual payments per area of retired land. TFF offers to cover the cost of converting a certain amount of a farm's sloping land into terraces, combined with annual payments per unit area of retired land. The main objective of the paper is to compare the two types of programs in terms of cost-efficiency – can we get the same amount of forest at lower cost? – and equity – will the poorest farmers participate? Using mathematical programming, we developed a set of farm models corresponding to typical farms in a mountainous district in Northern Vietnam. We simulated participation rates of different types of farms in the two types of PES programs. For each PES, we assessed the amount of land converted into forest, the cost of the program, and its impacts on land use and household revenues, at individual farm and village level. Results of our simulations showed that increasing access to irrigated terraces as a way of compensating for converting land to forest increased the participation of the poorest farmers and was more cost efficient than pure cash payments. This suggests that existing PFF programs are biased against the smallest landholders in the region whereas they could be transformed into win–win programs likely to increase forested areas and reduce inequalities among farm households. Our paper demonstrates that PES schemes, when fine-tuned to the South East Asian context, could not only be used to restore ecosystem services, but also to alleviate poverty.

N2  - Agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time. To improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production, this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting. This study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information, and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets, spatial water footprint, and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty. To test its feasibility, the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi-arid region in Northwest China. Three performance evaluation indicators, including synthetic degree (SD), sustainability index (SI), and approximation degree of ideal objective value (AD), are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies. Results show that (1) the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation, and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial; (2) the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation, which can improve economic benefit, increase utilization rate of green water, and fairness of allocation; (3) through optimization, the average total, blue, and gray water footprint among IDs are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo (2014); (4) Water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy, society and environment, but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives. The proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency, which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity.

N2  - For the past five decades, Tanzanian has regarded agriculture as a lead sector to economic development. However, more than 70% of the agricultural production has been for subsistence due to weak economic and technological investments. This happens despite the establishment of numerous programs, plans and initiatives to limit the problem. Therefore, there is an increased need to assess some important aspects of agro-ecosystems such as climate, soil and crops as significant factors for determining yields potentials in Tanzania. This approach is particularly important in the fifth term of Tanzanian government (2015–2025) which devotes serious efforts to transform the country to a middle income economy by 2025, whereas, industrial sector will be the key engine to capture this objective. In doing so, crop and climate data were collected from the Ministry of Agriculture and Tanzania Meteorological Agency. Microsoft excel and Theme content were the major methods for data analyses. Although there has been a slight increase in land expansion for crop production, the results exhibit that the overall agricultural trend (tn/ha) has been fluctuating at a declining trend. This yield decline has been significantly caused by rainfall climate change and soil infertility. This scenario is evidenced by the fact that the maximum potential photosynthetic yields in the study area is around 3–5 Mg/ha while that of the developed countries is 160 Mg/ha (10−6 Mg/g). Therefore, stoichiometric of fertilizer, rain water harvest or/and artificial rainfall, exploitation of ground water for irrigation, proper mapping or review of soil characteristics based on agro-ecological zones, proper breeding of various crops, intensive investments of finance and technology in agriculture should be adopted to maximize yields in the country.

N2  - Multiple crop models are now being used in climate change impact studies. However, calibration of these models with local data is still important, but often this information is not available. This study determined the feasibility of using maize variety trial data for the evaluation of the CSM-CERES-Maize and EPIC models. The models were calibrated using observed grain yield from variety trials conducted in Blairsville, Calhoun, Griffin, Midville, Plains, and Tifton, Georgia, USA. The software program GenCALC was used to calibrate the yield component coefficients of CSM-CERES-Maize, while the coefficients for EPIC were manually adjusted. The criteria for evaluating the performance of the two crop models included the slope of linear regression, R2, d-stat, and RMSE. Following model calibration and evaluation, both models were used to simulate rainfed and irrigated grain yield during 1958 to 2012 for the same six locations that were used for model evaluation. The differences between the simulations of CSM-CERES-Maize and observations were no more than 3% for calibration and no more than 8% for evaluation. However, the differences between the simulations of EPIC and observations ranged from 2% to 23% for calibration and evaluation, which was larger than for the CSM-CERES-Maize model. This analysis showed that calibration of CSM-CERES-Maize was slightly superior than EPIC for some cultivars. Although this study only used observed grain yield for calibration and evaluation, the results showed that both calibrated models can provide fairly accurate simulations. Therefore, it can be concluded that limited data sets from maize variety trials can be used for model calibration when detailed data from growth analysis studies are not readily available.

N2  - Landraces represent an important part of the biodiversity well-adapted under limiting environmental conditions. We investigated the response of two Southern Italy tomato landraces, the well-known San Marzano (our commercial standard) and a local accession called “Ciettaicale”, to different levels of sodium chloride in water irrigation (from 0 up to 600 mM) for a short-time exposure (one week). The combination of the chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange analyses suggested that Ciettaicale maintained a higher efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and CO2 utilization at high salinity concentrations than San Marzano. Stomatal and non-stomatal limitations occurred in San Marzano according to the reduction of maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry and the increase of intercellular CO2 concentration. Higher Na+/K+ ratio and higher concentration of total soluble sugars contributed to non-stomatal limitations in San Marzano leaves. These effects were significantly less evident in Ciettaicale. We also observed changes in total antioxidant capacity and leaf pigment content that emphasized the occurrence of modifications in the photosynthetic apparatus according to salt gradient. The more efficient assimilates supply and an integrated root protection system provided by sugars and antioxidants can explain the significantly higher root/shoot ratio in Ciettaicale. Overall, our results suggest that a comprehensive assessment of salinity tolerance in a genotypes comparison could be also obtained evaluating plant response to high salinity levels at early vegetative stage. In addition, further studies will be carried out in order to evaluate the possibility of using Ciettaicale in tomato improvement programs.

N2  - In the discourse on land reform assessments, a significant lack of spatial and time-series data has been identified, especially with respect to Zimbabwe's “Fast-Track Land Reform Programme” (FTLRP). At the same time, interest persists among land use change scientists to evaluate causes of land use change and therefore to increase the explanatory power of remote sensing products. This study recognizes these demands and aims to provide input on both levels: Evaluating the potential of satellite remote sensing time-series to answer questions which evolved after intensive land redistribution efforts in Zimbabwe; and investigating how time-series analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be enhanced to provide information on land reform induced land use change. To achieve this, two time-series methods are applied to MODIS NDVI data: Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA) and Breakpoint Analysis for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST). In our first analysis, a link of agricultural productivity trends to different land tenure regimes shows that regional clustering of trends is more dominant than a relationship between tenure and trend with a slightly negative slope for all regimes. We demonstrate that clusters of strong negative and positive productivity trends are results of changing irrigation patterns. To locate emerging and fallow irrigation schemes in semi-arid Zimbabwe, a new multi-method approach is developed which allows to map changes from bimodal seasonal phenological patterns to unimodal and vice versa. With an enhanced breakpoint analysis through the combination of STA and BFAST, we are able to provide a technique that can be applied on large scale to map status and development of highly productive cropping systems, which are key for food production, national export and local employment. We therefore conclude that the combination of existing and accessible time-series analysis methods: is able to achieve both: overcoming demonstrated limitations of MODIS based trend analysis and enhancing knowledge of Zimbabwe's FTLRP.

N2  - A three-year (2017–2019) irrigation research trial was conducted to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass to a wide range of irrigation scenarios and assess the efficacy of Weathermatic Evapotranspiration-based (ET-based) smart controller for autonomous landscape irrigation management during dry seasons in inland southern California. The irrigation levels applied throughout the experiment ranged between 39% and 103% reference ET (ETo) and the irrigation frequency restrictions imposed were 3, 5 and 7 d/wk. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were continuously collected to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass [‘Tifgreen’ Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt‐Davy] to irrigation treatments. Plots were also visually assessed and scaled from 1 (dead plot) to 9 (ideal turfgrass) following the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP) standards. Turfgrass water response function (TWRF) was introduced as a statistical regression model to estimate hybrid bermudagrass quality response (NDVI values) to irrigation levels over time. In the years 2018 (p < 0.01) and 2019 (p < 0.001), the irrigation levels showed a significant effect on NDVI values. The irrigation frequency restrictions showed no significant impact on NDVI in any of the years. We observed a high correlation (r = 0.84) between visual rating (VR) and NDVI data. The TWRF shows a high accuracy (RMSE = 0.047, no units), and estimated NDVI values were highly correlated (r = 0.89) with measured NDVI values. A comparison between the California irrigation management information system (CIMIS) reference evapotranspiration (ETo) versus temperature-based ETo estimations by the controller revealed the smart controller on average over-irrigated by 12%, 2% and 3% throughout the experimental periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. A long term (34 years) analysis using CIMIS ETo data and TWRF model revealed 75% ETo as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern California semiarid climate for months with high irrigation demand (i.e., May to November). The results also showed that hybrid bermudagrass could withstand more severe deficit irrigation treatments for shorter periods depending on ETo demand.

N2  - Increasing water scarcity and rising fertilizer cost warrant their judicious use in the world agriculture. It implies that management interventions should synchronize crop needs with soil supplies of these resources in the root zone to reduce probability of water and nutrient stresses and yield loss. This study examines the applicability of SUBSTOR-Potato model in analyzing potato response to irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a semi-arid sub-tropical environment of Punjab. In order to evaluate the model, database was generated by establishing a field experiment on potato (cv. Kufri Badshah) planted in mid-October on a sandy loam soil. Combinations of three irrigation regimes viz., irrigation water (IW) to pan evaporation (Ep) ratios of 0.8, 1.4 and 2.0 and four N rates viz., 0, 135, 180 and 225kgha−1 were randomized in a split-plot design with three replications. Half dose of N for a given rate was applied at planting and the rest half with a common irrigation 4 weeks after planting. The crop was managed for pest control by adopting local recommendations and harvested in end-January. Irrigation and fertilizer N had significant effects on tuber fresh yield, water use and N uptake. Performance of the SUBSTOR-Potato model was reasonable as indicated by close agreement of simulated crop phenology, biomass, water use, tuber yield and N uptake with the measured data. The normalized root mean square of deviations (RMSD) between simulated and measured values for harvest-time dry biomass and fresh tuber yield was 7.3 and 12.6%, while normalized RSMD for seasonal water use (ET+drainage) and total (tuber+haulm)N uptake was 12.4 and 19%. Simulation of tuber yield for independent data (2008–2009) was as good as for calibration data (2010–2011) giving confidence in the model. Scenario analysis based on historical weather data showed that mean potential tuber yield was 50.8tha−1 for October 1 planting that reduced to 41.8 and 37.8tha−1 for later (October 16 and October 31) plantings. The analysis also demonstrated that yield and ET-based water productivity (WPET) were greater on a sandy loam than a loamy sand soil for comparable irrigation and N regime. Interaction effects of irrigation and N on yield and ET indicated that irrigation response was greater in the presence of N. Greater initial soil water status reduced irrigation and N needs than with lower initial soil water for comparable tuber yield. Initial soil mineral-N also affected N and irrigation regime to achieve a given yield.

N2  - Sustaining irrigated agricultural production systems in semi-arid and
and regions requires consideration of with saline and sodic soil
conditions. The spatial variability of these conditions makes soil
reclamation an ideal practice in which to apply site-specific management
(SSM). We discuss an application of SSM in which preliminary
measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) supplemented
by ECa-directed soil sampling, are used to construct a GIS map of
salinity zones on which site-specific amendment application can be
based. Our primary objective was to develop a field-implementable
methodology for site-specific soil amendment application. The focus of
the program was on cotton production, although the method should be
applicable to other crops. A second objective was to establish
experiments to test the effectiveness of this program. Evaluating the
effectiveness of a sprinkler application for the first irrigation was
incorporated as a part of this program in hopes of reducing variability
due to poor germination. This study consisted of two commercial fields
located in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Based on the
consideration that ECa is directly related to electrical conductivity
from soil saturation paste extract (ECe) for known saline-sodic
conditions, we developed a four-step method for site-specific salinity
management in commercial fields. The steps included the following: (1)
generation of an ECa map; (2) directed soil sampling for ECe; (3)
determination of the estimated amendment requirement as a function of
location in the field; and (4) integration of the individual amendment
requirements into a practical spatial pattern for amendment application.
Cotton yield monitors were utilized to indicate spatial yield variation
throughout the replicated plots instead of aggregated yield values.
Because of the high levels of variability in these commercial fields and
the time required for amendments to have a substantial effect, we can
provide only short-term results of these experiments. In both of the
experiments no significant differences existed between the irrigation
and amendment treatments (p > 0.05), but increased yield trends
supported the benefit of sprinkler application of the first irrigation.
A Scheffe test of the cotton yield monitor data indicated significant
yield differences between in-plot treatment zones. (c) 2004 Elsevier

N2  - Increasing heat-stress conditions, rising evaporative demand and shifting rainfall patterns may have multifaceted impacts on Cambodia's agricultural systems, including vegetable production. Concurrently, domestic vegetable supply is highly seasonal and inadequate to meet the domestic food demand, which consequently poses risks to food security locally, particularly in rural areas. This study assesses the impact of climate change on the yields and crop water productivity (CWP) of tomato, pak choi and yard-long bean cultivated year-round under different irrigated conditions (drip, furrow and net irrigation) in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The findings of this study show a similar annual precipitation decline (-23%) when comparing the 2017–2040 and 2070–2099 periods for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5), though with significant seasonal differences between the two climate scenarios. Increasing water and heat-stress conditions are expected to have adverse impacts on tomato plants compared to pak choi and yard-long bean, which have a much higher heat tolerance. Differing yield trends are expected depending on the transplanting/sowing date, irrigation method and RCP. In tomato, for example, a -55% yield loss is projected by the end-century (2070–2099) when transplanting in January, whereas a + 37% yield increase is expected between November and December over the same period. In addition, pak choi yield enhancements of up to +30% are projected if sowing in May under RCP 8.5 for both drip and net irrigation conditions. Similarly, higher yard-long bean yields are simulated under RCP 8.5 (+29%) compared to RCP 4.5 (+11%) for the average of all sowing dates (January to December) and irrigation methods (drip, furrow and net irrigation). In sum, the findings of this work are relevant for evidence-based decision-making and the development of projects, policies and programmes increasingly informed by simulation results from bundling climate-crop approaches to transform agriculture in response to climate change.

N2  - Common practices of farmers on disposal of pesticide waste after use were surveyed in five regions of the rural area of Pieria in northern Greece using a structured questionnaire administered via personal interviews. Concerning leftover spray solutions, most farmers reported that they normally re-spray the treated field area until the spraying tank is empty (54.9%) or they apply the leftover spray solutions to another crop listed on the product label (30.2%). A minority of the farmers (4.3%) mentioned that they often release the leftover spray solutions near or into irrigation canals and streams. As regards rinsates generated from washing the application equipment, most farmers reported that they release the rinsates over a non-cropped area (45.7%) or they drop the rinsates near or into irrigation canals and streams (40.7%). Moreover, a great proportion of the farmers stated that they dump the empty containers by the field (30.2%) or they throw them near or into irrigation canals and streams (33.3%). Burning the empty containers in open fire (17.9%) or throwing the empty containers in common waste places (11.1%) was also reported. Several farmers stated that they continue to use old pesticides for spraying (35.8%). Training programs which raise awareness of farmers of the potential hazards of pesticide use and particularly of the proper management of waste products, recycling programs and collection systems for unwanted agricultural chemicals to prevent inappropriate waste disposal, as well as improving packaging of pesticides to minimize waste production are essential for promoting safety during all phases of pesticide handling.

N2  - Accurate assessments of non-point source pollution and the associated evaluation of mitigation strategies depend on effective water quality monitoring programs. Intensive irrigation season water quality monitoring was conducted on three agricultural drains (6h to daily sampling) along with analysis of decade long records from two larger agricultural drains (biweekly to monthly sampling) in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Analyses revealed significant temporal variability in concentrations of nutrients, salts, and turbidity over short time-scales (<1 day), as well as significant differences in monthly and annual mean concentrations. Statistical techniques were used to evaluate the sampling intensity required to meet rigorous confidence and accuracy criteria, as well as to evaluate the efficacy of different sampling strategies (e.g. grab samples versus composite samples). The number of samples required to determine mean constituent concentrations within 20% of the mean at a 95% confidence level ranged from 2 to 39 samples per month (SPM) for total phosphorus, 1–16 SPM for total nitrogen, 5–25 SPM for turbidity, and 1–3 SPM for electrical conductivity. Using a daily composite sample (4 subsamples per composite) instead of discrete samples was shown to maintain the same accuracy and confidence standards, while reducing the required sample number by up to 50%. This study emphasizes the value of a statistical approach for evaluating water quality monitoring strategies, and provides a framework through which cost–benefit analysis can be implemented in the development of monitoring plans.

N2  - Irrigation delivers major benefits in food security and human development. Irrigation also leads to waterlogging and salinity which threaten the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and pose major socioeconomic and environmental risks. The issue can be addressed by limiting net recharge to groundwater such that the water and salt keep natural equilibria. Often the information on net recharge within catchments is unavailable, particularly at lower spatial scales such as the farm or paddock; this offers little guidance for on-farm land and water management decisions—basic decisions that ultimately impact regional net recharge and waterlogging and salinity dynamics. This paper develops a cross disciplinary framework based on the concept of net recharge for setting paddock scale targets and to link these to the regional targets and community's goals for sustainable irrigation management. A management model, cast in a dynamic programming format to integrate a detailed hydrological model with an economic model was applied to estimate the productivity, profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in a region of the Murray Darling Basin in Australia. SWAGMAN® Farm model was used to determine paddock scale net recharge. This interactive model enables an individual farmer to choose a profit optimizing crop mix while lowering net recharge; this in turn leads to a win-win outcome for all farmers. The net recharge metric can be used for the conversion of diffuse source groundwater recharge to a point source recharge at paddock scale, enabling the definition of private property rights to a common pool problem and assigning individual responsibilities for its management—a vexing issue and a new concept for the commons literature. Net recharge shows significant spatial and temporal variation which warrants a targeted/zonal approach to address the issue. Regional and targeted strategies and actions to address the issue are identified. Apart from its applied and action research orientation, the development of paddock scale net recharge metric is perhaps the most significant conceptual contribution of this research which can lead to shared management of groundwater aquifers.

N2  - Adoption of technology is indispensable for increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to credit is often identified as a constraint on the adoption of agricul- tural technology. Recently, microcredit has generated considerable enthusiasm and hope for ensuring sustainable financial inclusion of the poor. We conducted randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the impact of microcredit on the adoption of technology and productivity of rice cultivation in Tanzania. Collaboratively with BRAC, a globally-known microfinance institution, we offered microcredit specifically designed for agriculture to randomly selected farmers. We estimate the intention-to-treat effect (ITT) as well as the local average treatment effect (LATE) of microcredit, by using the treatment sta- tus as an instrumental variable (IV). Overall, we find no evidence that the BRAC program increases the use of chemical fertilizer. Also, credit use does not result in an increase in paddy yield, profit from rice cul- tivation, or household income. Our results from sub-sample analyses suggest that credit does not increase the fertilizer use by those who have better access to irrigation water as they have already applied the amount of fertilizer near to the recommended level. On the other hand, credit increases the fertilizer use by those who have limited access to irrigation water and have previously used little fertilizer. However, possibly due to the poor yield response to fertilizer, the increase in chemical fertilizer use does not result in higher yield for them. We also observed similar phenomenon for the comparison between trained and non-trained borrowers before the intervention. Our study suggests that improving credit access may not be enough to increase small-scale farmersâ€™ technology adoption, agricultural productivity, and welfare.

N2  - In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm-based methodology to quantify agricultural and water management practices from remote sensing (RS) data in a mixed-pixel environment. First, we formulated a linear mixture model for low spatial resolution RS data where we considered three agricultural land uses as dominant inside the pixel—rainfed, irrigated with two, and three croppings a year; the mixing parameters we considered were the sowing dates, area fractions of agricultural land uses in the pixel, and their corresponding water management practices. Then, we carried out numerical experiments to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In the process, the mixing parameters were parameterized by data assimilation using evapotranspiration and leaf area index as conditioning criteria. The soil–water–atmosphere–plant system model SWAP was used to simulate the dynamics of these two biophysical variables in the pixel. The results of our numerical experiments showed that it is possible to derive some sub-pixel information from low spatial resolution data e.g. the existing agricultural and water management practices in a region, which are relevant for regional agricultural monitoring programs.

N2  - Vegetation greening contributes to gross carbon sequestration by plants and thus plays a vital role in mitigation of global warming. Terrestrial vegetation has a significant greening trend in South Asia (SA); however, it remains elusive how this greening translates to gross primary production (GPP) (proxy of gross carbon uptake by plants at ecosystem scale) in SA. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP in correspondence to leaf area increase (based on leaf area index as proxy of greening) over SA using remote sensing driven data on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computation, during 2003–2017. We found a much weaker increase of GPP in SA as compared to the overall greening trend, primarily attributed to the disturbance in cropland activities of the region. Especially, greening was highly significant (p < 0.05) over the most irrigated and fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of SA, however GPP trend was non-significant (p > 0.05) over this region. Further, natural vegetation areas also showed low vegetation greening and GPP increase during the study period. The analysis of the potential drivers revealed that both climatic and anthropogenic stresses (intensive cropping, population pressure) had a negative impact on the regional GPP, especially in IGP. Our study indicated that the overwhelming greening of SA because of enhanced cropland activities, did not contribute much to GPP over the region. The restricted cropland canopy carbon uptake and low GPP increase in forests led to a lower than expected increase of gross carbon assimilation over SA in the context of climate changes and anthropogenic disturbances. Our study inferred that effective reforestation programs and conservation of natural vegetation areas are essential in SA for efficient vegetation carbon assimilation.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of agriculture
and water policy scenarios on the sustainability of selected irrigated
farming systems in Italy, in the context of the forthcoming
implementation of the directive EC 60/2000. Directive EC 60/2000 (Water
Framework Directive) is intended to represent the reference norm
regulating water use throughout Europe. Five main scenarios were
developed reflecting aspects of agricultural policy, markets and
technologies: Agenda 2000, world market, global sustainability,
provincial agriculture and local community. These were combined with two
water price levels, representing stylised scenarios for water policy.
The effects of the scenarios on irrigated systems were simulated using
multi-attribute linear programming models representing the reactions of
the farms to external variables defined by each scenario. The output of
the models consists of economic, social and environmental indicators
aimed at quantifying the impact of the scenarios on different aspects of
sustainability relevant for irrigated farming systems. Five Italian
irrigated farming systems were considered: cereal, rice, fruit,
vegetables and citrus. The results show the diversity of irrigated
systems and the different effects that water pricing policy may produce
depending on the agricultural policy, market and technological
scenarios. They also highlight a clear trade-off between socio-economic
sustainability and environmental (water, nitrogen, pesticide)
sustainability. Water pricing will have, in most cases, less impact than
agricultural markets and policy scenarios, though it appears to be an
effective instrument for water regulation in the least intensive
irrigated systems considered. This emphasises the need for a
differentiated application of the Water Framework Directive at the local
level as well as a more careful balance of water conservation,
agricultural policy and rural development objectives. (c) 2006 Elsevier

N2  - Microbiological investigations into the occurrence and fate of pathogens in wastewater were carried out in a multi-annual measurement programme, using samples from three artificial wetlands equipped with pre-treatment systems (multi-chamber septic tanks, lagoons) and predominantly treating domestic wastewater. In this study, the concentrations of indicator organisms and pathogenic or potentially pathogenic microorganisms were determined in the various components or stages of the systems. The evaluation of data from some 3.600 microbiological analyses and a comparison with older data from a plant which has already been operation for 18y made it possible for the first time ever to include operational factors in the assessment. Average removal of all major indicator organisms and pathogens is 1.5–2.5 log units for one-stage systems and increases to 3–5 log units for multi-stage systems. Significant differences between horizontal and vertical filters were not found. If no clogging problems arise during their operation, multi-stage systems can meet the requirements of the EU bathing water and irrigation water directives. Influent concentration, wastewater temperature, and hydraulic loading rate were found to be major factors of influence. The performance of constructed wetlands in removing microorganisms is clearly superior to that of conventional biological activated sludge systems.

N2  - Irrigation plays a significant role in achieving food and nutrition security in dry regions. However, detailed ex-ante appraisals of irrigation development investments are required to efficiently allocate resources and optimize returns on investment. Due to the inherent system complexity and uncertain consequences of irrigation development interventions coupled with limited data availability, deterministic cost-benefit analysis can be ineffective in guiding formal decision-making. Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE) helps to overcome the challenges of evaluating investments in such contexts. In this paper, we applied SIE to assess the viability of an irrigation dam construction project in northern Ethiopia. We used expert knowledge elicitation to generate a causal model of the planned intervention's impact pathway, including all identified benefits, costs and risks. Estimates of the input variables were collected from ten subject matter experts. We then applied the SIE tools: Monte Carlo simulation, Partial Least Squares regression, and Value of Information analysis to project prospective impacts of the project and identify critical knowledge gaps. Model results indicate that the proposed irrigation dam project is highly likely to increase the overall benefits and improve food and nutrition status of local farmers. However, the overall value of these benefits is unlikely to exceed the sum of the investment costs and negative externalities involved in the intervention. Simulation results suggest that the planned irrigation dam may improve income, as well as food and nutrition security, but would generate negative environmental effects and high investment costs. The Stochastic Impact Evaluation approach proved effective in this study and is likely to have potential for evaluating other agricultural development interventions that face system complexity, data scarcity and uncertainty.

N2  - Summary
Climate impact studies in hydrology have traditionally neglected the land–atmosphere feedback. Hydrological models are forced with output from climate models but neglecting this feedback may lead to an inaccurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET). Two-way coupling of a hydrological model and a climate model can overcome this problem by linking the two models through a shared land–atmosphere process description. In this study we analyse the hydrological model MIKE SHE using a two-layer energy-based ET model for use in a coupling with a regional climate model (RCM). The value of coupling to MIKE SHE is that it makes it possible to include lateral transport of surface water and groundwater not generally treated in RCM’s and to represent human interventions like groundwater pumping, irrigation schemes, etc. for adaptation studies. The hydrological model is applied to the FIFE site to investigate the effects of model resolution and parameter scales. The area of interest corresponds to a RCM grid cell. The hydrological model is parameterized with effective parameters assessed directly from field data at the site and literature. Using only these observed data and literature estimates to parameterise the model, it is able to reproduce the observed ET, sensible heat flux and to some extent surface soil moisture content; over a whole growing season. Hydrological simulations carried out over a range of spatial grids from 240m to 15km show that, for this case, the areal average ET appears to be insensitive to model resolution. The model is able to reproduce some of the spatial variability within the area, but not the exact pattern. By running the hydrological model at the highest resolution with uniform atmospheric input we examined the effect of using coarser resolution climate forcing, for example from a RCM. The areal mean ET and soil moisture (SM) temporal variations are reproduced quite well, but the spatial variability in the hydrological response is substantially underestimated; mainly because of the uniform precipitation. Our results are therefore encouraging for using this type of energy-based model in a coupling between a regional climate model and a distributed hydrological model. As the FIFE area is a relatively homogeneous site, additional tests are needed at heterogeneous sites to validate whether our findings are in general valid.

N2  - The 2007–2008 international food crisis triggered national food security policies of several countries worldwide, creating a problematic situation in the global food landscape and led to a drastic shift in the national food security policy (NFSP) approaches undertaken by affected countries. In this context, agricultural policies were reformulated to focus on achieving a certain degree of self-sufficiency while obtaining agricultural efficiency and sustainable agricultural development. This study empirically evaluated Malaysian rice self-sufficiency (RSS) approach, focusing on production efficiency closely related to maximizing production approach and minimizing environmental impact. We utilized non‑parametric bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA), input- and output specifications to estimate the relative technical efficiency scores of decision‑making units (DMUs) by constructing confidence intervals and correcting efficiency estimations. Our finding reveals that the Malaysian RSS policy approach demonstrates a better orientation toward output maximization than resource saving. However, the average annual change of the efficiency scores in both specifications was found to deteriorate during the analyzed period. Based on regional analysis, an improved RSS strategic approach could help the nation attain rice production maximization, minimize the environmental impacts, and obtain production efficiency mainly through modernizing the irrigation systems, efficient agrochemical inputs usage, adopting best agricultural practices, and implementing soil treatments programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Unreasonable utilization of water resources cause serious water shortage and associated pollution problems. Improving water use efficiency (WUE) is helpful for alleviating water scarcity and mitigating water pollution. However, due to the conflict between water saving and economic development as well as uncertain parameter information, it is challenging to improve WUE. To address these problems, a water-footprint-based interval fuzzy robust fractional programming (WF-IFRFP) model was developed through integrating water footprint (WF), interval parameter programming (IPP) and fuzzy robust optimization (FRP) into a fractional programming (FP) framework. The developed WF-IFRFP model improved upon traditional methods by being able to tackle interval numbers and fuzzy sets under different system-violation risks. The developed model was applied to a water management case in the northwest of Inner Mongolia, China. The results of WF assessment showed that the water consumption of crop growth increased, water, whereas that used for reducing total nitrogen concentration decreased from 2012 to 2016. Then, specific benefit- and risk-explicit plans for cropping pattern adjustments were generated. The results showed that the water supply-demand ratio from WF-IFRFP would be [5.1, 10.7] % higher than that in the benchmark year of 2016. To assess its performance and merits, the optimal results from the WF-IFRFP model were compared to four alternative models. These comparisons reveal that the WF-IFRFP model is beneficial for improving irrigation WUE.

N2  - Sugarcane is a high biomass crop grown mostly in rain-fed environments. Water is a key determinant of sugarcane productivity, and in most production regions, varying and sometimes severe water stress occurs. Understanding the extent of genetic variation in response to water stress may allow for better targeted breeding programs. In this study a set of field experiments evaluating 31 sugarcane clones under rain-fed and irrigated conditions was conducted in two sugarcane production areas in Yunnan province, South China. While the water treatments had a large impact on mean cane yield there were little or no genotype×water treatment interactions for cane yield or sugar content at harvest, or for dry biomass sampled about five months (early biomass) after the start of crop growth. The high genetic correlation between well-watered and water stress treatments is consistent with the hypothesis that clone performance under water stress is mostly associated with general vigour rather than traits acting specifically under water stress. From a practical breeding program perspective the results suggest that choice or management of water stress level in selection trials is not a critical consideration for sugarcane breeding programs, and that selection under reasonably well watered conditions will be effective for attaining satisfactory selection gains under at least moderate levels of water stress. Early biomass was positively correlated with yield at final harvest for all water treatments. Resolution of the physiological basis of the high genetic correlations between growth under well-watered and water limited conditions may assist in future breeding efforts.

N2  - The increasing dependency on groundwater, especially in irrigated regions, has highlighted the notable place of groundwater resources within the water-food-energy nexus (WFEN). This role is particularly relevant in the Haihe River basin of China, a globally representative area that is experiencing rapid aquifer depletion. The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fallow strategy may have the potential to limit withdrawal in this region. Based on information from multiple sources, this paper proposed six kinds of fallow schemes—under the same triple-cropping system consisting of winter wheat and summer maize (Zea mays L.) followed by fallow and summer maize in two years (WW–SM/F–SM) but with different irrigation schemes—as scenarios to conduct detailed simulation by a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, the water balance components of the shallow aquifer and soil profile (2 m) under different scenarios were analyzed to quantify the variations in hydrological processes caused by changes in cropping system and pumping intensity. Furthermore, through 17 indices that could quantitatively describe the changes related to the WFEN, the effects of seasonal fallow schemes on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation, grain yield reduction, and energy consumption savings were evaluated. Based on these evaluation outcomes, linear programming was used to optimize the fallow schemes at the subbasin scale. As a result, to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown as well as improving water and energy productivities, the minimum reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55% compared with the basic scenario, while the summer maize yield would remain basically stable. Under the optimized fallow scheme pattern, 66% of the well-irrigated cropland should adopt the WW–SM/F–SM system with two irrigation applications for winter wheat and a rain-fed scheme for summer maize; additionally, 24% of the well-irrigated cropland should adopt the WW–SM/F–SM system with one irrigation application for winter wheat and a rain-fed scheme for summer maize, and the recommended fallow schemes for the other 10% of well-irrigated cropland varied spatially. Compared to the basic scenario, the optimized fallow scheme pattern could decrease shallow groundwater exploitation by 36.5 × 108 m3 a−1 (i.e., to realize shallow groundwater equilibrium), reduce the diesel consumption of agricultural machines and electricity consumption of pumping wells by 32% and 90%, respectively, and save energy costs by approximately 873 yuan ha−1. These results could provide a quantitative reference for policy-making in this watershed and serve as a typical case for similar areas that wish to implement fallow strategies to achieve groundwater sustainability.

N2  - This study examines the effects of different irrigation regimes on water use and root yield of sugar beet, irrigated with a drip system under field conditions in the 2012–2013 seasons at Cukurcayir in the Kırsehir Centrum of the Central Anatolian region of Turkey. Experiments were carried out in split plots in randomized blocks with three replications. The application of irrigation water was based on cumulative class A pan evaporation within irrigation intervals. Study treatments consisted of one irrigation interval (7 days); the two sugar beet varieties (C1: Esperanza and C2: Calixta) and three different irrigation levels (I1, I2, and I3) adjusted according to the class A pan evaporation (Epan) using three different plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.5; Kcp2: 0.75; and Kcp3: 1.00). The lowest and the highest values of irrigation water and plant water consumption (Et) were observed in the I1 and I3 treatments in both years, respectively. In 2012, the lowest and the highest root yields were observed in the I3C1 (85.38tha−1) and I2C2 (75.10tha−1) treatments. In the second experimental year, the lowest and the highest root yields were achieved with the I3C1 (66.13tha−1) and I1C2 (47.57tha−1) treatments, respectively. The impact on the examined parameters of irrigation programs in the C2 treatment had not significant. On the other hand, in the C1 treatment of irrigation programs had a significant effect on sugar rate, sugar yield, and other parameters. If the economic yield and quality are desired, the I1C1 treatment can be suggested for sugar beet production under the similar soil and climatic conditions.

N2  - Reclaimed water programs treat wastewater to remove hazardous compounds, pathogens, and organic matter and provide reclaimed water for non-potable applications. Reusing water may significantly reduce demands on freshwater resources and provide sustainable water management strategies. Though production of reclaimed water is highly regulated, public acceptability has historically hindered the implementation of successful reclaimed water systems. The public generally opposes the use of reclaimed water due to the “yuck factor”, which is the instinctive disgust associated with the idea of recycling sewage and the fear that exposure to reclaimed water is unsafe. This paper reports the results of an extensive survey that was conducted to evaluate the potential acceptability of reclaimed water use. A total of 2800 respondents across the U.S. participated in the survey. Results demonstrate that a small percentage of the population is concerned about water shortages, the majority of the population practices some level of water conservation, and a substantial percentage of the population supports the use of reclaimed water. Climate, demographic variables, and financial incentives were tested for influence on attitudes and behaviors regarding water, including awareness, conservation, and support for water reuse. Sex, age, last monthly water bill, and location (as EPA region) showed no significant effect on the acceptance of water reuse, while ethnicity, education level, metro/non metro, and income showed significant effects. Drought conditions do not have a statistically significant effect on the number of reclaimed water supporters, but increase the number of respondents who are water concerned, the number of respondents who are the most active water conservers, and the number of respondents who limit their use of water for lawn and garden watering. Financial incentives influence the willingness of respondents to participate in water reuse programs, and a decrease in the monthly water bills increased the likelihood that respondents would participate in a reclaimed water program. Support for the use of reclaimed water for various applications ranked positively, on average, except for the application of water reuse for food crop irrigation and use of reclaimed water at respondents’ own residences. Results and conclusions of the survey can provide insight for implementing successful reclaimed water programs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - With the rapid growth of population and economy, shortage and mismatch of land and water resources have deepened the need for cropping pattern optimization. In the context of the sustainable development of agriculture, cropping pattern optimization should not only pursue economic benefits, but the consequent environmental effects also deserve equal attention. Meanwhile, climate change increases the complexity of balancing conflicts of economic-environmental system by cropping pattern optimization. Therefore, this paper builds a multi-objective programming model for Economic-Environmental Synergistic Optimization for Cropping Pattern under Climate Change (EESO-CP-CC) model, with the goals of economic benefit increment and environmental pollutants emission reduction. The EESO-CP-CC model couples a non-point source pollution input-output model, a one-dimensional water quality model and an economic benefit function into an integrated framework. Fuzzy method was used to solve the optimization model, and the stochastic uncertainty of water supply under climate change was quantified by the integration of Bayesian approach and interval linear regression. The model was applied to Jinxi Irrigation District (JXID) in Heilongjiang Province, northeast of China. Results show that by adjusting the acreage of rice, corn and soybean, the harmony degree of economy-society-environment system increased by 10.7% compared to the current situation, indicating that the model tends to achieve the best possible economic benefits while ensuring the environmental effects. Compared with actual cropping pattern, the pollutants emissions reduced by 24.7% and 3% from corn and soybean, respectively. However, this led to a decrease of economic benefit by 8% in exchange, showing the trade-off between environmental pollution reduction and economic benefits improvement. The output coefficients of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants were optimized, with the optimal output reducing by 20% compared to the standard. Cropping pattern and water resources allocation vary with different climate change conditions, however, the amplitude of variation is modest, indicating that the model can cope well with the changing environment. The developed model can help achieve synergistic development of economic benefits and environmental effects, and thus promote sustainable development of irrigation areas, and improve the coping capacity of agricultural water and land under climate change, by cropping pattern optimization and planning.

N2  - Wheat genotypes such as landraces, old cultivars, wheat species, intergeneric and interspecific wheat hybrids from the gene pools nowadays offer an alternative for new wheat products and breeding programs. The present study was carried out to evaluate the grain technological quality parameters in those kinds of wheat species and hybrids under rainfed and irrigated conditions. The results of the study showed that the neglected wheat species, Triticum petropavlovskyi having the highest sedimentation index (SI), swelling index of glutenin (SIG), macro sodium dodecyl sulfate (MSDS), and Zeleny sedimentation (ZSED) values (4.9 and 4.8; 4.7 and 4.4; 77.3 and 71.0 ml; 51.0 and 44.7 ml, respectively) in rainfed and irrigated conditions, and as well as the GlutoPeak aggregation energy (AGGEN), gluten rheological index (GRI), torque before maximum (AM) values under rainfed conditions (1589.2 cm2, 68.1 and 43.0 GPU, respectively) had remarkable high gluten strength. Among the species, Triticum ispahanicum had the highest MSDS, SI, AM, and GRI values in rainfed and irrigated conditions (48.3 and 39.3 ml; 3.0 and 2.6; 37.3 and 25.7 GPU; 56.5 and 37.7, respectively). Aegilotriticum, Triticum sphaerococcum, Triticum dicoccum had also strong gluten quality. Triticum aestivum cv. Köse 220/39 possessed better gluten quality than other old cultivars and a landrace. All those genotypes can be suggested for bread-making. On the other hand, Triticum compactum and Triticum monococcum with their weak gluten strength and soft endosperm texture could be used in soft biscuit wheat breeding programs.

N2  - This study investigates the ability of gene expression programming (GEP)
in modeling of the infiltrated water volume (Z) under furrow irrigation.
Field data were collected in the literature study for modeling Z
covering wide range of opportunity time. Five variables were used as
input parameters; inflow rate (Q(o)), furrow length (L), waterfront
advance time at the end of the furrow (T-L), infiltration opportunity
time (T-o) and cross-sectional area of the inflow (A(o)). The following
statistical parameters that coefficient of determination (R-2), overall
index of the model performance (OI), root mean square errors (RMSE) and
mean absolute errors (MAE) are used as comparing criteria for the
evaluation of the models' performances. The best value of the
statistical parameters which range in training, testing and validation
processes as the following (R-2 = 95-97%; OI = 94-97%; RMSE =
0.013-0.009 m(3) m(-1); and MAE = 0.011-0.007 m(3) m(-1)) implies that
the GEP model provides an excellent fit for the measured data. A
comparison is made between the estimates provided by the GEP and the
two-point method. The comparison results reveal that the GEP models are
superior to two-point method. Furthermore, the remarkable advantage of
GEP was that it resulted in an explicit equation for the estimation of
the Z under furrow irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

N2  - Ecological restoration can mitigate human disturbance to the natural environment and restore ecosystem functions. China's Grain-for-Green Programme (GFGP) has been widely adopted in the last 15years and exerted significant impact on land-use and ecosystem services. North-western Yunnan is one of the key areas of GFGP implementation in the upper Yangtze River. Promotion of ecosystem services in this region is of great importance to the ecological sustainability of Yangtze River watershed. In this study, remote sensing and modelling techniques are applied to analyse the impact of GFGP on ecosystem services. Results show that the transformation from non-irrigated farmland to forestland could potentially improve soil conservation by 24.89%. Soil conservation of restored forest was 78.17% of retained forest while net primary production (NPP) already reached 88.65%, which suggested different recovery rates of NPP and soil conservation. Increasing extent of GFGP implementation improved soil conservation but decreased NPP and water yield at sub-watershed scale, which revealed trade-offs between ecosystem services under ecological restoration. Future ecosystem management and GFGP policy-making should consider trade-offs of ecosystem services in order to achieve sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

N2  - This paper evaluates economic and environmental effects of two incentive-based water management policies to address climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture: water markets and irrigation subsidies. A Southern European case study assesses farmers' long and short-run adaptation responses under climate change and policy interventions with a discrete stochastic programming model. Results indicate that climate change will likely have negative impacts on irrigation activities and water-dependent ecosystems in Southern Europe. However, the severity of impacts depends on government policy settings and farmers' adaptation responses. The comparison between water market and irrigation subsidy policies shows the advantages of water markets over irrigation subsidies in terms of both private and social benefits. These findings could guide policymakers on the design of efficient water institutions and policies to address climate change in the irrigated agriculture of Southern Europe. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Water resources allocated to the agricultural sector in the Yellow River basin are being reduced due to severe water scarcity and increased demand by the non-agricultural sectors. In large-scale irrigation districts, the application of water-saving practices, e.g., improving the canal system, using water-saving irrigation technology and adjusting cropping patterns, is required for the sustainable agricultural development and the river basin environmental equilibrium. Adopting water-saving practices leads to lowering the groundwater table and to controlling salinity impacts related to excessive irrigation. However, assessing the effects of water-saving practices on the groundwater system requires further investigation. The Jiefangzha Irrigation Scheme of the Hetao Irrigation District is used as a case study for analyzing the temporal and spatial dynamics of the groundwater table. A lumped parameter groundwater balance model has been developed with this purpose and to assess impacts of various water-saving practices. The model was calibrated with monthly datasets relative to the non-frozen periods of 1997–1999 and validated with datasets from 2000 to 2002. Results indicate that canal seepage and deep percolation account for respectively 48% and 44% of the annual groundwater recharge. Groundwater discharge by direct evaporation and plant roots uptake represents 82% of the total annual groundwater discharge. After validation, the model was applied to assess the impacts of various canal and farm irrigation water-saving practices. It was observed that improvements in the canal system (e.g., canal lining, upgrading the hydraulic regulation and control structures, improving delivery schedules) might lower the groundwater table by 0.28–0.48m, depending upon the level of implementation of these measures. Higher declines of the groundwater table are predicted when water-saving technologies are applied at both the canal and the farm systems. That decline of the water table favours salinity control and reduces capillary rise, thus reducing the groundwater evaporation and uptake by plant roots; that reduction may attain 128mm. However, predictions may change depending on the way how water-saving measures are applied, which may be different of assumptions made; therefore, there is the need to perform a follow-up of the interventions in order to update predictions. Results indicate the need for appropriate research leading to improved irrigation management when the decline of the groundwater level will reduce groundwater contribution to vegetation growth.

N2  - Scholarship on water insecurity has carried over an important insight from studies of food insecurity: Insecurity often occurs in the midst of plenty, and water insecurity is therefore better characterized by inaccessibility than by scarcity. Access to clean, adequate, and reliable water is, however, more challenging to systematize than access to food. In this paper, I ask what we can learn from situations in which arrangements for water access are undergoing rapid change, and I make a case for the centrality of infrastructure – systems of water storage and transport – to water security. Equitable access to water often depends on technologies that protect, filter, and distribute water; it also depends on social arrangements that protect the least powerful from exclusion. I analyse two water infrastructure projects in Ethiopia, one a project to protect village water supplies and the other a large hydroelectric dam. The project to protect springs used by villagers for household water supply had the unintended effect of limiting access to those who could pay fees to a water committee. The dam harnessed water to produce electricity and supply irrigated plantations, but deprived downstream communities of water for farming. Water infrastructure can have far-reaching implications for water access, both for better and for worse. It is often instrumental in securing one group’s access to water at the cost of another’s.

N2  - Lippia alba (Mill.) NE Br. ex Britton & P. Wilson is an important medicinal herb widely distributed in Latin America. However, the success of this crop depends on several biotic and abiotic environmental factors, being water availability the most limiting one. Therefore, the present paper aimed to investigate the responses of one tetraploid (tet) and two diploids (dip1 and dip2) genotypes of L. alba to drought stress by using irrigation suspension under 0 (control) or 15 (stressful factor) days. The physiological parameters water content, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments contents, and the qualitative profile of volatile organic compounds were evaluated by uni- and multivariate statistical analyses. Drought stress negatively affected the physiological processes in all L. alba specimens equally, regardless of the genotype. It was observed that photosynthesis was impaired due to stomatal limitation, which was triggered by low water availability. In contrast, the qualitative profile of volatile organic compounds was strongly determined by genotype without drought stress influence. Furthermore, gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were the most sensitive parameters to evaluate drought stress in L. alba. More specifically stomatal conductance is recommended to be evaluated in L. alba breeding programs focused on drought stress tolerance, given that its high contribution to photosynthesis regulation.

N2  - States are increasingly striving to create participatory local organizations for joint management of common pool resources. What local conditions determine success of such state efforts? What effect do these efforts have? Drawing on controlled comparisons between three districts in Indonesia and an original survey of 92 water user groups, I demonstrate that local political contexts condition the effectiveness of participatory irrigation policies. When irrigation is politically salient, local politicians pressure bureaucrats to better engage with farmers. The data also show that training programs are not as effective at increasing water user organization activity as frequent contact between bureaucrats and farmers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N1  - New proposals in the automation and remote control of water management in agriculture: agromotic systems
N2  - Among all the existing methods to study crop water requirements, necessary for an efficient irrigation management, the most accurate is the one based on the use of weighing lysimeters. The best known lysimeters are those used for crops in bare soil, with similar dimensions to the plantation frame of the measured species. These lysimeters are buried in the ground, require civil works, have a high cost and are commonly used in experimental plots to determine crop coefficients. There are cheaper and smaller scale lysimeters used to monitor water balance in pots without civil works. Although crop coefficients obtained from these lysimeters are not comparable to those obtained from crops in the ground, they may be useful to accurately determine the plants water needs so they can be used as a reference to irrigate the rest of potted plants of the plot. The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate a software system to optimize irrigation using weighing lysimeters in a potted crop. The software was programmed in a compact embedded controller using the LabVIEW graphical programming language with the Real-Time module. This controller receives data from the lysimeters throughout a Modbus/RS-485 communication network, processes them and realizes the calculations to control the irrigation valves in real time. The system was tested in an experimental plot owned by the “Escuela Politécnica Superior de Orihuela” with Vitis Vinifera L. cv Bobal. The software allowed the acquisition and data logging as well as irrigation scheduling based on water balance obtained from weighing lysimeters i.e. based exclusively on actual crop water needs.

N2  - Wheat production in the south of Khuzestan, Iran is constrained by heat stress for late sowing dates. For optimization of yield, sowing at the appropriate time to fit the cultivar maturity length and growing season is critical. Crop models could be used to determine optimum sowing window for a locality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Wheat for its ability to simulate growth, development, grain yield of wheat in the tropical regions of Iran, and to study the impact of different sowing dates on wheat performance. The genetic coefficients of cultivar Chamran were calibrated for the CSM-CERES-Wheat model and crop model performance was evaluated with experimental data. Wheat cultivar Chamran was sown on different dates, ranging from 5 November to 9 January during 5years of field experiments that were conducted in the Khuzestan province, Iran, under full and deficit irrigation conditions. The model was run for 8 sowing dates starting on 25 October and repeated every 10days until 5 January using long-term historical weather data from the Ahvaz, Behbehan, Dezful and Izeh locations. The seasonal analysis program of DSSAT was used to determine the optimum sowing window for different locations as well. Evaluation with the experimental data showed that performance of the model was reasonable as indicated by fairly accurate simulation of crop phenology, biomass accumulation and grain yield against measured data. The normalized RMSE were 3%, 2%, 11.8%, and 3.4% for anthesis date, maturity date, grain yield and biomass, respectively. Optimum sowing window was different among locations. It was opened and closed on 5 November and 5 December for Ahvaz; 5 November and 15 December for Behbehan and Dezful;and 1 November and 15 December for Izeh, respectively. CERES-Wheat model could be used as a tool to evaluate the effect of sowing date on wheat performance in Khuzestan conditions. Further model evaluations might also be needed for other cultivars which are released for this region.

N2  - Water is a key input to agricultural production and therefore fluctuations in water availability may impact agricultural productivity and revenue. Climate science tells us that most of these fluctuations are increasingly resulting from intra-year, instead of interyearly, shifts in the timing and intensity of rainfall. Consequently predictions of the economic effects of these fluctuations would likely differ depending on how these shifts are taken into account by the empirical models. To investigate this, the present paper introduces a novel hydro-economic model in which the timing and intensity of rainfall affect the productivity of a partially irrigated agricultural system in Brazil. The specification of the production function is designed to reflect intra-year, in a monthly or seasonal basis, and interyearly shifts on rainfall to show how the opportunity cost of supplementary irrigation supply varies with changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall. Results suggest that the timing of rainfall is indeed an important economic variable and models that take into account shifts only on a yearly basis will tend to underestimate the impacts of water scarcity on agricultural income.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate eleven plum cultivars (Prunus domestica L.) for drought tolerance based on agronomic performance and various physiological traits. The experiment was carried out under field conditions in Sais Plain (NW Morocco) on eight-year-old plum trees under drip irrigation. Two water treatments were applied during the fruit set (late March) to harvest (June): a control treatment fully irrigated at 100 % of seasonal ETc (FI), and a continuous deficit treatment irrigated at 50 % of ETc (CDI). The plasticity to drought was assessed through the following traits: yield, fruit weight, number of leaves per 10 cm of shoot, wood density, leaf area, stomatal density, stomatal area, stomatal area index, chlorophyll pigments content (Cha and Chb), stomatal conductance and leaf content of cuticular waxes and proline. Results showed significant differences among cultivars in response to water stress regarding all the above mentioned traits. The cluster analysis based on mean ratios of CDI and FI treatments for all traits highlighted three distinct clusters within the studied cultivars, with regard to drought tolerance level. The PCA analysis using the above-named ratios revealed that water stress effects on fruit weight, leaf area, stomatal density, stomatal area and leaf proline content had the highest impact on discrimination among the cultivars for drought tolerance. Therefore, retained cultivars for their remarkable tolerance to drought were, in order of importance, "INRA-PR34″, "INRA-PR35″, "INRA-PR41″ and "Santa Rosa", while the cultivar "Timhdit" was the most sensitive, with a strong yield decrease of 95 %. The results herein reported identified cultivars, with high degree of plasticity in response to water deficit, suggesting their use in breeding programs aiming at improving the species drought tolerance.

N2  - Exploring how land use and the management of agro-ecosystems may evolve in the future is important for advancing scientific understanding and for informing policy makers and land managers of ways to respond and adapt sustainably to future change. In this paper, we investigate the future land-use trajectories of a semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystem in south-eastern Spain using two different approaches: Markovian cellular automata and an agent-based approach. Methodologically, the paper offers a systematic method for agent parameterization to facilitate the development of an empirical agent-based scenario analysis. This approach is achieved by integrating information from cadastral and recent land-use maps, agricultural statistics, and sampled survey data. Through this integration, an effective approach is provided for up-scaling an agent typology from the sampled survey to the landscape scale. The output of the up-scaling provides a basis for modeling the aggregate effect of the responses of different types of farmers to environmental and policy changes across the study region. Empirically, the paper highlights the contrasting futures that the studied agro-ecosystem could have depending on the direction and intensity of the changes in environmental and policy conditions. The Markovian-CA land-use projection indicates further decline of rain-fed agriculture and describes the scope of the expansion of irrigated agriculture. The agent-based scenario analysis shows that the future of irrigated agriculture is highly sensitive to the expected future water scarcity. The analysis also reveals that the way that the future environmental and policy changes are conceptualized and presented to farmers and the range of different farmers in the agro-ecosystem determine the extent of the resulting aggregate effects of individual farmer reactions to future changes at the landscape scale. The empirical evidence of this research emphasizes the need for policy makers to consider multiple and interacting factors, including the design of interventions and likely farmer responses, which shape future agricultural land-use trajectories.

N2  - Much of the developing world and areas of the developed world suffer water vulnerability. Engineering solutions enable technically efficient extraction and diversion of water towards areas of demand but, without rebalancing resource regeneration, can generate multiple adverse ecological and human consequences. The Banas River, Rajasthan (India), has been extensively developed for water diversion, particularly from the Bisalpur Dam from which water is appropriated by powerful urban constituencies dispossessing local people. Coincidentally, abandonment of traditional management, including groundwater recharge practices, is leading to increasingly receding and contaminated groundwater. This creates linked vulnerabilities for rural communities, irrigation schemes, urban users, dependent ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide, compounded by climate change and population growth. This paper addresses vulnerabilities created by fragmented policy measures between rural development, urban and irrigation water supply and downstream consequences for people and wildlife. Perpetuating narrowly technocentric approaches to resource exploitation is likely only to compound emerging problems. Alternatively, restoration or innovation of groundwater recharge practices, particularly in the upper catchment, can represent a proven, ecosystem-based approach to resource regeneration with linked beneficial socio-ecological benefits. Hybridising an ecosystem-based approach with engineered methods can simultaneously increase the security of rural livelihoods, piped urban and irrigation supplies, and the vitality of river ecosystems and their services to beneficiaries. A renewed policy focus on local-scale water recharge practices balancing water extraction technologies is consistent with emerging Rajasthani policies, particularly Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (‘water self-reliance mission’). Policy reform emphasising recharge can contribute to water security and yield socio-economic outcomes through a systemic understanding of how the water system functions, and by connecting goals and budgets across multiple, currently fragmented policy areas. The underpinning principles of this necessary paradigm shift are proven and have wider geographic relevance, though context-specific research is required to underpin robust policy and practical implementation.

N2  - As rainfall becomes scarcer or more erratic, we rely more on irrigation systems for agricultural and human water provision. Impacts of irrigation canals such as the barrier effect on wildlife movements are poorly documented. Although canal culverts and overpasses can be used by wildlife, little is known about their crossing behavior to guide barrier effect mitigation efforts. Over seven years, we recorded medium-sized carnivore crossings by video-surveillance through 30 culverts and 28 overpasses in a large irrigation project in south-central Portugal. We examined the influence of the structures’ features and landscape context on the likelihood of canal crossing. Culvert crossings were positively influenced by the proportion of nearby montado, a high nature value farming system. Overpass crossings were more likely in areas away from paved roads and with more nearby wetlands. Overpasses increased the crossing rates by about 11% relative to culverts and both were crossed more often in landscapes with evenly distributed land uses. In the project area, 20% of the montado has recently transitioned to irrigated agriculture, and wetlands have increased by 43%. It is therefore plausible that the increase in the crossing rate of overpasses relative to culverts will be accentuated. Our study produced the first evidence of a contrast in crossing rates among irrigation canal crossing structures. We have shown that the landscape can be a driver of animal crossings but irrigation projects can in turn be transformative of the landscape. Broadly, the fact that the deployment of irrigation canals may favor some land uses over others creates a conundrum that needs careful consideration when planning barrier effect mitigation interventions.

N2  - This study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The bi-objectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers’ priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management. The upcoming researches can concentrate on developing a third objective like social concerns and accordingly tri-objective games would be applied instead of bi-objective ones.

N2  - Overpumping of the Ogallala Aquifer in western Kansas due to expansion of irrigated agriculture is believed to have resulted in reductions in water storage volumes and drops in the water table in several regions. It is widely agreed upon that water demand should be reduced through increases in water use efficiency to make irrigated agriculture in the region more sustainable. The existence of several terms related to the efficiency with which irrigation water is used, however, may be hampering the development of appropriate water conservation policies. In particular, while there has been an emphasis on increasing water application efficiencies of irrigation systems, little empirical testing has been done on the effects of such changes on water use efficiency. The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the impacts of irrigation system type, as well as other variables, on irrigation water use efficiency for a sample of 43 irrigators in western Kansas between 1992 and 1999. The use of panel data permits both cross-sectional and temporal comparisons, with the latter being particularly relevant as there was a large-scale shift in irrigation system types during the study period. The method used to quantify water use efficiency or, more specifically, excess irrigation water used, is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Based upon linear programming techniques, DEA creates a “best practice” production frontier based on the irrigators that produced their level of crop output with the least amount of water. What is implied is that those who are able to produce their output levels using the least amount of water are better water managers. These farms then serve as benchmarks against which the water use inefficiency of all other irrigators, or amount of “excess water” used, can be measured. The relationship between the magnitude of irrigation water excess, or reduction potentials, and irrigation system type and a number of other farm characteristics are then determined. A major finding of the study is that there is only a weak relationship between irrigation system type and the level of excess irrigation water used. In particular, flood irrigation systems are not clearly inefficient and management may play a significant role in the levels of water use efficiency that can be reached. Additional results indicate positive relationships between water excess and age of farmer, negative relationships between water excess and farm size, and differences in water excesses between farms located in different groundwater management districts.

N2  - Turfgrass phenotyping is a potential tool in different grass program breeding. The traditional methods for turfgrass drought phenotyping in field are time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, remote sensing techniques emerge as effective, rapid and easy approaches to optimize turfgrass selection under water stress. Remote sensing approaches are considerate as important strategies to select species of turfgrass tolerable to drought allowing green space sustainability and environment protection in regions with water limitation. Here we evaluated differences between six mixtures of C3-C4 turfgrass grown under two water regimes (limited and high irrigation). The performance of turf species was achieved using the green area (GA) vegetation index calculated from RGB (red green, blue) images obtained by ground camera and drone imagery, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the plant canopy temperature (CT) and soil moisture content (SM). Both vegetation (GA and NDVI) and water status (CT and SM) indices presented a significant difference in turfgrass growth under the two water regimes. Differences among turfgrass species were detected under limited and high irrigation using the vegetation indices. Both NDVI and GA allowed clear separation between drought-tolerant and susceptible turfgrass, as well as the identification of the mixtures with a rapid green regeneration after a period of limited irrigation. Moreover, the canopy temperature also discriminated between turfgrass species but only under limited irrigation, while soil moisture values did not differentiate between species. Furthermore, the regression and conceptual model using remote sensing parameters revealed the most adequate criteria to detect turfgrass variability under each growing condition. This study also highlights the usefulness of green area vegetation index derived from drone imagery. GA obtained by drone images in this study explained turfgrass variability better than that derived from ground RGB images or the NDVI.

N2  - CONTEXT
Until May 2021, the policy regime of the Government of Sri Lanka was to import and provide chemical fertilizer at subsidized rates to small-holder farmers. On May 6, 2021, the government imposed a ban on import of chemical fertilizers and subsidy was directed to organic fertilizers. Due to heavy protests by the farming community, the import ban was lifted in November 2021. By that time, fertilizer prices in the world market had sharply escalated making chemical fertilizers quite an expensive source of nutrients.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this paper is to assess the implications of different fertilizer policy scenarios on land use, profitability, shadow prices of resources, and environmental damages in paddy, maize and vegetable- based cropping systems in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka.
METHOD
A bio-economic model was developed and simulated for five policy scenarios for the Mahakanumulla tank village in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka demonstrating (i) conventional agriculture, (ii) enhanced availability of organic fertilizers, (iii) removal of subsidy on chemical fertilizers, (iv) premium prices for chemical fertilizer free produce, and (v) a composite shock accommodating (ii), (iii) and (iv) above. The above simulations were run “with” and “without” water constraints to depict tank village systems and similar systems under major irrigation schemes respectively under varying limits of chemical fertilizers. Paddy, maize and vegetable, cultivated using two technologies, i.e., intensive use of chemical fertilizers and intensive use of organic fertilizers, were taken as decision variables.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The results of the analysis showed that under the conventional agriculture scenario, paddy and maize cultivation was the preferred choice for profit maximizing farmers in the tank village. When chemical fertilizers were restricted, farmers abandoned paddy and maize cultivation. Chemical fertilizers were available in sufficient quantities, even without a subsidy, profits reduce only by 13.56%. Maximum returns from crop cultivation were reaped when chemical and organic fertilizers were available in sufficient quantities and a premium price for products cultivated with organic fertilizers is secured. The cost of restricting chemical fertilizer application is severe in agricultural systems where water is abundant.
SIGNIFICANCE
A policy environment that secures markets for chemical fertilizer free food products is needed to make cropping systems more financially and environmentally sustainable. Stringent restrictions on quantity limits on chemical fertilizers use can affect profitability of cropping systems with no significant gains in environmental quality.

N2  - Drought is a common characteristic of the African Sahel whose agricultural productivity has been notoriously varying and declining as a result of this natural hazard. In this study, reasonably adequate climatic and food crop data for Sudan have been used to illustrate a straightforward method for assessing the recent past and within-season drought risk to sorghum and millet yields in Eastern Sahel. A drought risk index (DRI), which incorporates the drought occurrence frequency, duration, severity and areal extent in addition to the coping capacity and the production level, has been able to capture the large-scale droughts that induced crop failure and famines in the region during the recent history. Over 1970–2006, the drought risk was manifest in 15–21 years for sorghum and in 12–20 years for millet. In these particular years, the index is capable of explaining ∼52–69% and ∼32–66% of the variations in the regional states’ yields of the two major food crops, respectively. There is a co-existence between the drought risk years and the warm events of El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results indicate clearly that drought conditions are capable of putting the crop yield at risk of suppression. On the state scale, the highest drought risk predominates in Northern Darfur on the average. Maximum DRI values of 47% for sorghum and 48% for millet occurred during the peak drought decade of the 1980s in the western part of the Eastern Sahel region. It is not hard to trace the low drought risk values for Gezira within the arid region to a large extent back to practised adaptation measure in the form of irrigation. On the regional scale, the maximum DRI was recorded in 1984 as 21% and 26% respectively for sorghum and millet. Generally, lower relation between millet yield and DRI, though significant, dominates in the western part of Sahelian Sudan, likely due to the inherent adaptation of the crop to such adverse growing conditions. In view of the regional agricultural expansion, even the average irrigation coping capacity of sorghum farming dropped from 8.0% in the early 1970s to around 6.0% in the first half of the 2000s. The model is also shown to enable short-term prediction by informing knowledge of pre-harvest quantities of crop yield from easily accessible data. The outcome of this study thus assists in providing a basis for drought mitigation and planning of benefit to authorities in agriculture.

N2  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is one of the largest programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that encourages farmers and ranchers to establish resource-conserving vegetative covers to address soil, water and related resource issues on their lands. This research study examines the relationship between the CRP and the changes in the groundwater levels within Texas County in the Oklahoma Panhandle region. The region overlies the central portion of the High Plains Aquifer that has shown significant decline in groundwater levels, due largely to the development of irrigated agriculture. Using the calibrated SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model and GIS-based analysis, a significant spatial correlation (γ=−0.81 at 90% confidence level) was observed between the percentage of CRP and the difference in groundwater levels between 1990 and 2000 time periods. Thus, there is a significant potential for the CRP to increase groundwater recharge and help decrease the rate of decline in groundwater levels. Studies such as this will help justify long-term environmental benefits of the CRP, and also greatly aid in policy formulation. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of GIS-based modeling approach to facilitate efficient and effective decision making in land use planning.

N2  - During the last quarter of the 20th century, many irrigation schemes were constructed along the bank of the Senegal River in Mauritania. About 40,000ha were developed but less than 23,000ha remain irrigated today. A program for rehabilitation is now in place to counteract deterioration and abandonment of these schemes. This paper presents an evaluation of the rehabilitation of a small, representative irrigation scheme governed by a farmers’ cooperative in the village of Bélinabé. Before rehabilitation, the scheme covered 37.7ha comprising 107 plots each of 0.33ha, essentially all devoted to production of rice. Water for irrigation was pumped directly from the river into two head basins and distributed through open canals. After rehabilitation, the scheme was extended to 115ha with new plots averaging 0.36ha. Water is now supplied by a single cluster of pumps and conveyed through pipes and open canals. Evaluation of performance consisted in analysis of: capacity; distribution losses; flexibility, adequacy and reliability of the system; maintenance status; farmer's perception of system performance. Field data were collected during irrigation campaigns before rehabilitation in 2004 and during 2006 and 2007 afterwards. A model of network distribution and field water balance was developed to assist evaluation. It was established that before rehabilitation the scheme could operate satisfactorily if proper maintenance were practiced. After rehabilitation, more families have access to irrigation but reliability and flexibility of water distribution have been reduced. Furthermore, pumping capacity is now insufficient to cover crop water requirements. Recommendations are provided for future rehabilitation work and maintenance of schemes generally.

N2  - Studies reveal that 80% of the world's agricultural land is showing signs of moderate levels of soil erosion. On the other hand, it is a fact that water is becoming a more scarce resource jeopardizing food security. Thus, conserving both water and soil are two of the most pressing issues in international agriculture and food production. This article examines the impact of natural, social, human, and financial capital variables on the adoption of water conservation and soil conservation (WC&SC) as a joint decision, using a bivariate model. Socioeconomic and production information was collected by surveying a random sample of 319 small-scale irrigated farms in central Chile in 2005. The results suggest that the adoption of WC&SC is a joint and complementary decision. The results also indicate that farm size, production system, access to credit, and government incentives are important variables associated with the adoption of conservation measures. From a policy stand point, the institutions in charge of providing incentives and administering instruments intended to promote conservation should take into account the complementarity of the adoption decisions. Program designs should incorporate incentives that jointly promote the adoption of WC&SC in order to enhance effectiveness.

N2  - A full-scale geotextile-reinforced soil wall was built in order to assess the characteristics of water infiltration and its effect on the structure performance. Nonwoven geotextiles were selected as inclusions in order to provide not only reinforcement, but also internal drainage to the fine-grained soil used as backfill material. The structure was built in a laboratory setting, which facilitated implementation of a thorough instrumentation plan to measure volumetric water content changes of soil, suction, facing displacements and reinforcement strains. An irrigation system was used to simulate controlled rainfall events. The monitoring program allowed the evaluation of the advancement of infiltration and internal geosynthetic drainage. Evaluation of the effect of the hydraulic response on the overall performance of the structure included assessment of the development of capillary breaks at soil-geotextiles interfaces. Capillary breaks resulted in water storage above the geotextile reinforcements and led to retardation of the infiltration front in comparison to the infiltration that would occur without the presence of permeable reinforcements. After breakthrough, water was also found to migrate along the geotextiles, suggesting that the reinforcement layers ultimately provided in-plane drainage capacity. While generation of positive pore water pressures was not evidenced during the tests, the advancing infiltration front was found to affect the performance of the wall. Specifically, infiltration led to increasing reinforcement strains and facing displacements, as well as to the progressive loss of suction. While the accumulation of water due to the temporary capillary break also resulted in an increased backfill unit weight, its effect on deformation of the wall was not possible to be captured but it is intrinsic on the overall behavior observed in this study. Correlations between reinforcement strains/face displacement and the average of suction in the backfill soil, as measured by tensiometers in different locations within the backfill mass, point to the relevance of the suction as a representative indicator of the deformability of the geotextile-reinforced wall subjected to water infiltration. Reinforcement strains and face displacements were found to reduce more significantly with reduction of suction until a certain value of suction from which the rate of decreasing declines.

N2  - The lower catchment area of a Mak Hiao river system is vulnerable to flash floods and water stress. So it is important to construct irrigation structures in this area to minimize floods during the rainy season and store water for the winter season. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the Government of Laos in constructing such small reservoirs like Donkhuay schemes 1 & 2, Mak Hiao, Nalong 3 and Sang Houabor projects in lower catchment areas. Our study evaluated the impacts of small irrigation schemes in terms of land-use/land-cover (LULC), crop intensity, and productivity changes, using high resolution satellite imagery, socioeconomic, and ground data. We analyzed the temporal cropping pattern in the Vientiane prefecture of Laos using Planet and Sentinel-2 data. On the other hand, crop intensity and cropland changes were mapped using Sentinel-2 data and spectral matching techniques (SMTs). The crop classification accuracy based on field-plot data was 88.6%. Our results show that irrigation projects in the lower catchment areas brought about significant on-site changes in terms of cropland expansion and increased crop intensity. Remarkable changes in LULC were observed especially in the command areas owing to an increase of about 300% in crop area with access to irrigation and increase of water bodies by 31%. Our study found that interventions at the level of the command area do improved on-site soil, water and environmental services. They study emphasized underline the role of land-use regulations in reducing pressure on natural land-use systems and thereby serving the major goal of up-scaling sustainable natural resource management. The study documented the vital role of small/medium irrigation projects in restoring ecosystem services such as cropping patterns and LULC conversion.

N2  - Data and technology are available to support a real-time irrigation
smartphone app for turf that would result in more efficient irrigation
scheduling which is needed to reduce water volumes applied and increase
irrigation water conservation. Objectives were to (1) develop a turf
irrigation smartphone app for warm season turf that would generate
real-time irrigation schedules for users to program automatic timers and
(2) evaluate app performance in regards to turf quality and water
volumes applied with a field plot study. A smartphone app was developed
and tested in a plot study in Homestead, Florida, USA, from December
2013 to November 2014. Study treatments included different irrigation
scheduling methods: time-based schedule, smartphone app, and two on-site
evapotranspiration (ET) controllers. Results indicated that the app and
ET controllers resulted in significantly lower irrigation depths
compared to the time-based treatment, ranging in water savings from 42%
to 57%. The difference among the app and ET controllers was how
rainfall was integrated into the schedule. Use of the seasonal water
conservation model in the smartphone app is recommended to compensate
for the lack of on-site rainfall measurements in the generated
irrigation schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - A hydrological–economic model is introduced to describe the dynamics of groundwater-dependent economics (agriculture and tourism) for sustainable use in sparse-data drylands. The Amtoudi Oasis, a remote area in southern Morocco, in the northern Sahara attractive for tourism and with evidence of groundwater degradation, was chosen to show the model operation. Governing system variables were identified and put into action through System Dynamics (SD) modeling causal diagrams to program basic formulations into a model having two modules coupled by the nexus ‘pumping’: (1) the hydrological module represents the net groundwater balance (G) dynamics; and (2) the economic module reproduces the variation in the consumers of water, both the population and tourists. The model was operated under similar influx of tourists and different scenarios of water availability, such as the wet 2009–2010 and the average 2010–2011 hydrological years. The rise in international tourism is identified as the main driving force reducing emigration and introducing new social habits in the population, in particular concerning water consumption. Urban water allotment (PU) was doubled for less than a 100-inhabitant net increase in recent decades. The water allocation for agriculture (PI), the largest consumer of water, had remained constant for decades. Despite that the 2-year monitoring period is not long enough to draw long-term conclusions, groundwater imbalance was reflected by net aquifer recharge (R) less than PI+PU (G<0) in the average year 2010–2011, with net lateral inflow from adjacent Cambrian formations being the largest recharge component. R is expected to be much less than PI+PU in recurrent dry spells. Some low-technology actions are tentatively proposed to mitigate groundwater degradation, such as: wastewater capture, treatment, and reuse for irrigation; storm-water harvesting for irrigation; and active maintenance of the irrigation system to improve its efficiency.

N2  - This study analyzes the water availability in the Conchos River basin (Northern México) through the amount and frequency of the precipitation. Precipitation is associated with the environmental flows in determining how much of the flow in the river has been altered by the effects of climate change or human influence. Changes in water were determined by two precipitation periods: before (1961–1983) and after (1984–2008), using a climatological mesh database created by Center of Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada. Two periods for their differences in the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated. IHA V7 program was used for the analysis of environmental flows. In the after period, there were significant increases in precipitation during the rainy season, with a substantial decrease in minimum precipitations and in the number of storms. On the other hand, during the dry season, it rained less, making the climate extreme and indicating a change in the humidity patterns. There was a total alteration of the environmental flows of the river. This aspect generated a total loss of the frequency, magnitude, duration, and periodicity of the environmental flows during the year due to the management of the dam for electricity generation, irrigation, and flood control, altering the composition, structure and function of the riparian ecosystem. However, the synergic effect of climate on the water availability was observed. Advantage of determining environmental flows is that decision-makers can know how many changes have been introduced into the river flow patterns by human consumption or by climate change.

N2  - Smart farming based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enables crop farmers to collect real-time data related to irrigation and plant protection processes, aiming to increase production volume and improve product quality, predict diseases, while optimizing resources and farming processes. Digital Ecosystem Utilisation (in short CYSLOP) is a use case of the Internet of Food and Farm 2020 (IoF2020) project that aims to demonstrate IoT solutions in vegetable farms in Cyprus and Slovenia. More particularly, this chapter is focused on the pilots taking place in Cyprus. The use case objectives are (i) to drive IoT uptake in countries where IoF2020 was not initially present, (ii) to prove the sustainability of those IoT interventions cost-wise and environmentally wise, and (iii) to unveil their potential for postfarm and/or consumer-oriented applications. In this chapter, however, the writers concentrate on (a) studying the current state of the art in IoT in agriculture, their applications and implications, (b) analyzing the prospects and problems of smart farming through a case study of installation of IoT devices in Cyprus, under the IoF2020 project, (c) discussing business models associated with smart farming proposed solutions, and (d) presenting technical approaches to expand multivendor IoT offerings, regionally. The selected pilot areas are located in the mountainous Limassol district where the cultivations under study are aronia, goji berries, and raspberries (four plots), and in coastal Ammochostos district with two plots of open-field strawberries and cherry tomatoes (under hydroponic cultivation). The expected environmental, economic, and social impacts involve efficiency improvement in terms of pesticide and water use reduction between 5% and 10%, respective cost reduction of 10%, reduction of farm visits by 20%, and more than 20 newly deployed IoT devices. Lastly, by incorporating innovative traceability technology, this use case is among the first to integrate information from the entire food value chain (from farm to fork) to a marketplace, offering elaborate value propositions to users. The aim of this work is to guide the reader through the multidisciplinary approach needed for a successful IoT agrifood project execution, to unveil the complex technical, business, and support relationships that these inherit, and to pave a way to make it a sustainable and replicable case for the digital transformation of the local sector.

N2  - Background
Home gardening is a strategy to improve nutrition and food security. More information is needed about optimizing gardens in different contexts.
Objective
The aim was to identify implementation barriers and facilitators for a home gardening intervention in rural Guatemala and inform future larger-scale interventions in the region.
Design
A mixed-methods implementation study using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was conducted from January 2019 to July 2020.
Participants/setting
Families (n = 70) in rural Guatemala participated in the intervention. Staff (n = 4), families (n = 6), and community stakeholders (n = 3) participated in interviews or focus groups.
Intervention
Participating households received seeds and seedlings for 16 crops, garden construction materials, agronomist-delivered education and assistance, and a standard-of-care nutrition program.
Main outcome measures
Implementation data were collected from program records and observations, participant surveys, and interviews and focus groups. Crop count and nutritional functional diversity of home gardens were assessed.
Statistical analyses performed
Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative outcomes. Qualitative data were double-coded and organized into overarching themes.
Results
Reach: Ninety percent of eligible households participated. Child nutritional eligibility criteria was a barrier to reach. Effectiveness: Participants and stakeholders felt the intervention improved access to diverse foods. Cultivated crops increased an average of five species (95% confidence interval [CI], 4–6) at 6 months, although not all were consumed. Adoption: The main community adoption barrier was water sourcing for garden irrigation. Implementation: Raised beds were the most common gardening method, with good adoption of agricultural best practices. Gray water filters and flexible implementation were important for participation. Maintenance: Crops failure rates were low. Seed availability was a sustainability challenge. Direct costs were 763 USD per household.
Conclusions
Interest and engagement with a home garden intervention in Guatemala were high. Gaps between garden production and consumption, access to water, and seed sourcing should be addressed in future work.

N2  - In this study, a nonlinear fuzzy interval irrigation optimization model is developed for optimal agricultural water allocation in Shijin irrigation district, Hebei province, China. The developed method can deal with interval values and fuzzy numbers in a nonlinear objective and a set of constraints including water availability, evapotranspiration, reservoir water priority, fairness, etc. Three different scenarios (under dry, normal, and wet years) were considered. As the result, the optimal water allocation schemes, both from reservoir water and ground water, were obtained. Under fuzzy degree of membership level that equals to 1.0, the system benefits are 1.53×109 RMB for dry years, 1.61×109 RMB for normal years and 1.61×109 RMB for wet years. The solutions can not only provide an effective evaluation under preset scenarios, but also reveal the associated economic implications. Three aspects have been improved in this study compared with previous studies: (1) the model has capability of incorporating multiple water resources, multiple subareas, multiple crops, and multiple growth stages of water resources management within the optimization framework; (2) in order to address the uncertain parameters which are not sufficient or imprecise in the practical problems, a nonlinear fuzzy interval irrigation optimization model (NFIIOM) is developed by incorporating interval parameters programming and fuzzy programming; (3) after applying the developed model to a real case study, the reasonable solutions has been gotten and the results can be used to help the manager to establish effective water allocation plan for agricultural irrigation systems under uncertainty, and thus maximize the benefit of local farmers.

N2  - Little is known about the economy-wide repercussions of water buyback, which may include relevant feedbacks on the output of economic sectors at a regional and supra-regional scale. Limited studies available rely on stand-alone Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models that represent competition for water explicitly, but this approach presents significant data and methodological challenges in areas where mature water markets are not in place –the case of most regions worldwide. To bridge this gap, this paper couples a microeconomic Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming (PMAUP) model that elicits the value and price share to water with a macroeconomic, regionally-calibrated CGE model for Spain. Methods are illustrated with a case study in the Murcia Region in southeastern Spain. Economy-wide feedbacks amplify income losses in Murcia's agriculture from −20.5% in the PMAUP model up to −33% in the coupled PMAUP-CGE model. Compensations paid to irrigators enhance demand in the region, but supply contraction in agriculture and related sectors lead to overall GDP losses (up to −2.1%) in most scenarios. The supply gap is partially filled in by other Spanish regions, which experience a GDP gain through a substitution effect (up to +.034%). In all scenarios, aggregate GDP for Spain decreases (up to −.023%).

N2  - The objective of this paper is to address the problems of inefficiency and inequity in water allocation in the El Angel watershed, located in Ecuador's Sierra region. Water is captured in a high-altitude region of the watershed and distributed downstream to producers in four elevation-defined zones via a system of canals. Upstream and downstream producers face radically different conditions with respect to climate and terrain. A mathematical programming model was created to study the consequences of addressing chronic water scarcity problems in the watershed by shifting water resources between the four zones. The model captures the nature of water use by humans, crops and dual purpose cattle. Its objective function maximizes producer welfare as measured by aggregate gross margin, subject to limited supplies of land, labor and water. Five water allocation scenarios are evaluated with respect to efficiency in land and water use and equity in income distribution. Results reveal that although water is the primary constrained resource downstream, in the upstream zones, land is far more scarce. The current distribution of water rights does not consider these differences and therefore is neither efficient nor equitable. Improvements in efficiency (resource use) and equity (income distribution) are associated with (1) a shift of water to the lower zone, and (2) the use of lower levels of irrigation intensity upstream. Furthermore, the scenarios that result in the most efficient use of resources also bring the greatest degree of equity in income distribution, indicating that these may be complementary, not conflicting, goals.

N2  - Sewage sludges are increasingly used in soil amendment programmes, although not without risk since they contain, among other potential hazards, high concentrations of total coliform bacteria. In this paper we have studied the effect of irrigation on the survival of total coliforms in three semiarid degraded soils with different agricultural practices. Fresh sewage sludge was added at 50gkg−1 soil, and incubated in both the presence and absence of irrigation. The absence of irrigation led to a sharp decrease in the number of total coliforms in all soils, with the bacteria disappearing in 40 days. Irrigation produced a substantial initial increase in the number of coliforms in the three soils, although after 80 days there was none growing in any of the soils. The results showed that there were significant differences in the survival of coliform bacteria due to the presence or absence of irrigation.

N2  - The lack of water resources limits sustainable agricultural production in the Loess Plateau region of China, and optimizing field management practices to improve crop water use efficiency (WUE) is a key strategy to solve this problem. However, there is no consensus among researchers on the most appropriate field management practices regarding WUE, which requires further integrated quantitative analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis by computing 1338 effect sizes from 171 publications to quantify the effect of agricultural practices (nitrogen (N) fertilizer management, mulching management, water-saving irrigation, straw return and conservation tillage) on crop WUE. Our results showed that N fertilizer management (51.83% increase, P < 0.05) is the most effective practice for improving the crop WUE, followed by mulching management (17.44% increase, P < 0.05), water-saving irrigation (15.97% increase, P < 0.05), straw return (10.00% increase, P < 0.05), and conservation tillage (5.09% increase, P < 0.05). This study also identified the key drivers (including climatic factors, soil factors, and human intervention factors) that affect the crop WUE under various field management practices. For example, the mean annual precipitation, annual evaporation, soil type, pH, soil total nitrogen content, N application frequency, N fertilizer type, and N application rate were identified as the key factors that affect the crop WUE under N fertilizer management practices. In addition, we quantified the effects of the different drivers on the crop WUE under various field management practices by subgroup analysis, and then the drivers level with the best improvement effect of WUE was determined. Specifically, when the N application rate is 150–225 kg ha−1, the N fertilizer type is controlled release urea, the soil covering ratio is more than 0.5, the irrigation method is drip irrigation, the amount and length of straw returning is 10,001–15,000 kg ha−1 and less than 0.5 cm, etc., the improvement effect of crop WUE was the best. In a word, our results provide references for determining appropriate integrated agricultural management strategies to ensure efficient water use and sustainable production in the Loess Plateau region.

N2  - The potential farm-level gains from improvements in a tertiary canal vary among farmers according to their location along the canal. An economic model describing that variation is developed using the concept of irrigation success, which considers the degree to which water volume and quality, and the timing of irrigation events match the requirements of plants throughout a season. A bid-rent model in which farm-level costs and returns are viewed as a function of irrigation success is used to describe the appropriate roles of public agencies in supporting or financing tertiary canal improvement projects and to evaluate cost recovery programs. An empirical version of the model is used to develop cost recovery alternatives for Egypt's Irrigation Improvement Project. A potentially viable cost recovery program is designed using the following criteria: (1) the net benefits of the improvement project are non-negative for all the farmers after making any required payments; (2) the net benefits are the same for all the farmers required to make annual payments, and (3) the total revenue collected each year is equal to the average annual cost of the project. Such a program would require estimated payments of $175 per ha for middle-reach farmers and $412 per ha for tail-end farmers along a typical canal in Egypt's Irrigation Improvement Project. The net benefits for farmers in each of those groups would be an estimated $102 per ha. Head-end farmers would not be required to pay an annual fee, though they would receive a net gain equal to an estimated $40 per ha reduction in annual pumping costs. Alternative programs that require smaller payments from middle-reach and tail-end farmers, while imposing costs also on head-end farmers, are designed using a combination of fixed and variable charges. Volumetric water charges ranging from $4.00 to $7.00 per 1000m3 are examined, in conjunction with annual assessments ranging from $40 to $170 per ha. The installation of single-point pumping stations at the head ends of improved tertiary canals provides an opportunity to implement volumetric charges in cooperation with water user associations.

N2  - Individual effect of different field scale management interventions for water saving in rice viz. changing date of transplanting, cultivar and irrigation schedule on yield, water saving and water productivity is well documented in the literature. However, little is known about their integrated effect. To study that, field experimentation and modeling approach was used. Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2006 and 2007) at Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana on a deep alluvial loamy sand Typic Ustipsamment soils developed under hyper-thermic regime. Treatments included three dates of transplanting (25 May, 10 June and 25 June), two cultivars (PR 118 inbred and RH 257 hybrid) and two irrigation schedules (2-days drainage period and at soil water suction of 16kPa). The model used was CropSyst, which has already been calibrated for growth (periodic biomass and LAI) of rice and soil water content in two independent experiments. The main findings of the field and simulation studies conducted are compared to any individual, integrated management of transplanting date, cultivar and irrigation, sustained yield (6.3–7.5tha−1) and saved substantial amount of water in rice. For example, with two management interventions, i.e. shifting of transplanting date to lower evaporative demand (from 5 May to 25 June) concomitant with growing of short duration hybrid variety (90 days from transplanting to harvest), the total real water saving (wet saving) through reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) was 140mm, which was almost double than managing the single, i.e. 66mm by shifting transplanting or 71mm by growing short duration hybrid variety. Shifting the transplanting date saved water through reduction in soil water evaporation component while growing of short duration variety through reduction in both evaporation and transpiration components of water balance. Managing irrigation water schedule based on soil water suction of 16kPa at 15–20cm soil depth, compared to 2-day drainage, did not save water in real (wet saving), however, it resulted into apparent water saving (dry saving). The real crop water productivity (marketable yield/ET) was more by 17% in 25th June transplanted rice than 25th May, 23% in short duration variety than long and 2% in irrigation treatment of 16kPa soil water suction than 2-days drainage. The corresponding values for the apparent crop water productivity (marketable yield/irrigation water applied) were 16, 20 and 50%, respectively. Pooled experimental data of 2 years showed that with managing irrigation scheduling based on soil water suction of 16kPa at 15–20cm soil depth, though 700mm irrigation water was saved but the associated yield was reduced by 277kgha−1.

N2  - To minimize and counter decline of groundwater levels and improve the availability of water for crop production, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) interventions are widely adopted across India, often initiated or supported by, local communities, state and central governments to improve the availability of water for irrigation. While the literature on MAR in India is vast, the science of their construction is lacking. Furthermore, there is an absence of a structured approach to evaluate the performance and impact of MAR interventions. Often, performance and impacts of MAR have been commented upon together, without distinguishing the two. In this article, we aim to propose that performance and impact are different from each other, and that the evaluation of MAR interventions should take into account such differences between them. A framework for performance and impact analysis, based on three levels, viz. primary, secondary and tertiary, is outlined. It is then applied to seven selected MAR interventions in India, Adarsha watershed – Andhra Pradesh, Gokulpura-Goverdhanpura watershed – Rajasthan, Kodangipalayam watershed – Tamil Nadu, Chikalgaon watershed – Maharashtra, Rajasamadhiyala watershed – Gujarat, Satlasana watershed – Gujarat and Sujalam Sufalam Yojana – Gujarat. Although, the evaluations of these case studies reported were not categorized into performance and impact, most of them have addressed both. However, none of them could explicitly demonstrate that reported impacts were uniquely related to MAR interventions. If impacts are used as a surrogate for performance, it must be shown that impacts are uniquely linked to MAR interventions.

N2  - To explore the complexity of temporal and spatial dynamics of an agricultural landscape under various external and internal driven scenarios, SimKat, an agent-based model, has been developed with the simulation computer program CORMAS. This model combines simplified bio-physical processes of land cover, regional dry-land salinity changes, rainfall impact on productivity, farm profitability and the complexity of land-use decisions of individual farmers in a dry-land agricultural catchment (no irrigation). In this model, simulated farmers formulate individual decisions dealing with land-use changes based on the combined performance of their past land cover productivity and market returns. The willingness to adapt to market drivers and the ability to maximize returns vary between farmers. In addition, farmers in the model can demonstrate various attitudes towards dry-land salinity mitigation as a consequence of experiencing and perceiving salinity on their farm, in the neighborhood or across the entire region. Consequently, farmers can adopt land cover strategies aimed at reducing dry-land salinity. Aggregating the simulated individual behavior of farmers combined with historical rainfall and market price records, reproduced similar aggregated trends of land-cover changes, regional salinity change and farm number decline as observed in the last 20 years in the subject region (Katanning, Western Australia). Using the model in an initial exploratory study on the impact of rainfall variability and change highlighted the importance of average rainfall decline and the widespread willingness of farmers to adapt perennial vegetation in their farming systems to combat regional dry-land salinity. Rainfall decline, as one of the observed consequences of climate change in this region, can also lead to prolonged sequences of dry seasons in the future. Adaptation by farmers to sequences of dry and wet seasons, rather than an average trend in rainfall, seems to be critical for farm survival in this region. Intensifying cropping during wet seasons to maximize farm returns can increase vulnerability in subsequent periods of dry seasons, in particular where alternative income from pasture and sheep production has been lost in the adaptation process.

N2  - Water is essential to life sustainability and the development of industry and agriculture in Kuwait. Kuwait is faced with water shortages, because of the scarcity of the natural water resources; well-developed supply infrastructure; and the practice of expanding irrigated agriculture and industrialization. This paper describes how to evaluate different management options and policies on the strategic level that can lead to secure and sustainable water resources management in the future for all water users in Kuwait. Possible interventions/management options are identified and evaluated using a decision- support tool based on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology. This paper is the first of its kind to use trade-off between different management options and strategic policies in Kuwait. The results showed that desalination using renewable energy technologies was ranked highly, despite its economic cost and environmental impact but there is also a need to implement widely other options. Wastewater Reuse for agriculture was ranked first overall in the MCDA. Most brackish water supply to the agricultural sector should be replaced by treated wastewater. Other options such as virtual water, water demand management and changes in agricultural policies should be prioritized because of their socio-economic and environmental benefits.

N2  - This study has examined traditional coping systems, emerging adaptation strategies and barriers to the adoption of these strategies. Structured questionnaires on coping and adaptation strategies were conducted among Nyangatom households, expounded by focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Correlations between times series (1987–2016) on rainfall, temperature and the local perceptions on CC were examined. The time series analysis confirmed pastoralists' perception that the frequency of extreme drought has increased since 1987. The Nyangatom responded by temporal migration and herd diversification. Other responses include flood cultivation and enhancing alliance formation with other ethnic groups. Multi-nominal logistic regression analyses indicated that age of household head (−), livestock ownership (+), crop productivity (+), off-farm income (+) and access to climate information (+) proved to be key determinants with a statistically significant (negative or positive) effect on adoption. Other factors that hindered climate change adaption include intermittent conflicts with neighbouring ethnic groups and limited access to alternative livelihood options. Interventions to facilitate transition towards sustainable, adaptation-based communities need to incorporate deliberate, longer-term, risk-reducing strategies, including rangeland management, water harvesting and small scale-irrigation schemes. Improved education access, extension services, and a conducive pastoral policy environment will help to enhance the Nyangatom adaptive capacity.

N2  - The movements of the sand dunes are considered as a threat for roads, irrigation networks, water resources, urban areas, agriculture and infrastructures. The main objectives of this study are to develop a new GIS-based model for automated extraction of sand dune encroachment using remote sensing data and to assess the rate of sand dune movement. To monitor and assess the movements of sand dunes in Dakhla oases area, multi-temporal satellite images and a GIS-developed model, using Python script in Arc GIS, were used. The satellite images (SPOT images, 1995 and 2007) were geo-rectified using Erdas Imagine. Image subtraction was performed using spatial analyst in Arc GIS, the result of image subtraction obtains the sand dune movement between the two dates. The raster and vector shape of sand dune migration was automatically extracted using spatial analyst tools. The frontiers of individual dunes were measured at different dates and movement rates were analyzed in GIS. The ModelBuilder in Arc GIS was used in order to create a user friendly tool. The custom built model window is easy to handle by any user who wishes to adapt the model in his work. It was found that the rate of sand dune movement ranged between 3 and 9m per year. The majority of sand dunes have a rate movement between 0 and 6m and very few dunes had a movement rate between 6 and 9m. Integrating remote sensing and GIS provided the necessary information for determining the minimum, maximum, mean, rate and area of sand dune migration.

N2  - A variety of technologies for reducing residential irrigation water use are available to homeowners. These “Smart Irrigation” technologies include evapotranspiration (ET)-based controllers and soil moisture sensor (SMS) controllers. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of these technologies, along with rain sensors, based on irrigation applied and turfgrass quality measurements on St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walter) Kuntze). Testing was performed on two types of SMS controllers (LawnLogic LL1004 and Acclima Digital TDT RS500) at three soil moisture threshold settings. Mini-Clik rain sensors (RS) comprised six treatments at two rainfall thresholds (3mm and 6mm) and three different irrigation frequencies (1, 2, and 7d/wk). Two ET controllers were also tested, the Toro Intelli-Sense controller and the Rain Bird ET Manager. A time-based treatment with 2 days of irrigation per week without any type of sensor (WOS) to bypass irrigation was established as a comparison. All irrigation controller programming represented settings that might be used in residential/commercial landscapes. Even though three of the four testing periods were relatively dry, all of the technologies tested managed to reduce water application compared to the WOS treatment, with most treatments also producing acceptable turf quality. Reductions in irrigation applied were as follows: 7–30% for RS-based treatments, 0–74% for SMS-based treatments, and 25–62% for ET-based treatments. The SMS treatments at low threshold settings resulted in high water savings, but reduced turf quality to unacceptable levels. The medium threshold setting (approximately field capacity) SMS-based treatment produced good turfgrass quality while reducing irrigation water use compared to WOS by 11–53%. ET controllers with comparable settings and good turf quality had −20% to 59% savings. Reducing the irrigation schedule (treatment DWRS) by 40% and using a rain sensor produced water savings between 36% and 53% similar to smart controllers. Proper installation and programming of each of the technologies was essential element to balancing water conservation and acceptable turf quality. Water savings with the SMS controllers could have been increased with a reduced time-based irrigation schedule. Efficiency settings of 100% (DWRS) and 95% (TORO) did not reduce turf quality below acceptable limits and resulted in substantial irrigation savings, indicating that efficiency values need not be low in well designed and maintained irrigation systems. For most conditions in Florida, the DWRS schedule (60% of schedule used for SMS treatments) can be used with either rain sensors or soil moisture sensors in bypass control mode as long as the irrigation system has good coverage and is in good repair.

N2  - Water and land are the two most critical resources for food production and they are intricately linked. Irrigation expansion, population growth, and climate change are threatening the sustainability of water-land nexus system (WLNS). In this study, a possibilistic-flexible chance-constrained programming (PFCP) method that is capable of addressing multiple uncertainties expressed as possibilistic distributions, flexible variables, and probabilistic distributions existed in WLNS is developed. PFCP can help gain in-depth analysis of the tradeoffs between system benefit and reliability of satisfying constraints. Then, the proposed PFCP method is applied to the lower reaches of Amu Darya River basin for assessing the impact of irrigation efficiency on the WLNS management, where 1080 scenarios are analyzed in association with different irrigation schemes, violation risk levels, and satisfactory degrees. A number of water and land resources allocation alternatives for different irrigation districts and crops are generated. Results indicate that the advanced irrigation modes (e.g., sprinkle and drip) can improve irrigation efficiency and raise unit water benefit from 0.15 US$/m3 to 0.24 US$/m3. Irrigation mode with efficiency of about 0.61 is an effective option in adaption to changed water availabilities, which is beneficial for pursuing balance between water and land relationships. These findings can support decision makers implementing comprehensive agricultural management strategies (e.g., the advancement of irrigation modes as well as the optimization of water and land allocation patterns) in responding to variations in water availability, electricity consumption, and market price.

N2  - There are nearly two million ha of red jujube in the arid inland agricultural region south of the Tianshan mountains in China that produce approximately 37.2% of the global red jujube market. This paper provides an insight into the spatiotemporal variation of the water footprint and economic water productivity of red jujube cultivation in six main red jujube-producing areas. The effects of regional policies, industrial clusters, planting structures, irrigation methods and brand values studied extensively in this paper and shows how these driving factors affect the variation. Time series data covering the period of 2003–2015 was used for the study. The results showed that the annual variation of yield, cultivated areas, water footprint and economic water productivity of red jujube cultivation have experienced upward trends in the Tianshan regions, but that there were also few differences between different growing areas. The blue water makes the largest contribution (more than 70%) to the components of the red jujube water footprint in each red jujube producing area. The contribution of grey water footprint to the total consumptive WF was quite small (less than 10%) and the remaining 10%–15% was due to the green water. The water footprint and overall economic water productivity through the red jujube in various producing areas are affected by local government management and performance. The possible ways of improving economic water productivity in terms of red jujube cultivation are through policy, technological and management interventions.

N2  - The closed basin of the Lower Jordan Valley with the Dead Sea as final sink features high evapotranspiration rates and almost complete reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation farming. This study focuses on the water transfer schemes and the presence, spreading, and potential accumulation of pharmaceutical residues in the local water resources based on findings of a five-year monitoring program. Overall 16 pharmaceuticals and 9 iodinated X-ray contrast media were monitored in groundwater, surface water, and treated wastewater. A total of 95 samples were taken to cover all geographical settings and flow paths from origin (wastewater) to target (groundwater). Nine substances were detected in groundwater, with concentrations ranging between 11ng/L and 33,000ng/L. Sometimes, detection rates were higher than in comparable studies: Diatrizoic acid 75%, iopamidol 42%, iopromide 19%, iomeprol 11%, carbamazepine and iohexol 8%, ibuprofen 6%, and fenofibrate and iothalamic acid 3%. Concentrations in groundwater generally increase from north to south depending on the application of treated wastewater for irrigation. Almost all substances occurred most frequently and with highest concentrations in treated wastewater, followed by surface water and groundwater. As exception, diatrizoic acid was found more frequently in groundwater than in treated wastewater, with concentrations being similar. This indicates the persistence of diatrizoic acid with long residence times in local groundwater systems, but may also reflect changing prescription patterns, which would be in accordance with increasing iopamidol findings and surveys at local hospitals. Trend analyses confirm this finding and indicate a high probability of increasing iopamidol concentrations, while other substances did not reveal any trends. However, no proof of evaporative enrichment could be found. The high spatial and temporal variability of the concentrations measured calls for further systematic studies to assess the long-term evolution of organic trace substances in this reuse setting.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture is the dominant user of world’s fresh water which feeds the world’s growing population. Conflicts between stakeholders; incompatibility of economic, social, and environmental development; and uncertainties in water supply and demand restrict the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture. This study developed a multi-scale multi-objective programming model for simultaneous optimal allocation of irrigation water and cropland to balance conflicts between farmers’ income and sustainable development of irrigation districts (reflected in economic, social, and environmental aspects). Consideration of the joint uncertainties of water supply and demand helps provide practical and indicative schemes for agricultural water and land allocation. The developed model was applied to a real case study in an irrigation district in northeast China. Farmers’ income, net economic benefit, resources allocation equity, and global warming potential were coordinated by optimally allocating limited water and cropland resources to different crops in different subareas under different combinational scenarios of water supply and demand. The performance of the model was evaluated, based on the concept of “adaptability” which can help realize the degree of ability of the irrigated agricultural system to adapt to changing environment. The developed model can help plan irrigation water and cropland resources in a sustainable way, and can be a reference for similar irrigation systems worldwide.

N2  - Encouraging the use of more efficient irrigation technology is often viewed as an effective, politically feasible method to reduce the consumptive use of water for agricultural production. Despite its pervasive recommendation, it is not clear that increasing irrigation efficiency will lead to water conservation in practice. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a widespread conversion from traditional center pivot irrigation systems to higher efficiency dropped-nozzle center pivot systems that has occurred in western Kansas. State and national cost-share programs subsidized the conversion. On an average, the intended reduction in groundwater use did not occur; the shift to more efficient irrigation technology has increased groundwater extraction, in part due to shifting crop patterns. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Are there any economic policies able to break the vicious circle of the
poverty trap in rural areas of poor countries such as Burkina Faso? To
help answer this question, a detailed analysis of production systems has
been used to elaborate dynamic household models. A mathematical
programming model represents the economic decisions of farmers for the
three farm types found in the Plateau Central region. Farms are linked
together by factor markets. The model calculates a wide range of
variables: incomes of agricultural households and their sources, land
allocation between the different crops, cropping techniques used,
agricultural production, consumption expenditure and labor allocation
among the various activities including off-farm activities. These
estimates can be obtained by farmer groups and aggregated for the
Plateau Central. The model is used to simulate the effects of five
economic policies and their combinations: (i) increasing the
availability of irrigation water, (ii) lowering marketing costs, (iii)
access to animal traction. (iv) access to credit, (v) reducing producer
price variability. The analysis reveals different impacts in function of
the different farm groups. Public good policies benefit all groups
whereas policies aiming at improving capital market access or at
diminishing risks on product sales primarily benefit the richest group.
Policies focusing on access to equipment are of greater benefit to the
poorest. Given the depth of initial poverty, it is necessary to combine
all the measures to allow the incomes of the poorest group to cross the
poverty line. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The fiber from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) makes up approximately 90% of the global cotton produced each year. Fiber quality is important to textile mills for processing and factors into bulk cotton sales. Fiber quality can be affected by many environmental factors, including water deficit, which makes identifying major fiber characteristics an important focus for breeding programs. Cotton fibers are specialized trichomes that are primarily composed of cellulose but have a cuticle composed of free waxes and cutin. Total cuticular wax of cotton fiber has been shown to act as a lubricant during textile processing, but has also been negatively correlated with important quality traits. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the cuticular wax compounds of cotton fiber under water-limited (WL) and well-watered (WW) irrigation treatments and assess their relationship with fiber quality from seven upland cotton lines. Through the most detailed characterization of cotton fiber cuticular wax to date, 41 quantifiable compounds were identified including free fatty acids, primary alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, and tentatively identified alkanediols. Of these 41 compounds and their sum (total waxes), the abundance for nine were significantly different (α=0.05) between WL and WW conditions. Total wax and 36 compounds were highly repeatable (r≥0.60), indicating they will respond positively to selection in cotton breeding programs. Irrespective of irrigation regime, strong positive correlations (rp 0.64–0.80) were found for fiber length and uniformity with primary alcohols, fatty acids, and aldehydes. These findings suggest that the biosynthetic pathways associated with these compounds are contributing to the phenotypic variability of these two important fiber quality traits and thus the biochemical pathways associated with cuticular fiber wax are candidates for metabolic engineering via molecular breeding approaches.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Sprouts have been a recurring public health challenge due to microbiological contamination, and Salmonella has been the major cause of sprout-associated outbreaks. Although seed treatment and microbiological testing have been applied as risk reduction measures during sprout production, the extent to which their effectiveness in reducing the public health risks associated with sprouts has not been well investigated. We conducted a quantitative risk assessment to measure the risk posed by Salmonella contamination in sprouts and to determine whether and how mitigation strategies can achieve a satisfactory risk reduction based on the assumption that the risk reduction achieved by a microbiological sampling and testing program at a given sensitivity is equivalent to that achieved by direct inactivation of pathogens. Our results indicated that if the sprouts were produced without any risk interventions, the health impact caused by sprouts contaminated with Salmonella would be very high, with a median annual estimated loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 691,412. Seed treatment (with 20,000 ppm of calcium hypochlorite) or microbiological sampling and testing of spent irrigation water (SIW) alone could reduce the median annual impact to 734 or 4,856 DALYs, respectively. Combining seed treatment with testing of the SIW would further decrease the risk to 58 DALYs. This number could be dramatically lowered to 3.99 DALYs if sprouts were produced under conditions that included treating seeds with 20,000 ppm of calcium hypochlorite plus microbiological testing of seeds, SIW, and finished products. Our analysis shows that the public health impact due to Salmonella contamination in sprouts could be controlled if seeds are treated to reduce pathogens and microbiological sampling and testing is implemented. Future advances in intervention strategies would be important to improve sprout safety further.

N2  - Traditional Mediterranean irrigated lands, such as the Huerta of Murcia (Spain), constitute characteristic agroecosystems which provide several ecosystem services, both cultural and regulating. Nevertheless, these agroecosystems are threatened by factors linked to the low profitability of agricultural production under present market conditions and the land conversion to non-agricultural uses.In order to assess the perceptions and valuation of the Huerta of Murcia by the local population, an economic valuation survey was carried out, using a contingent valuation method (CVM). Based on the survey, we identified the measures that were most valued with regard to the conservation of the huerta, which were: i) Limitation of the land uptake for urban uses; ii) Creation of programs to conserve ecosystem services, by means of financial support; and iii) Initiatives to promote the production of traditional agricultural products. Finally, we included these measures in a dynamic system model that, once validated, was used to explore the potential impact of such initiatives on the expected future behavior of the Huerta of Murcia.The CVM findings show the importance given to the huerta by the population of the area, beyond the use they usually make of it. The results also allowed the determination of the amount that the local people are willing to pay for the conservation of the environmental services of the Huerta of Murcia.Moreover, the simulation results for the period 2015-2030, obtained using the model, suggest that more direct measures, such as land planning, achieve better results than indirect options, such as those derived from agricultural policy and the implementation of a payment for ecosystem services, even when these latter aspects are combined. Under a scenario combining the three measures valued most highly, the loss of these irrigated lands would be reduced by around 11.5% in 2030, compared to the base trend simulation.Although the policies analyzed would improve the situation in the short and medium term, more ambitious actions would be required for full conservation of this agroecosystem in the long run.

N2  - The scarcity of fresh water and the need to improve environmental management has led to saline water being used for agricultural purposes, and this, in turn, has to be managed in such a way that it minimizes any damage it may cause. The use of soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) sensors can play an important role in this process. This work studies whether, by setting different levels of pore water EC (ECPW) in a programmable automatic irrigation system connected to GS3-Decagon sensors, it is possible to create different saline conditions for cultivating geranium in pots irrigated with reclaimed wastewater of 5.5dSm−1 and fresh water of 1.6dSm−1 (for flushing). Five treatments were studied: the control (using fresh water) and four saline treatments programmed to provide flushing with fresh water every time that a threshold of ECPW was exceeded: 5 (T5), 5.5 (T5.5), 6 (T6) and 6.5 (T6.5) dSm−1. The saline conditions that the plants could support were evaluated in terms of growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, leaf saline ion concentrations, water consumption and drainage. At the end of the experiment, the plants of T5 showed a good ornamental appearance although they had consumed 32% less total applied water than the control. The plants of the other saline treatments were excessively small and showed poor development. The automatic irrigation system using the GS3 was capable of maintaining different conditions of salinity up to 5.5dSm−1 of ECPW.

N2  - This study relates to the Mackenzie Basin case study in New Zealand that exhibits many characteristics of public goods that requires government involvement and covers issues of efficient resource allocation decision-making between irrigation and conservation development in the basin. Many parties have different views on the proposed irrigation project and the policy debate was about whether to support the irrigation given that there are some environmental losses or to support further conservation programmes that forgo economic growth or leave the basin unchanged. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate environmental and social factors associated with irrigation and conservation development in the basin. The study applies choice experiment method by modelling realistic choice processes in ways that frame the issues of Mackenzie Basin within competing substitutes which have opposite environmental outcomes. This framing required an alternative specific experimental design for constructing the choice sets that allow respondents to consider the substitution effects directly giving them a more realistic decision-making context. This approach was compared with the traditional generic design to observe differences in terms of model parameters and willingness-to-pay (WTP) distributions. The results show that the alternative specific design has better predictive power in terms of statistical as well as behavioural interpretation.

N2  - In this study, the effectiveness of a bivariate analysis of agricultural drought characteristics for irrigation planning was evaluated. The case study was conducted in locations in central Italy and was based on olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes. For each locality, the available time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were used to simulate the daily soil water dynamics (SWt) for olive crops. The simulation was performed assuming 10 irrigation strategies, different for both the volume and date of the interventions. By applying the Theory of Runs to SWt, with a threshold corresponding to the readily available water, the agricultural drought events in the time series were identified and characterised by their duration D (days) and severity S (i.e. the cumulative evapotranspiration deficit in mm) for each locality and strategy. A 2-parameter Gamma distribution was fitted to both D and S, whilst their dependence structure was modelled by a Gumbel copula. The evaluation of the best irrigation strategy in each locality was obtained by comparing the contour lines of the pairs (d,s) having a 10-year return period for the condition D ≥ d AND S ≥ s. Results showed a great influence of both climate and irrigation strategy on the joint distribution of D and S. Some strategies, despite a very similar behaviour in the severity, differed a lot in terms of the associated values of duration, thus denoting different dynamics of water stress (more or less intense). Among the single-irrigation strategies, the optimal one was usually represented by an application at the end of June. Among the double-irrigation strategies, the optimal one involved two interventions, one at the end of June and one at the end of July. These results were also discussed taking into account the corresponding probability of consecutive severe drought events.

N1  - Water, Science, Technology and Policy Convergence and Action by All (A Meeting Point for Action leading to Sustainable Development)
N2  - The challenge of producing food for a rapidly increasing population in semi-arid agro-ecosystems in Southern Africa is daunting. More food necessarily means more consumptive use of so-called green water flow (vapour flow sustaining crop growth). Every increase in food production upstream in a watershed will impact on water user and using systems downstream. Intensifying agriculture has in the past often been carried out with negative side effects in terms of land and water degradation. Water legislation is increasingly incorporating the requirement to safeguard a water reserve to sustain instream ecology. To address the challenges of increasing food production, improving rural livelihoods, while safeguarding critical ecological functions, a research programme has recently been launched on “Smallholder System Innovations in Integrated Watershed Management” (SSI). The programme takes an integrated approach to agricultural water management, analysing the interactions between the adoption and participatory adaptation of water system innovations (such as water harvesting, drip irrigation, conservation farming, etc.), increased water use in agriculture and water flows to sustain ecological functions that deliver critical ecosystem services to humans. The research is carried out in the Pangani Basin in Tanzania and the Thukela Basin in South Africa. A nested scale approach is adopted, which will enable the analysis of scale interactions between water management at the farm level, and cascading hydrological impacts at watershed and basin scale. This paper describes the integrated research approach of the SSI programme, and indicates areas of potential to upgrade rainfed agriculture in water scarcity-prone agro-ecosystems while securing water for downstream use.

N2  - The current standard diagnostic tests for Schistosoma mansoni are the Kato-Katz and circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) techniques. However, these techniques have been documented to have several limitations that have a direct impact on schistosomiasis control programmes. Therefore, there is a need for more sensitive and specific tests for diagnosing schistosomiasis. This study compared the performance of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Kato-Katz, and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) techniques in the diagnosis of S. mansoni infection in the Mwea irrigation scheme, Kirinyaga County in Central Kenya. We carried out a cross-sectional study on 357 individuals residing in four villages in the Mwea irrigation scheme. The participants provided urine and stool samples which were screened for S. mansoni infections using the three techniques. The prevalence of S. mansoni by each technique was calculated and 95% confidence intervals estimated using binomial regression model. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using 2 × 2 contingency tables and compared using the McNemar’s chi-square test. Positive and negative predictive values were also determined using the weighted generalized score chi-square test for paired data. The study showed that the prevalence of S. mansoni was 32.8%, 62.5% and 72.8% using Kato-Katz, POC-CCA and qPCR techniques, respectively. Further, when using Kato-Katz as a gold standard, POC-CCA sensitivity was 78.6% and specificity was 45.4%, while qPCR sensitivity was 97.4% and specificity was 39.2%. When using qPCR as the gold standard, Kato-Katz sensitivity was 43.8% and specificity was 96.9%, while POC-CCA sensitivity was 78.1% and specificity was 79.4%. Finally, when using the averaged results from the three techniques as the gold standard, the sensitivity was 41.6%, 79.4% and 92.5% for Kato-Katz, POC-CCA and qPCR, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for all techniques. Kato-Katz technique showed low sensitivity compared to the POC-CCA and qPCR despite it being the most commonly preferred method of choice to diagnose S. mansoni infections. qPCR showed superior sensitivity followed by POC-CCA, hence it can be used as an alternative or to confirm the results obtained by the Kato-Katz technique.

N2  - Decades of agricultural growth has led to the over appropriation of Yakima water and the ecological integrity of the Basin has been compromised. We evaluate the impact of current water allocation on the natural flow regime of the Yakima River using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration/Range of Variability Analysis and by quantifying indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit. We analyze the sustainability of the current water allocation scheme based on a range of sustainability criteria, from weak to strong to environmentally sustainable. Economic efficiency is assessed by describing the current allocation framework and suggesting ways to make it more efficient. Our IHA/RVA analysis suggests that the allocation of water in the Yakima River has resulted in a highly altered flow regime. Ecodeficit is far in excess of ecosurplus. We conclude that this allocation scheme is weakly sustainable, if sustainable at all, in its current framework. The allocation of water is also not economically efficient and we suggest that a reallocation of water rights may be necessary in order to achieve this objective. The creation of water markets to stimulate voluntary water rights transactions is the best way to approach economic efficiency. The first step would be to extend beneficial use requirements to include instream flows, which would essentially allow individuals to convert offstream rights into instream rights. The Washington trust water rights program was implemented as a means of creating a water market, which has contributed to the protection of instream flows, however more needs to be done to create an ideal water rights market so that rights migrate to higher valued uses, many of which are met instream. However, water markets will likely not solve the Yakima's water allocation problems alone; some degree of regulation may still be necessary.

N2  - In this study, a hybrid land-water-environment (LWE) model is developed for identifying ecological effect and risk under uncertain precipitation in an agroforestry ecosystem. A simulation-based fuzzy-stochastic programming with risk analysis (SFSR) method is used into LWE model to reflect the meteorological impacts; meanwhile, it also can quantify artificial fuzziness (e.g., risk attitude of policymaker) and natural vagueness (e.g., ecological function) in decision-making. The developed LWE model with SFSR method is applied to a practical agroforestry ecosystem in China. Results of optimized planting scale, irrigative water schedule, pollution mitigation scheme, and system benefit under changed rainfall, precise risk-adoption and vague ecological function are obtained; meanwhile their corresponding ecological effects and risks are analyzed. It found that current LWE plans could generate massive water deficits (e.g., 23.22×106m3 in crop irrigation and 26.32×106m3 in forest protection at highest) due to over-cultivation and excessive pollution discharges (e.g., the highest excessive TP and TN discharges would reach 460.64 and 15.30×103 ton) due to irrational fertilization, which would increase regional ecological risks. In addition, fifteen scenarios associated with withdrawing cultivation and recovering forest based on regional environment heterogeneity (such as soil types) have been discussed to adjust current agriculture-environment policies. It found that, the excessive pollution discharges (TN and TP) could be reduced 12.95% and 18.32% at highest through ecological expansions, which would generate higher system benefits than that without withdrawing farmland and recovering forest. All above can facilitate local policymakers to modulate a comprehensive LWE with more sustainable and robust manners, achieving regional harmony between socio-economy and eco-environment.

N2  - This paper assesses the vulnerability of grape growers and winery operators in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia to climate variability and change, in the context of other sources of risk. Through interviews and focus groups, producers identified the climatic and non-climatic risks relevant to them and the strategies employed to manage these risks. The results show that the presence of multiple exposures affects the way in which producers are vulnerable to climate change. Producers are vulnerable to conditions that not only affect crop yield, but also affect their ability to compete in or sell to the market. Their sensitivity to these conditions is influenced in part by institutional factors such as trade liberalization and a “markup-free delivery” policy. Producers’ ability to adapt or cope with these risks varies depending on such factors as the availability of resources and technology, and access to government programmes. Producers will likely face challenges associated with the supply of water for irrigation due to a combination of climatic changes and changing demographics in the Okanagan Valley, which in turn affect their ability to adapt to climatic conditions. Finally, adaptations made by producers can change the nature of the operation and its vulnerability, demonstrating the dynamic nature of vulnerability.

N1  - SI - Party Politics, the Poor and the City: reflections from South Africa
N2  - Aquatic socio-ecological systems show pervasive cross-scale interactions and problems of fit between ecosystems and institutions. Nested bio-hydrological processes within river basins are prone to third-party impacts, and equitable/sustainable management of water resources requires adequate governance patterns that both cover relevant scalar levels and handle cross-scale interactions. This paper provides the example of the Zayandeh Rud basin, in central Iran, and describes the historical evolution of water use at three different nested scales. It shows how the gradual overallocation of water resources (basin closure) and the manipulation of the hydrological cycle by the state and other actors have resulted in a constant spatial and social redistribution of water use and associated benefits and costs. State-centered modes of governance characterized by the priority to large-scale infrastructure, vested political and financial interests, lack of attention to local processes and hydrological interconnectedness, and the neglect of environmental degradation, must give way to forms of comanagement that better articulate the different levels of control and governance.

N2  - Our research objective was to investigate ways to evaluate landscape water use to help cities more effectively direct water conservation programs to locations with capacity to conserve. Research was conducted in connection with a landscape irrigation evaluation delivered through a city-sponsored Water Check Program. Research efforts led to development of several assessment and monitoring tools including: Landscape Irrigation Ratio (LIR), Participant Outcome Evaluation Tool, and Program Evaluation Tool. We utilized these tools to identify locations with capacity to conserve water applied to landscapes, compare water use before and after the water check, and evaluate Water Check Program effectiveness. We found the LIR approach successfully distinguished residential locations efficiently or acceptably using water applied to landscapes from ones with use considered inefficient or excessive. In analyzing change in participants’ water use and eliminating explanations other than the water check, we found factors influencing landscape water use tend to be highly contextualized and the intervention itself needed to be analyzed. The majority of participants who adopted the water check recommendations successfully reduced their landscape water use, but results indicate water check programs can be designed for greater effectiveness by accommodating participants’ differing knowledge and skill levels. We argue that the tools we developed provide the water conservation field with a needed set of common assessment methods. We conclude that landscape water checks have the potential to provide people with the information and problem-solving skills necessary to maintain residential landscapes using appropriate amounts of water if they are well designed, delivered, and monitored.

N1  - Preparing Rice for a Water-Limited Future: from Molecular to Regional Scale.International Rice Research Congress
N2  - Irrigated crops are increasingly facing water scarcity and other forms of abiotic stress, including the presence of salts and other pollutants in soil and irrigation water, waterlogging and flooding of soils, low pH in acid sulfate soils, and anaerobic and toxic conditions in the rootzone. More progress has been made with the alleviation of some of these stresses than with others. This paper examines why salinity of soil and irrigation water is common and nearly inevitable in the irrigated lands of the semi-arid tropics and subtropics. It considers opportunities for and constraints in making management changes that would increase the productivity of water (i.e., the yield per unit of water diverted from the source or consumed in evapotranspiration) at system and basin level. Success of water management interventions in reducing the impact of abiotic stresses on rice production under saline conditions and on acid soils depends on improved control over the components of the water and ion balances at field and basin level. One of these measures is the installation of drainage systems. The benefits and costs of sub-surface drainage are illustrated by an example from Egypt's Nile Delta. An integrated approach to water resource management is an essential but not sufficient condition to prevent conflicts between different users and consumers of the scare resource.

N2  - Surface water infiltration is an important process to meet plant water needs and an important part of the hydrological cycle via groundwater recharge, with special relevance in semi-arid regions. This study evaluated the relationships between grassland plant root morphological characteristics and soil water infiltration rates (IR: initial, steady and average). For this purpose, five artificial homogeneous grasslands (Melilotus suaveolens, Medicago sativa, Panicum virgatum, Bromus inermis and Miscanthus sinensis) without irrigation or fertilization were studied in the Loess Plateau. The observed steady IR were significantly different between the 1-year grasslands: M. suaveolens > M. sativa > P. virgatum > B. inermis > M. sinensis. The root length density and root surface area were negatively correlated with the average, initial and steady IR at different soil depths (p < 0.05). However, the root volume did not significantly influence IR. The stepwise multiple regression determined that the main factors controlling IR were the root length density at the depth of 5−30 cm and root surface area at the depth of 10−20 cm. Our results provide insight into the influence of grassland root morphological characteristics on water infiltration in drylands and are of interest for soil water supply programs in forage production.

N2  - Annual inputs and isotope compositions of Pb were investigated to assess Pb pollution and source apportionment in a paddy field around a mining and smelting area. The concentrations of Pb in surface soils (0–20 cm) were significantly higher than those in deep soils (20–100 cm) and the mean concentration of Pb in rice grains exceeded the maximum acceptable level of Pb in food (0.20 mg/kg). These observations indicated that soils and rice in the study area were polluted by Pb. Lead input was higher than Pb output. The annual net input flux of Pb was approximately 18.7 mg/m2/year for the study area. Atmospheric deposition was the most predominant input pathway for Pb, accounting for 95.3% of the total Pb input. However, contributions of fertilizer and irrigation water were merely 3.11% and 2.57%, respectively. Lead isotopic signatures in surface soils and rice grains were different from those in possible sources. This difference suggested that Pb in surface soils and rice grains came from multiple sources. The calculation results from IsoSource program showed that geological background, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, and irrigation water contributed between 20–84%, 16–42%, 0–42% and 0–28% to soil Pb, respectively. As for rice grains, 76–98% of Pb was derived from atmospheric deposition, whereas source contribution of soil Pb was only 0–26%. These results indicated that mining and smelting activities posed a higher risk to rice grains than soils. Field monitoring (FM) combined with isotope composition analysis (ICA) can provide more information for source identification of Pb than the separate methods.

N2  - We present two mathematical models that consider the physical and
chemical site-specific management zones within the parcels. Indeed, the
spatial variability of these properties directly impacts the
agricultural production planning. The first model is for the crop
planning problem. At the beginning of the production cycle, it assesses
the chemical and physical management zones to determine the optimal crop
pattern for maximizing the farmer's expected profit. The second model is
a real-time irrigation method that takes the solution of the crop
planning problem as input. Then, at each irrigation period, it considers
the physical management zones and the humidity level of each parcel to
determine in real-time the optimal amount of water for each crop
irrigation. This is especially important in regions where droughts are
frequent. We empirically show that our methodologies are efficient on
instances based on real data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

N2  - In aquifer-dependent regions, balancing aquifer protection, desalination, economic development, agricultural irrigation, and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping. Aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers. Despite its importance, little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown. The novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer. It develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination, the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users, aquifers, and time periods. A mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter Lotikipi Aquifer, discovered in 2013 in northern Kenya using modern remote sensing methods. While initial pumping of the Lotikipi Aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels, interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation. The model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels. Based on that exercise, a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven-year time period. A third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system. Results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of $0.08 - $0.18 USD per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available. While this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places, the future could be more optimistic. Advances in desalination technology, higher crop prices, technical advance in agriculture, and development of drought-resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination.

N2  - This paper evaluates the impact of land reforms on household agricultural investments, livelihood strategies, and income levels in Brazil. Given the persistence of rural poverty in Northeast Brazil and the existence of both land and credit market failures, land reforms remain important policy tools for alleviating poverty and increasing growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the recent National Program of Land Credit, a controversial market-assisted land reform program that provides access to land through private land markets. Household-level panel data covering similar beneficiary and control groups allows for identification using both propensity score weighting and difference-in-difference methodologies. The evidence indicates that the Land Credit successfully transitions households into agriculture, with land holdings and investments increasing as a result of the program. As with many earlier land reform programs in Latin America, the new wave of market-assisted land reforms does not increase access to private credit. While land reforms have the potential to drive redistribution, poverty reduction, and growth, these findings suggest that ensuring greater access to credit, irrigation, and higher return economic activities remains important.

N2  - Predictability of seasonal climate variations associated with ENSO suggests a potential to reduce farm risk by tailoring agricultural management strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions. Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut–cotton–corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El Niño and marginally from La Niña forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP.

N2  - The crop intensification program (CIP) was introduced in Rwanda in 2007
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI), Rwanda,
as a solution to the land fragmentation, low use of agricultural inputs
and low access to extension services. However, due to the voluntary
nature of farmers' participation and their reluctance to participate,
this study aimed at assessing the factors that influence their
participation. Data were collected from 340 respondents through a
household survey in Mayange and Rusarabuye sectors. Descriptive
statistics and binary logistic regression model were used to analyze the
data. Results show that the factors that significantly influenced the
farmers' participation in the CIP include gender, non-farm income,
farmland size, farming experience, land acquisition means, market
access, trust and agro-ecological conditions. In fact, the non-farm
income significantly increased the farmers' decisions to participate in
the CIP (P<0.001) as it eases the financial capital needed to invest in
the CIP activities. On the land acquisition means, the farmers who
inherited or bought the land positively and significantly participated
in the CIP (P<0.05) because they had the land tenure security. However,
the participation in the CIP was hindered by inadequate irrigation and
mechanization facilities, lack of farmers' participation in the CIP
planning process, inadequate extension services, inadequate agricultural
inputs and inadequate post-harvest technologies. Closer collaboration
between farmers, local leaders, extension agents and agricultural
service providers as well as the farmers' practical skills in irrigation
and mechanization could enhance the participation to the program.
Therefore, there is a need on the part of policymakers to empower
farmers with adequate knowledge on better cropping practices and
agricultural technologies through appropriate extension services and
bottom-up based program.

N2  - South Africa's moist grassland harbours globally significant biodiversity, supplies essential ecosystem services, supports crop and livestock agriculture, forestry and settlement, yet is poorly conserved. Ongoing transformation and limited opportunity for expanding the protected area network require instead that biodiversity conservation is ‘mainstreamed’ within other land uses. This exercise sought to identify the relative compatibility of 10 land uses (conservation, livestock or game ranching, tourism/recreation, rural settlement, dryland cropping, irrigated cropping, dairy farming, plantation forestry, and urban settlement) with maintaining biodiversity integrity. This was assessed using 46 indicators for biodiversity integrity that covered landscape composition, structure, and functioning. Data was integrated into a single measure per land use through application of the analytic hierarchy process, with supporting information gained from interviews with experts. The rank order of importance amongst indicators was landscape structure, functioning and composition. Consistent differences among land uses for all three categories revealed two clear groupings. Conservation, livestock or game ranching had the lowest impact and retained substantial natural asset, while that for tourism/recreation was intermediate. All other land uses had a severe impact. Impact on biodiversity integrity depended mainly on the extent of transformation and fragmentation, which accounted for the greatest impact on habitats and species, and impairment of landscape functioning. It is suggested that a strategic intervention for maintaining biodiversity integrity of moist grassland is to support livestock or game ranching and limit ongoing urban sprawl.

N2  - Drought stress really restring the growth and development of tea plant and affecting quality and yield. In tea growing areas of Iran, drought stress is a serious problem that affects the yield and quality of green leaves, therefore introducing cultivars that tolerate drought stress is one of the breeding purpose. To distinguish the variations in four tea cultivars response to drought stress and the role of melatonin in reducing the destructive effects of drought stress, an experiment was done at Tea Research Center of Iran, using the factorial based on completely randomized design with three replicates. The first experimental factor was the cultivar at 4 levels (DG39, DG7, DN and Kashef) and the second factor was irrigation interruption treatment at 5 levels, including control (full irrigation), irrigation interruption for 7 days with 100 µm melatonin foliar application, irrigation interruption for 7 days without melatonin foliar application, irrigation interruption for 14 days with melatonin foliar application and irrigation interruption for 14 days without melatonin foliar application. The study indicated that the physiological and biochemical traits were significantly different among the cultivars and treatments. Based on some traits such as malondialdehyde, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, POD), carotenoid and polyphenol content, DG 39 and based on traits such as proline, total sugar and chlorophyll content, DN are introduced as the cultivars that showed better tolerance to drought stress and these cultivars can be used in future breeding programs. Also melatonin treatment significantly enhanced the drought tolerance of tea seedlings, as demonstrated by decreased membrane damage, raised the concentration of proline, total protein, and total sugar and enhanced the activities of catalase and peroxidase during drought stress.

N2  - A general optimization framework is introduced with the overall goal of reducing search space size and increasing the computational efficiency of evolutionary algorithm application to optimal crop and water allocation. The framework achieves this goal by representing the problem in the form of a decision tree, including dynamic decision variable option (DDVO) adjustment during the optimization process and using ant colony optimization (ACO) as the optimization engine. A case study from literature is considered to evaluate the utility of the framework. The results indicate that the proposed ACO-DDVO approach is able to find better solutions than those previously identified using linear programming. Furthermore, ACO-DDVO consistently outperforms an ACO algorithm using static decision variable options and penalty functions in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. The considerable reduction in computational effort achieved by ACO-DDVO should be a major advantage in the optimization of real-world problems using complex crop simulation models.

N2  - Spate irrigation in the lowlands of Sheeb area in eastern Eritrea enables the farmers to harvest a crop without application of fertilizers. But at the same time, the sediment deposition increases the surface level of spate irrigated fields, which often requires raising the field bunds. This study was conducted (1) to determine the sedimentation rate on spate irrigated fields; (2) to assess the impact of sedimentation on the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils and (3) to recommend possible management interventions. The thickness of deposited sediment layers on the fields was measured using sediment pins. Twenty-seven sediment pins were installed at three plots in Sheeb area on a fine, loamy, calcaric Fluvisol. The plots were located at the upstream, midstream and downstream parts along a main diversion canal. The measured sedimentation rates ranged from 8·3 to 31·6 mm y−1in the upstream plot, from 6·0 to 18·0 mm y−1in the midstream plot and from 5·2 to 8·6 mm y−1in the downstream plot. These rates corresponded with an average sedimentation of 143 tons ha−1in the three plots. The sedimentation has improved the physical and chemical characteristics of spate irrigated soils compared with non-irrigated soils. However, nutrient inputs (such as addition of manure and incorporation of crop residues) may be necessary in the near future to replenish the soil nutrient stocks.

N2  - Countries' water-related programs mainly align with water scarcity and climate change adaptation. However, a central point about the proposed strategies is the effectiveness degree of the introduced measures and their proportionality and coordination with the other goals of the system. This study uses a combination simulation approach using the SWAT model and water footprint accounting framework to investigate water management activities' effects and rebound effects on water resources sustainability. The activities included expanding modern irrigation systems, developing rain-fed orchards, watershed management activities, and omitting water-intensive crops. Results show that although the growth of modern irrigation systems reduced water extraction by 50%, this strategy cannot be helpful in water-saving because the actual water use is not controlled and even caused a slight increase in water consumption of 0.6%. This measure also led to a significant reduction in return flow to the aquifer (80%). Results also indicate an intensification of blue water non-sustainability caused by the expansion of rain-fed orchards because of increased actual water use. Watershed management activities raise green water storage by 4%, positively impacting aquifer recharge, which is in line with the objectives of the water sector. However, it cannot be used as an effective strategy to create new water resources to deal with environmental crises such as wetlands restoration. Changing the water-intensive cropping pattern will effectively improve blue water and groundwater sustainability if the rebound effects are controlled. Thus, there will be a water saving of approximately 110 million m3 in water consumption with the alteration of rice cultivation into wheat in the studied basin.

N2  - Water, energy, and food (WEF) are interlinked and create a dynamic system that impacts both human well-being and ecology. Given the importance of ecology within the WEF system, water resources serve as the core issue. The allocation of water resources in irrigation districts is a challenging problem for the coordinated development of agricultural production, water resources, and the ecological environment. The integration of stochastic multi-objective programming, fuzzy credibility-constrained programming, and mixed integer programming offers a solution to this issue, with the construction of a fuzzy credibility-constrained stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The applicability and validity of this model were verified by applying it to the Kaikong Irrigation District (KID) of the Tarim River Basin in northwest China, with notable findings indicating that the optimized system reduces agricultural costs by 5.82%, increases irrigation water use efficiency by 1.80%, and reduces global warming potential by 6.45%. This study investigates the effects of diverse allocation strategies of water and land resources on the social, economic, and ecological subsystems and their interactions by downscaling four subprocesses PBs to the KID scale. The optimization model reveals that only the nitrogen footprint of Kuerle City surpasses the nitrogen boundary of the KID. The proposed solutions based on the model can encourage the green and ecologically-friendly development of agricultural production and can be applied to agricultural systems in arid regions with similar conditions.

N2  - Credit constraint is often considered as one of the key barriers to the adoption of modern agricultural technologies and low agricultural productivity in low- and middle-income countries. Past research and much of the policy discourse associate agricultural credit constraints with supply-side factors, such as limited access to credit sources or high costs of borrowing. However, demand-side factors, such as risk-aversion and financial illiteracy among borrowers could also affect credit-rationing of smallholder agricultural households. This study investigates the nature of credit constraints, factors affecting credit constraint status, and the effects of credit constraints on adoption and intensity of use of three modern agricultural technologies – small-scale irrigation, chemical fertilizer, and improved seeds. The paper also assesses whether credit constraints are gender-differentiated. Primary survey data were collected from sample farmers in Ethiopia and Tanzania, and Tobit and two-step hurdle econometric models were used to analyze these data. Results show that demand-side credit constraints are as important as supply-side factors in conditioning smallholders’ access to credit in both countries. We also find that credit is a binding constraint for the decision to adopt technologies and input use intensity in Tanzania but not statistically significant in Ethiopia. Results suggest that women are more likely to be credit constrained (from both the supply and demand sides) than men in both study countries. Based on these findings, we suggest that policies should focus on addressing both supply- and demand-side credit constraints to credit access, including through targeted interventions to reduce risk, such as crop insurance, and to strengthen the gender sensitivity of credit policies. © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  - Throughout Australia, there is concern that land use change is mobilizing salt stored in the landscape, causing salinity in soil and water resources. Salt in the landscape becomes a salinity risk only if it is mobilized by groundwater movement. A combination of modelled groundwater behaviour under various land uses with three-dimensional salt-load maps developed from airborne electromagnetic survey (AEM) provides a practical tool to assess potential salt movement. AEM survey of the country around St. George, SE Queensland, revealed a potential salinity threat: significant salt stores in the uplands adjacent to flood plains which support important irrigation developments and which drain to the Darling River system. A conceptual model of the regional hydrogeology was built upon three-dimensional AEM data, an investigation-drilling program, and direct field measurement of hydraulic conductivities. This information was incorporated in a Flowtube groundwater model and groundwater responses to five different land management options were tested over a 100-year period. Surface water storage on relatively permeable soils and continuous irrigated cotton both resulted in water tables reaching the soil surface; rain-fed wheat and pasture both resulted in a raised watertable, but both established a new equilibrium without the water table reaching the ground surface.

N2  - European water policy, as set out in the Water Framework Directive (WFD), requires all EU Member States to implement volumetric water pricing at rates that roughly cover the total costs of providing water services. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that, for the different types of farm in an irrigable area, will enable us to analyse the differential impact that a pricing policy for irrigation water would have. For this purpose, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) mathematical programming models were used. The methodology is implemented on a representative area in the Duero Valley in Spain. Our results show the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of a water pricing policy. This allows significant differences in the evolution of agricultural incomes to be observed, as well as the recovery of costs by the State, demand for agricultural employment and the consumption of agrochemicals resulting from rising prices of irrigation water in various groups of farmers within a given irrigated area.

N2  - This paper firstly analyzes the land use - land cover (LULC) in Lake Ziway watershed (Ethiopia) and quantifies the changing patterns from 1973 to 2014 using Landsat images. Secondly, the paper estimates sediment yields using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model). It also assesses and estimates water abstraction from Lake Ziway using survey data. The study shows that the conversions from woodlands into agricultural lands and settlement areas are the major detected LULC changes. Of the total area of the watershed, agricultural lands and settlement areas together increased from 57% in 1973 to 75% in 2014 at the expense of woodlands whose areas decreased from 26.16% to 6.63% in the study periods. The study also shows that water abstraction and sediment loads are increasing at Lake Ziway watershed. The major driving forces behind these LULC changes and the impacts on the lake natural condition are anthropogenic factors such as population growth, land policy changes and deforestation. Increasing demands for more land and water resources, i.e., land for settlements and cultivation, wood for fuel and charcoals, and water for irrigation and municipal water supply, are the underlying causes for the observed changes on the watershed resources. Thus, if the existing scenarios of human pressures are left neglected without management interventions, severe watershed degradations will continue to further affect the watershed's resources including the hydrology. Therefore, responsible government institutions should start mobilizing the local communities along with providing financial and material supports for watershed rehabilitation through afforestation and soil and water conservation activities. Additionally, the free-access practices for water use should be replaced by user-charge policy to regulate water abstractions in order to adequately sustain the water level of Lake Ziway and its feeder rivers. In this respect, this study provides firsthand information to policy makers and planners to put in place a comprehensive land and water use plan and regulations against the unruly human actions in the watershed before irreversible losses might happen to Lake Ziway and its watershed resources.

N2  - Both rising competition for water resources and increasing environmental concerns have placed the need for an enhanced water resources management on the policy agenda. However, a stricter regulation of irrigation water tends to result in declining farm income and arising risk exposure. With this in mind, we investigate the potential of index-based weather insurance, which is also referred to as weather derivatives, to cope with the economic disadvantages for farmers resulting from a reduction in water quotas and increased water prices. By means of a whole-farm risk programming approach, we systematically compare crop portfolios without and with the possibility of purchasing standardized weather derivatives based on precipitation and temperature indices. In an application to a representative cash crop farm in the northeastern part of the German federal state of Lower Saxony, we found that the use of weather derivatives offsets the loss in farmers’ certainty equivalent resulting from moderate reductions in water quotas and water price increases. Our results also indicate that the provision of weather derivatives may substantially alter farm plans as well as the optimal irrigation water demand.

N2  - The present study focuses on (i) evaluation of potato crop yield under present time slice (PTS) with recommended management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation on sandy soils of Minnesota, USA (ii) simulation of potato productivity and nitrate leaching with the SUBSTOR DSSAT-potato model in a projected future climatic environment (2038–2067) and (iii) evaluation of alternative irrigation and N management strategies with the DSSAT model as adaptation measures to minimize climate change impacts. Ensemble global climate model output for each of three future mid-century (MC) 10-years time slices of crop growing season predicts increases in maximum temperature (Tmax) of 0.7, 1.2 and 2.1°C; and in minimum temperature (Tmin) of 0.6, 1.3 and 2.0°C in MC1 (2038–2047), MC2 (2048–2057) and MC3 (2058–2067), respectively, during the tuber bulking periods. Rainfall (RF) of 253.1mm in PTS decreased by 29.7, 16.7 and 6.5mm in MC1–MC3, respectively. Under the changed climate, simulations indicated decreases in potato yields of 19–29%, harvest index of 4–9% and water use efficiency of 22–32% compared with current irrigation and fertilizer rates (260mm irrigation, 270kgha−1 N fertilizer). Potato yields could be sustained at present levels by increasing irrigation levels to 390mm, with 450kgha−1 N in the years 2038–2047; and 326 and 390mm irrigation with 450kgNha−1 in year 2048–2057. However, leaching losses in 2048–2057 would increase (relative to current losses) by 34–62%. In the years 2058–2067 yield in the region evaluated can no longer be sustained with increased N and irrigation levels and leaching losses would increase by 41–67%. Use of varieties tolerant to drought and heat or adapting alternative cultural practices will be required to maintain productivity.

N2  - The optimal allocation of agricultural water rights is of great importance in promoting the efficient management of water resources in irrigation areas. In the process of agricultural water rights allocation, problems develop when the dynamics and uncertainties caused by changes in water cycle elements are ignored. To balance socioeconomic development and environmental protection, this study develops a model framework for evaluating and optimizing the synergistic management of agricultural water rights allocation trading under multiple uncertainties (AWRAS-TCME). The model is capable of reflecting the dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall, evapotranspiration and runoff and quantitatively measures the synergistic effect of multidimensional objectives of the economy-society-resources-environment on water rights allocations and transactions. The AWRAS-TCME model integrates a two-level multiobjective nonlinear programming model and a projection tracking model into a framework to measure the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation based on an analysis of the sustainability of water rights prices in multiple dimensions, fully considering the influence of uncertainties in hydrological and social systems. The model was applied to an actual irrigation area, and the results showed that (1) total optimized water rights allocation was reduced by 4.7–20.9% at different levels of water supply and demand; (2) the total volume of water rights transfer among regions was increased by 4.8%−12.9%, and the trading volume of the water rights market was increased to account for 5%−16.2% of the total revenue; and (3) the optimal net income of water rights allocation was increased by 1.2%−3.3%, and the equity of water rights allocation was increased by 0.06–0.09. The developed model promotes the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigated areas.

N2  - The rice stem nematode Ditylenchus angustus causes “Ufra” disease in rice resulting in substantial yield losses. Although it is predominant in deep water rice in South and Southeast Asia, this nematode also infects irrigated and rainfed low land rice. This study evaluated rice genotypes (irrigated, rainfed, deep water and landraces) for resistance to the Bangladeshi population of D. angustus. The experiment was executed using artificial inoculation, in both rainfed and irrigated ecosystems. The rice varieties were first scored at 28 days post inoculation (dpi), and ranked based on the postinfectional reactions and severity of symptoms on a 0–16 rating scale. The susceptibility of the varieties was also evaluated at a later time point, i.e. 55 dpi, based on the percentage of tiller infections, using a disease index scoring system ranging from 0 to 9. Both screening methods showed a similar ranking of the varieties for susceptibility/resistance against this nematode. The experiment was initially conducted in plastic pots, and the promising varieties were analyzed further in field conditions. Out of the 85 varieties, one landrace named ‘Manikpukha’ proved to be highly resistant, while 6 other varieties showed resistance and 13 varieties showed moderately resistant responses under both pot and field conditions. The promising varieties found in the present investigation can be used in rice breeding programs as well as for further detailed studies to develop a sustainable ufra management strategy.

N2  - Rice (Oryza spp.) is the major staple food for most countries in West Africa, but local production does not meet demand. Rice is grown mainly by smallholder farmers, and yields are generally low with high temporal and spatial variability. Low yields have been attributed to unfavorable climate conditions, poor soil quality, and sub-optimum agricultural practices. The objectives of this study were to assess variation in yields of three major rice production systems (irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and upland) across three climatic zones (semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid), and identify factors affecting that variation. We analyzed data on yield, climate, soil, and agricultural practices for 1305 farmers’ fields at 22 sites in 11 West African countries between 2012 and 2014. A boundary function approach was used to determine attainable yields. Random forest algorithm was used to identify factors responsible for yield variation. Average rice yield was 4.1, 2.0, and 1.5tha−1 in irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland systems, respectively, with maximum attainable yields of 8.3, 6.5, and 4.0tha−1. Yield difference between attainable and average yield tended to be higher in irrigated and rainfed lowland systems. In those two systems, yields were highest in the semi-arid zone, while no difference in yields among climatic zones was apparent for upland rice. High rice yields were associated with high solar radiation, high maximum temperature, intermediate air humidity, multiple split nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications, high frequency of weeding operations, the use of certified seeds, and well-leveled fields in the irrigated lowland system. Minimum temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, construction of field bunds, varietal choice, and the frequency of weeding operations were determinants of rice yield variation in the rainfed lowland system. Varietal choice, bird control, and frequency of weeding operations affected rice yields in the upland system. Improving access to inputs, improving input use efficiencies, and site-specific management strategies are recommended as priority interventions to boost rice yields at regional scale independent of production system and climatic zone.

N2  - Increasing the productivity of available water resources is central to producing more food, fighting poverty, reducing competition for water, and ensuring that there is enough water for the environment. For sustainable water resources management, a better understanding of the link between productivity changes and their impact on different users within the same basin is required. Therefore it is imperative to develop common water accounting procedures for analyzing the use, depletion, and productivity of water at the plant, field, irrigation system, and basin scales. This chapter emphasizes the need for measuring water productivity at different scales because different actions are needed to enhance water productivity at each level. The chapter also provides a discussion on potential interventions and strategies that can be used to enhance productivity of water at different scales. Successful implementation of these interventions requires more detailed technical and economic analysis to ensure sustainability.

N2  - Understanding the relation between land use and groundwater recharge is of direct interest in areas that are prone to geohazards. This study was performed to characterize the effects of land use on groundwater table (GWT) distribution in the Heifangtai (HFT) loess terrace under long-term flood irrigation, as irrigation intensity was governed by the crop types. In light of the regional temperature-vegetable dryness index (TVDI) and optical images obtained in different seasons over four years, the dataset incorporated the growth cycles of the local crops, which in turn improved the workload and accuracy of land use detection. Irrigation intensities for different crops were recorded during field investigations. A total of 26 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles were conducted to estimate the GWT distribution of HFT terrace, which was further utilized to reveal the relation between land use (i.e. irrigation) and GWT fluctuations. The results indicated that high local GWT was associated with vegetable fields which had the highest irrigation intensity, and by contrast, low local GWT was attributed to the perennial fruit tree fields with the lowest irrigation intensity. The discharge was monitored intermittently for over three years to analyze the effect on the local GWT close to margin of HFT. The result showed a strong correlation between spring discharge and GWT fluctuations along the margin of HFT, indicating that groundwater recharge was affected by both irrigation and spring discharges. These results suggested that incorporating growth cycles of crops can effectively facilitate the interpretation of remote sensing data for land use detection, and the results can provide useful guidance for improving irrigation programs and for alleviating geohazards in regions that are under long-term irrigation.

N2  - Publisher Summary
Olives and olive products contain a diversified array of phenolic compounds with important biological properties and positive health effects on humans. An effort is necessary to minimize the loss of phenolic compounds in olives and their derived products. Various factors, from intrinsic to agronomic, affect phenolic compounds. Olive cultivars, together with geographical origin, are responsible for the typicality of olives, table olives, and olive oils. A most accurate optimum harvest period needs to be estimated according to the olive cultivar and the type of olive product to be produced to reduce the impact of ripening on olives' phenolic composition. Attention has to be paid to agricultural practices and cultivation systems. The introduction of irrigation systems in olive orchards considerably reduces phenolic compounds in olives and olive oil. Over fertilization of olive orchards must be avoided because it may contradict its initial intention—the improvement of olive production and oil yield—and may result in a reduction of phenolic compounds in olives and derived products. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the real needs of the olive tree and apply correct amounts of water and mineral nutrients without considerably influencing the amounts of phytochemicals present. Proper control programs, preferably biological control programs, need to be implemented in olive orchards to control olive pests and disease dissemination. All these factors, in an isolated way or in conjunction, greatly influence olives, table olives, and olive oil phenolic composition. Without a proper control of these factors, the availability of phenolic compounds in olive products will be reduced drastically, with serious adverse effects on in the quality, stability, sensory characteristics, and favorable health properties of the oil.

N2  - Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit-2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers' participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community.

N2  - The Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS), in Central China, has drawn attention internationally because it managed to sustain its rice production in the face of a dramatic reallocation of water to cities, industries and hydropower uses. Ponds, the small reservoirs ubiquitous in the area, are hypothesized to have been instrumental in this. Ponds are recharged by a combination of return flows from irrigation and runoff from catchment areas within the irrigated perimeter. They provide a flexible, local source of irrigation water to farmers. This paper assesses the storage capacity and some key hydrological properties of ponds in a major canal command within ZIS. Using remote sensing data (Landsat and IKONOS) and an area–volume relationship based on a field survey, we obtained an overall pond storage capacity of 96mm (per unit irrigated area). A comparative analysis between 1978 and 2001 reveals that part of this capacity results from a very significant development of ponds (particularly in the smaller range of sizes) in the time interval, probably as a response to rapidly declining canal supplies. We developed a high-resolution digital elevation model from 1:10,000 topographic maps to support a GIS-based hydrological analysis. Pond catchments were delineated and found to extensively overlap, forming hydrological cascades of up to 15 units. In a 76-km2 area within the irrigation system, we found an average of close to five ‘connected’ ponds downstream of each irrigated pixel. This high level of connectivity provides opportunities for multiple reuses of water as it flows along toposequences. A fundamental implication is that field ‘losses’ such as seepage and percolation do not necessarily represent losses at a larger scale. Such scale effects need to be adequately taken into account to avoid making wrong assumptions about water-saving interventions in irrigation.

N2  - Lakes in arid regions are ecologically valuable yet highly fragile due to intense evaporation. To provide an extra water supply for maintaining water balance in lakes, the Ecological Replenishment Water Program (ERWP) in northwest China has significantly changed the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions for these lakes. Descriptive statistics and water and mass balances, together with hydrogeochemical modeling were used in this study to gain an understanding of the impacts of water replenishment (irrigation and drainage water) on evolution for Shahu Lake. A virtual sample was introduced in NETPATH hydrogeochemical modeling to compute the net chemical reactions in the lake water. Variations in TDS indicated that the lake evolved to be saline during 2004–2012 (stage I) and then tended to be fresh during 2013–2014 (stage II). Results highlighted that groundwater outflow and chemical reactions were the overriding factors controlling chemical evolution in the lake system, which greatly depend on the replenishment activities. The salinity reduction from the virtual samples to the final samples were attributed to the precipitation of calcite and dolomite, dissolution of gypsum, Na-K and Na-Ca exchange, and the CO2 degassing in the lake system at an annual scale of 0.11 g/L in stage I and 0.15 g/L in stage II. The quality of replenishment water was as important as quantity for rehabilitating lakes, as it significantly determines the occurrence of chemical reactions in lake water. Findings from this paper can provide insight into the evolution of arid lakes in response to replenishment activities and can help contribute to better management of a valuable and fragile resource.

N2  - Israel's wastewater recycling program is unprecedented internationally, with close to 80% of sewage treated and reused in agriculture. This article presents findings from a national survey of Israel's wastewater reservoir network. Israel's extensive reuse of wastewater is possible due to a national network of reservoirs that has been established in recent years. Sixty effluent reservoirs presently operating in all parts of Israel, were reviewed and evaluated for static data and sampled for water quality analysis during the intensive irrigation season of 2008. The measurement of 16 chemical, physical and biological parameters, along with 21 major and trace elements was carried out, revealing a wide range of concentrations that reflect reservoir physical and operational characteristics. Results indicate that 65% and 78% of the supplied wastewater volume met the old 20 mg/L BOD and 30 mg/L TSS regulations for unlimited irrigation. With reference to Israel's updated, more stringent, regulations, only 22% and 28% of the supplied wastewater volume met the new TSS and E.C. regulations for unlimited irrigation, respectively, and only 48%, 58%, 58% and 62% met the new BOD, fecal coliforms, chloride and sodium regulations for unlimited new irrigation, respectively. All measured major and trace elements were well under existing standards, although there were considerable regional variation. Both principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used to examine how the wastewater quality relates to multiple static construction features and operational parameters of the studied reservoirs. Sewage treatment plant technology, along with the reservoir operational regime, were found to have the greatest influence on the organic, nutrient and suspended solids loads of the wastewater supplied. The geographic location of the reservoirs along with their designed area to volume ratio, were found to have the largest influence over salinity components loads. Careful consideration should be given to the aforementioned features in future the reservoir planning process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Designed as a watershed groundwater restoration policy (WGRP), the Comprehensive Treatment Program of the Shiyang River Basin (CTSRB) was launched in 2006 to restore the groundwater resources in the Minqin oasis, northwestern China. This study sought to verify the recovery effects of CTSRB implementation from the perspective of groundwater depth. We reconstructed the spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater depth at interannual and pixel scales by using digital groundwater depth models (DGDMs), based on the ordinary kriging interpolation method. Using DGDMs data, various measures of the groundwater table (e.g., regional depths, surface areas, depletion cones, and conditions in irrigated regions including Ba, Quanshan, and Hu) were quantitatively analyzed and compared for the pre-CTSRB (2001–2006), CTSRB I (2006–2010), and CTSRB II (2010–2015) periods, for which spatial trends in the annual amplitudes of groundwater depth were compared. Finally, strategies that impacted the groundwater behavior before and during the CTSRB periods, possible indirect and adverse effects, and long-term strategies and prospects were discussed. The results showed that groundwater depth first declined sharply, before increasing slowly and stabilizing after implementation of the CTSRB. Areas of greater groundwater depth (<−20m) and four groundwater depletion cones expanded during the pre-CTSRB period, whereas variable shrinking trends were detected during the CTSRB period. Spatial analysis showed that groundwater recovery mainly occurred along the periphery of the three irrigated regions, among which recovery effects in Hu were more obvious than those in Quanshan and Ba, with pumping-well densities the main reason for the difference. Therefore, various strategies (increasing the surface water supply, reducing groundwater mining, and some other auxiliary measures) of CTSRB together supported groundwater recovery in the Minqin oasis. Overall, this research demonstrates an innovative perspective to verify the effects of WGRPs in arid and semi-arid areas.

N1  - Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries
N2  - Marketing several environmental services from a single area can help access diverse sources of funding and make conservation a more competitive land use. In Bolivia's Los Negros valley (Department of Santa Cruz), bordering the Amboró National Park, 46 farmers are currently paid to protect 2774 ha of a watershed containing the threatened cloud-forest habitat of 11 species of migratory birds. In this payment for environmental services (PES) scheme, annual contracts prohibit tree cutting, hunting and forest clearing on enrolled lands. Farmer–landowners as service providers submit to independent yearly monitoring, and are sanctioned for non-compliance. Facilitated by a local NGO, Fundación Natura Bolivia, one service buyer is an international conservation donor (the US Fish and Wildlife Service) interested in biodiversity conservation. The second service users are downstream irrigators who likely benefit from stabilized dry-season water flows if upstream cloud forests are successfully protected. Individual irrigators have been reluctant to pay, but the Los Negros municipal government has on their behalf contributed ~US$4500 to the scheme. The negotiated payment mode is annual quid pro quo in-kind compensations in return for forest protection. Predominantly, payments are made as “contingent project implementation”, transferring beehives supplemented by apicultural training. With regard to service provision, environment committees and education programs have increased awareness in downstream communities of the probable water-supply reduction effect of continued upstream deforestation. External donors have funded subsequent studies providing basic economic, hydrological and biodiversity data, and covered PES start-up (~US$40,000) and running transaction costs (~US$3000 per year over the last three years). The greatest challenges in the development of the PES mechanism have been the slow process of building trust between service buyers and providers, and in achieving clear service-provision additionality.

N2  - CONTEXT: Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable geological macronutrient that
plays an essential role in food se-curity. The excessive use of P as a
fertilizer and its subsequent diffuse loss leads to the deterioration of
water quality, eutrophication, and loss of biodiversity. Ecosystem
process-based models are a powerful tool to depict the P cycle,
investigate the effects of management practices and climate change, and
ultimately assess policy interventions that affect biogeochemical
cycles. Of the limited number of P models in agricultural production
systems, none have been tested in temperate conditions for periods of
decades using long-term field experiments.OBJECTIVE: The objective of
this study is to evaluate the ability of the detailed P submodel from
DayCent to: simulate the magnitude and temporal dynamics of P outputs;
assess changes in P soil pools from European agricultural long-term
experiments; and interpret the main causal factors inducing the
differences between the observed vs. the simulated pools and
fluxes.METHODS: We used data from four long-term experiments to
calibrate and test the P submodel of DayCent. The experiments involve
five different soils, mineral and organic fertilizer treatments,
management intensity levels, various crop rotations, crop residue
management, and irrigation.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The DayCent model
captured the gross P budget (input minus output) in the four long-term
experiments, and it performed well in simulating their soil total P
(PTotal) over time. The model application simulated the soil available P
(PAvailable) in the same range as the measured data, but the temporal
dynamic did not always match the observed trends. P modelling is subject
to a wide range of uncertainties with respect to both input data
(particularly the unknown initial distribution of the different pool
sizes of P and the uncertainty of the measurements) and the
representation of processes influencing the P cycle that are not yet
accounted for in the model. Despite these uncertainties and calls for
further model assessment and developments, the results show that DayCent
was capable of satisfactorily predicting the main P fluxes over time
under a wide variety of management practices and European site
conditions.SIGNIFICANCE: The model may be used to assess different
scenarios with a changing climate, a change in management or land-use,
and to analyse potential feedback between the terrestrial and the
climate system. This makes this model a promising tool for assessing
policy and practical interventions.

N1  - Agricultural water and nonpoint source pollution management at a watershed scale: PART I Overseen by: Brent Clothier
N2  - Considering global water scarcity, especially in the agricultural sector, many attempts are being made to improve water productivity and save more water. Changing irrigation systems from surface to pressurized has been one of the considerable actions in this regard. However, any attempts to do so must be evaluated in an integrated perspective at the basin level by means of relevant agro-hydrological models before making them operational. This paper aims to address this issue by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Zarrineh Rud River, the main feeding river of northwest Iran’s Lake Urmia, is selected as the case study for exploring this methodology. This lake has been shrinking since 1995, and to save water and increase the basin’s water productivity, improvement of pressurized systems is considered as a solution. SWAT cannot directly simulate changing the irrigation system from surface to pressurized. In this study, we use the innovative approach of applying the model to simulate different irrigation systems considering real irrigation management variables such as depth and date of each irrigation event. Also, in order to improve its performance in simulation of such systems, a comprehensive calibration procedure was used based on a wide range of data for hydrological and agricultural variables. The results showed that changing the current irrigation to a pressurized system can increase water productivity up to 15% due to increases in crop yield, better water distribution and greater actual evapotranspiration. However, pressurized irrigation results in no significant change in total inflow to the lake. Notably, these systems can intensify drawdown of the basin’s water table up to 20%. So, any significant “real water saving” program in the basin must be associated with reduction of evapotranspiration by adopting measures like reducing cultivated areas, changing cropping patterns to less water consuming plants, or applying deficit irrigation. The applied methodology of this paper as well as the comprehensive calibration and setup of the SWAT model with the readily available hydrological and agricultural variables can be a good sample for similar works. However, further work is still needed to more broadly test this approach in areas with intensive irrigation systems.

N2  - Malta faces a raft of water challenges which are negatively impacting on the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, and creating serious tensions with other sectors competing for water, including urban development, tourism and the environment. In this paper we argue for a transparent process centred on participatory stakeholder engagement to agree on the most challenging water-related risks and to identify solutions that both support the water governance framework and improve on-farm water management practices. Given Malta’s dependence on freshwater, this study focused on outdoor field-scale irrigated production. A three staged stakeholder-driven approach was developed. The first stage included Delphi analyses to identify the key constraints on water management and fuzzy cognitive mapping to enable stakeholders to analyse their mental models and formalise conceptual and causal relationships between different components impacting on Maltese agriculture. Secondly, questionnaires were used to inform understanding of national policy gaps in water management and thirdly, a “backcasting” stakeholder workshop was used to identify policy actions to achieve a more sustainable future for agriculture on the island. The study confirmed that Malta’s core challenge is tied to poor water governance and the need to define policies that are socially and environmentally acceptable and geared to tackling the complex water challenges the agricultural sector faces. Developing support for farmer training, knowledge translation, greater public awareness of the importance and value of water for high-value crop production and multi-sector collaboration to promote shared opportunities for water infrastructure investment were highlighted as potential solutions. The findings have direct relevance to other island communities where water scarcity poses serious agronomic risks to production and where agriculture underpins rural livelihoods and the economy.

N2  - The aim of this cradle-to-farm-gate LCA study is the comparison of the impacts generated by different modes of cultivation of beans in the Prespa National Park in Greece. More specifically, three different bean varieties have been assessed based on three different cultivation practices: conventional, integrated and organic. Moreover, the cultivation practices of the three bean varieties are compared based on two different functional units, namely a mass and an area unit. The bean cultivation inventory is compiled from raw agricultural data for the year 2008, extracted from multiple producers involved in a pilot labelling programme. Impact assessment was performed using the CML baseline 2000 method. The results of our analysis indicate that the high input high yield bean varieties are environmentally preferable if we base our assessment on a mass-based functional unit, while the lower input lower yielding variety is preferable if we base our assessment on land use. The integrated agricultural practice is the preferable among the three, in terms of the regional acidification and eutrophication impacts and the global warming potential. On the other hand, organic cultivation of beans leads to protection of the global abiotic resources. Electricity required for irrigation is the major input that affects the environmental impacts followed by the application of sheep manure.

N2  - Climate change has drastic impacts on water resources and agricultural productivity, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The present study simulated and explored the economic impacts of climate change on the water and agriculture sectors of the Zayandehroud river basin in Iran for the years 2040 and 2070in three major phases. In phase I, two general circulation models (GCM) (HadCM2 and CGCM3T63), an artificial neural network (ANN) rainfall-runoff model, and crop-water production functions were applied to evaluate the biophysical impacts of climate change on water resources and various crop yields. In Phase II, the aforementioned models were integrated into the hydro-economic spatial equilibrium model of Zayandehroud basin (HE-SEMZ), and the effects of the modeled runoff and socio-economics changes on the economic welfare of the water sector, its distributional consequences, and on temporal-spatial water prices and allocation were simulated. In Phase III, the simulated optimal allocated water to the agriculture sector was introduced into a positive mathematical programming (PMP) model of the agriculture sector to simulate follow-on changes in crop acreage, cropping patterns, and farmers’ gross benefit. In this modeling framework, the role of two no-cost adaptation strategies in agriculture, i.e. modifications in crop irrigation and cropping pattern, were also investigated. The results showed that by mid-century, precipitation will be reduced and temperature increased in the Zayandehroud river basin. The direct result of these changes will be a reduction in the basin discharge by 4.3 % in 2040 and 8.1 % in 2070 compared to the base period. The simulated economic value of water showed upward trends under climate change and socio-economic scenarios, reflecting an increase in water scarcity. In response to changes in the scarcity value of water, users respond by changing their patterns of water use and allocation. The withdrawal by each sector decreases in response to reduced runoff, although agriculture will be more responsive. The results of the PMP model showed that by choosing optimal cropping pattern and an optimum deficient-irrigation strategy for each crop, there will be good opportunities for farmers to adapt to increasing water scarcity and higher temperatures induced by climate change.

N2  - As a water-saving cultivation technique, the ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RF) system has been a popular planting strategy and has been generally promoted to raise crop yields. However, the effect of the RF system on the susceptibility of maize to lodging is inconclusive. A two-year field experiment, with three planting practices (FP: rain-fed flat planting, TI: traditional irrigation planting and RF) in coupled with two nitrogen (N) application rates (225 and 75 kg N ha−1) and two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars (Zhengnong9 and Zhengdan958), was established to evaluate the risk of lodging under RF and identify how the RF system affects maize lodging. The results revealed that lodging susceptibility had a significantly positive relationship with grain yield (r (coefficient of correlation between lodging rate and grain yield) = 0.36* and 0.79** in 2013 and 2014, respectively), and our previous studies have showed that the maize yield of RF system was significantly higher than the FP practice, suggesting that the RF system increased the lodging risk of maize compared to the FP practice. However, compared with TI, RF decreased plant height, length and centre of gravity height of the basal third internode and improved the stalk bending resistance strength of the basal third internode, leading to significantly increase in the stalk lodging resistance index and reductions in the lodging rate with a simlar grain yield. In summary, RF strategy can be as a hopeful system for summer maize cuiltivation in dry semi-humid areas. High N application rates decreased lodging rate regardless of the plant pattern or cultivar in two years. The lodging rate of Zhengdan958 was significantly higher than that of Zhengnong9. The redundancy analysis showed that plant height, length and stalk bending resistance strength of the basal third internode and centre of gravity height were the vital factors that affected maize lodging, explaining more than 70 % of the total variation in the lodging rate. The plant height, length of the basal third internode and centre of gravity height revealed remarkable positive corrlations with the lodging rate; in addition, the stalk bending resistance strength of the basal third internode revealed remarkable negative corrlation with the lodging rate over the two years. These relationships suggest that increasing stalk strength and decreasing centre of gravity height and plant height result in higher lodging resistance and should be considered in future maize breeding programmes.

N2  - Understanding the field soil water regime is fundamental in scheduling irrigation as well as for monitoring water flow and solute transport. This study was carried out on variable interval irrigation and used time series analysis techniques to predict the soil water content at the interested depth by measuring one single depth in order to precisely determine the next irrigation time and its effect on soil water content at the interested depth. Volumetric water content of silty loam soil in Barcelona was measured in situ with capacitance soil moisture sensors at five depths within the root zone for a horticultural crop during its life cycle in 2010. The time series consisted of hourly measurements of soil water content and was transformed to a stationary situation. Subsequently, the transformed data were used to conduct analyses in the time domain in order to obtain the parameters of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. In the case of variable interval irrigation, predicting the soil water content time series cannot be properly explained by the ARIMA model and its underlying normality assumption. By completing the ARIMA model with intervention analysis and outlier detection, the prediction of soil water content in variable interval irrigation can be made. The transfer function models were then used to predict water contents at depths of interest (0.20, 0.35, 0.50 and 0.60m depths) as well as the average water content WAVG in the top 0.60m soil profile by measuring water content at 0.10m depth. As a result, the predictions were logical. Also, the next irrigation time and its effect on soil water content at the depth of interest were correctly estimated. To confirm results of the models, the experiment was repeated in 2011, and the predicted and observed values agree reasonably well.

N2  - The environmental impact of irrigated agriculture on water quality was assessed in Landazuria watershed (Navarre, northeast Spain), a 479.5ha watershed with 53% of irrigated agricultural land. In the framework of a long-term monitoring program, precipitation and discharge were measured at 10-min intervals and compound daily water samples were collected during the agricultural years (September to August) 2007–2016, and analysed for nitrate (NO3−), phosphate (PO43−), sediment and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. Typical agricultural management (including crop surfaces, irrigation and fertilization rates) was obtained from inquiries to farmers. Concentration and yield of the studied variables presented a high degree of variation, both intra- and inter-annual. Median concentration for the entire study period were 185, <0.05, 31 and 2284mgL−1 for NO3−, PO43−, sediment and TDS, respectively. NO3−-N and PO43−-P yields averaged 74 and 0.04kgha−1year−1, respectively. NO3−-N yield was higher than in other agricultural land uses in Navarre and in the order of magnitude of other irrigated areas in the Middle Ebro Valley. PO43−-P yield was in the same order of magnitude than in rainfed watersheds in Navarre but lower than in intensively grazed watersheds. Sediment yield was extremely variable, averaging 360kgha−1year−1, with 44% of the total measured load recorded in a few days. It was in the lower range of those measured in Navarre for rainfed agriculture and similar to those estimated in other irrigated areas of the Middle Ebro River. TDS concentration presented a significant decreasing trend since available salts were being washed out, while TDS yield averaged 1.8Mgha−1year−1. Long-term monitoring of irrigated areas is required to understand pollution processes in these agroecosystems and to adequately characterize the environmental impact of current agricultural practices on water quality, in order to implement, and adequately assess, measures to reduce agricultural pollution.

N2  - Homestead food production (HFP) programs may improve diet and nutrition outcomes by increasing availability of nutrient dense foods such as vegetables and supporting livelihoods. We conducted a pair-matched cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vegetable home gardens could improve women's dietary diversity, household food security, maternal and child iron status, and the probability of women consuming nutrient-rich food groups. We enrolled 1006 women of reproductive age (18–49 years) in ten villages in Pwani Region, Eastern Tanzania, matched the villages into pairs according to village characteristics, and randomly allocated villages to intervention or control. Households in the intervention villages received agricultural training, inputs to promote home production of nutritious crops, and nutrition and health education. Data were collected in 2016, 2017, and 2019 and analyzed using linear regression models with propensity score weighting adjusting for individual-level confounders, differential loss to follow-up, and fixed effects for village pairs to accommodate the pair-matched design. Results after one year of the intervention (previously published) found significant improvements in dietary diversity. However, three years after the start of the intervention the difference in dietary diversity disappeared, even though the number of women who grew at least one crop was significantly higher (75 percentage points, 95% CI: 72, 81) in treatment households compared to controls. Barriers to maintaining a home garden, including lack of irrigation opportunities and fencing materials, and social disruption may have precluded sustained impacts from home gardening in this context. Future home garden programs should carefully consider mechanisms and investments needed for sustained impact over time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

However, most of the traditional hydrological models are programmed in monolithic approach, which makes the model improvements or couplings for integrated simulation inconvenient for the inexperienced modelers. In this paper, we develop an interface-oriented add-in modeling framework (IAMF) to enable the water system models to be more reusable, extensible and flexible. The framework is designed using the interface-oriented add-in programming paradigm to provide a “plug-and-play” fashion. Meanwhile, parallel computing is supported easily of the framework based on water system network. We also develop a basic water system model consists of ecohydrological and water resources allocation, regulation modules to show how to develop model components using the framework. Then the model is used to simulate the natural-artificial water cycles in a case study irrigated area to evaluate its applicability as a modeling tool.

N2  - Freshwater is an essential resource for human lives, agriculture, industry, and ecology. Future water supply, water withdrawal, and water security under the impacts of climate change and human interventions have been of key concern. Numerous studies have projected future changes in river runoff and surface water resources under climate change. However, the changes in the major water withdrawal components including agricultural irrigation water, industrial, domestic and ecological water withdrawal, as well as the balance between water supply and withdrawal, under the joint impacts of climate change and socio-economic development have been seldom investigated, especially at the basin and national scales. In this study, changes in surface water resources, agricultural irrigation water, industrial, domestic and ecological water withdrawal, as well as the balances between water supply and withdrawal, under the baseline climate (2006–2015), 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming scenarios (2106–2115) in the 10 major basins across China, were investigated by combining modelling and local census data. The results showed that water withdrawal exceeded water supply in the basins of Liao River, Northwest River, Hai River, Yellow River and Huai River in the baseline period. Under the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming scenarios, the shortage of water resources would aggravate in the above-mentioned basins and the Songhua River basin. And the surplus of water resources would reduce substantially in the basins of Yangtze River, Southeast River and Pearl River. Overall, the difference between water supply and water withdrawal was 435.88 billion m3 during the baseline period, and would be 261.84 and 218.39 billion m3, respectively, under the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming scenarios. This study provides a comprehensive perspective on future water security in the 10 major basins across China, has important implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation.
