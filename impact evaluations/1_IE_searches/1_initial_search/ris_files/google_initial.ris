N2  - Abstract: High population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita and a process of agricultural intensification in South Asia. While this process has significantly increased food production to feed the growing population, it has also entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. This paper employs the analytical tools of economic theory, environmental and ecological economics to model the impact of irrigation in South Asia. It underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to environmentalizing agricultural development.

N2  - In regions with a strong seasonal or interannual asymmetry in the distribution of precipitation and higher frequency of droughts, collective irrigation systems are vital infrastructures for agricultural activity. Although operating for decades, several systems have ageing infrastructures, with relevant water losses and pumping energy inefficiencies. Consequently, the systems are not adequately designed or operated to meet current and future water demand. Therefore, rehabilitation to improve water and energy efficiency while ensuring infrastructure, economic sustainability and service quality is crucial. In this sense, comprehensive approaches using performance assessment to support the planning process or benchmarking between water users associations play an essential role in improving efficiency in collective irrigation systems. However, few methodologies assess interdependencies between water losses, energy efficiency, infrastructure condition, service quality, economic and operational dimensions. Additionally, these approaches rarely were applied to the different stages of the planning process (diagnosis, planning, monitoring, and reviewing the impact of measures) and to different types of collective irrigation systems (gravity, pressurised, combined) for comparative analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive performance assessment system (PAS) for diagnosis and decision support about measures to improve water and energy efficiency in collective irrigation systems. Afterwards, the PAS is applied for diagnosis and prioritisation of alternatives to enhance the efficiency of a gravity system. The results indicate significant water losses due to the canal and intermediate reservoirs discharges and leakage in canals and low-pressure pipes, related to network ageing and insufficient flow monitoring and control for the gravity system. Ranking allowed identifying the gravity network area with high priority of intervention due to poor performance in non-revenue water, water losses due to discharges, energy efficiency of pumping stations and system energy in excess. Several alternatives were studied for this network area, and infrastructural solutions involving canal rehabilitation and water discharge control significantly impact global performance improvement besides the substantial investment associated. Subsequently, the PAS is used for comparing gravity and pressurised systems. In opposition to gravity, the pressurised system, with efficient use of water resources, presents a poor performance in pumping energy efficiency. Furthermore, the significant energy costs indicate the importance of energy improvement measures for the pressurised system. Besides assessing water and energy efficiency, the novel PAS may help managers and policymakers identify every system's best practices and weak points.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to statistically test the effect of a parcel index – consisting of a combination of a soil index, a fertility index and a location index – intended to be used as a price-determining indicator for the sale of agricultural land at farmland markets. In the hedonic price model, the coefficients of the variables representing parcel index, population, gross return and parcel irrigation investment status were positive and statistically significant at a significance level of 0.01. There was a negative relationship between parcel size and sale price, which implied that the selling price per decare tends to decrease as the parcel size increases. In the study area, the prices of farmland with large parcel sizes and irrigation efficiency investments were higher. The population density in the region and gross income from farmlands were the major factors that generated demand for the land. The hedonic price model establishes an important link between the parcel index and the sale price of farmland. Based on this link, parcel index-based pricing can contribute significantly to the creation of a farmland market in Turkey. © 2022, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.

N2  - Essay 1–Efficiency and water use: Dynamic effects of irrigation technology adoption: With the United States preparing to make a historic investment in drought mitigation, clarifying the impact of irrigation efficiency improvements on water resources is critically important. This paper uses three transitions in irrigation technology to investigate whether rebound effects cause such efficiency improvements to increase resource extraction, a phenomenon known as Jevon’s paradox. We demonstrate how staggered adoption of irrigation technologies and dynamic treatment effects can cause improperly specified two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimates to falsely indicate that technology adoption increases withdrawals. Using estimators appropriate for these circumstances, we find no significant evidence of rebound effects causing Jevon’s paradox. The significant, dynamic effects we find explain this discrepancy and, perhaps more importantly, reveal irrigators’ process of adaptation to each new technology at the intensive and extensive margins.Essay 2–Where will the United States farm carbon?: Geographic variation in the profitability and carbon sequestration potential of conservation agriculture practices will determine how cost-effective agricultural carbon credit programs are across the United States. As data on agricultural carbon credit program enrollment are unavailable, we use county-level data on the rate of adoption of conservation agriculture practices as a proxy for the profitability of the practices. We then map the predicted rates of adoption with spatially explicit carbon sequestration data for two practices and predict how the cost efficiency of agricultural carbon credit programs will vary spatially in the United States.Essay 3–Compensation mechanism, program scale, and the efficiency of voluntary carbon offset programs: In the present voluntary market for agricultural carbon credits, the fine scale nature of participation and evaluation can inhibit program administrators’ efforts to predict producers’ counterfactual behavior in the absence of a program and mitigate adverse selection. In addition, the uncertainty in estimates of soil carbon sequestration, the outcome used to issue carbon credits, increases rapidly as the scale of analysis decreases. Scaling up carbon farming programs to a jurisdiction level could address these issues by reducing uncertainty in both estimates, increasing the efficiency of achieving societal carbon sequestration goals. In such a jurisdictional approach to carbon farming programs, the program provides payments to jurisdictions based on the aggregate outcome of all producers within a jurisdiction. In this paper, we use a simulation approach to investigate the success of carbon farming programs with two different compensation mechanisms as a function of the program scale and design. When operating at the individual scale, we find programs using a per unit payment-for-sequestration approach are more efficient than those using a constant payment-per-practice mechanism only if the program administrator can estimate producers’ carbon sequestration potential with sufficient accuracy. As the uncertainty in carbon sequestration rises, the payment-for-practice program becomes more efficient in terms of the average cost of an additional unit sequestered. Finally, increasing the scale of the program improves the efficiency of the payment-for-practice program to a greater degree such that it can be more efficient than the alternative, even if the error in estimating carbon sequestration is low.

N2  - The hypothesis of a rebound effect as a consequence of water saving investments is taken analogically from the Jevons paradox models in energy economics. The European Commission (EC) alert about the consequences in water stressed regions that are investing heavily in modernization of irrigation networks and systems. This paper reviews the literature, linking water savings with water diversion and water depletion, both from theoretical models and empirical evidence from the published research. In order to increase knowledge of this phenomenon, a new empirical case study is presented based on a survey of 36,000 ha of recently modernized irrigated areas in the Guadalquivir basin (southern Spain). The results of the case study illustrates the conditions that may avoid rebound effect, although the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research are diverse and lead to contradictory results. Further research is therefore needed to determine the causes and solutions of water saving investment impacts and the possible speculative rebound effect.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of agriculture
and water policy scenarios on the sustainability of selected irrigated
farming systems in Italy, in the context of the forthcoming
implementation of the directive EC 60/2000. Directive EC 60/2000 (Water
Framework Directive) is intended to represent the reference norm
regulating water use throughout Europe. Five main scenarios were
developed reflecting aspects of agricultural policy, markets and
technologies: Agenda 2000, world market, global sustainability,
provincial agriculture and local community. These were combined with two
water price levels, representing stylised scenarios for water policy.
The effects of the scenarios on irrigated systems were simulated using
multi-attribute linear programming models representing the reactions of
the farms to external variables defined by each scenario. The output of
the models consists of economic, social and environmental indicators
aimed at quantifying the impact of the scenarios on different aspects of
sustainability relevant for irrigated farming systems. Five Italian
irrigated farming systems were considered: cereal, rice, fruit,
vegetables and citrus. The results show the diversity of irrigated
systems and the different effects that water pricing policy may produce
depending on the agricultural policy, market and technological
scenarios. They also highlight a clear trade-off between socio-economic
sustainability and environmental (water, nitrogen, pesticide)
sustainability. Water pricing will have, in most cases, less impact than
agricultural markets and policy scenarios, though it appears to be an
effective instrument for water regulation in the least intensive
irrigated systems considered. This emphasises the need for a
differentiated application of the Water Framework Directive at the local
level as well as a more careful balance of water conservation,
agricultural policy and rural development objectives. (c) 2006 Elsevier

N2  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the linkages between irrigation and poverty by offering an objective review of recent research on the subject. The key questions addressed herein are: (1) what is the role of irrigation development and management in poverty alleviation? (2) what are the linkages and pathways through which irrigation contributes to poverty alleviation? (3) what is the magnitude of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? and (4) what are key determinants of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? Our review focuses on topical empirical research studies in Asia. The extensive review suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation and poverty. These linkages are both direct and indirect. Direct linkages operate via localized and household- level effects, and indirect linkages operate via aggregate or subnational and national level impacts. Irrigation benefits the poor though higher production, higher yields, lower risk of crop failure, and higher and year-round farm and nonfarm employment. Irrigation enables smallholders to adopt more diversified cropping patterns, and to switch from low-value subsistence production to high- value market-oriented production. Increased production makes food available and affordable for the poor. The indirect linkages operate via regional, national, and economy-wide effects. Irrigation investments act as production and supply shifters, and have a strong positive effect on growth, benefiting the poor in the long run. Further, irrigation benefits also accrue to the poor and landless in the long run, although in the short run relative benefits to the landless and land-poor may be small, as the allocation of water often tends to be land-based. Despite that, the poor and landless benefit, in both absolute and relative terms, from irrigation investments. Recent advances in irrigation technologies, such as micro-irrigation systems, have strong anti-poverty potential. Ongoing studies in Asian countries document strong evidence that irrigation helps to alleviate both permanent and temporary poverty. Further, it helps to alleviate poverty in its worst forms, namely chronic poverty. In general, irrigation is productivity enhancing, growth promoting, and poverty reducing. Instances of negative externality effects associated with large and medium-scale irrigation systems point to management issues, and therefore call for more comprehensive response mechanisms from the planning and the political community alike. The anti-poverty impacts of irrigation can be intensified by creating conditions or enabling environments that could achieve functional inclusion of the poor. These include: (1) equitable access to land; (2) integrated water resource management; (3) access to and adequacy of good quality surface and groundwater; (4) modern production technology, (5) shift to high-value market-oriented production; and (6) opportunities for the sale of farm outputs at low transaction costs. The benefits of irrigation to the poor can be intensified by initiating broader level and targeted interventions simultaneously.

N2  - The paper examines the Bakolori Irrigation Project in Sokoto State, Nigeria and its impact on the intended beneficiaries of the project. The paper reviewed existing irrigation types in Nigeria and implications for sustainable food security in target communities. Also, it provides an insight into the catalogue of consequences that followed the project. Some of these include farmers' dispossessed of their productive farmlands, fraudulent reallocation processes, inadequate compensation and destruction of economic trees and crops as a result of the irrigation site. Evidences from the project shows that the project brought about certain positive developments in the lives of the target population. However, it was not devoid of undesirable challenges that require considerable attention in development project planning and implementation. These and many other issues surrounding the Bakolori irrigation project raises question on whether the project was a development or a catastrophe? Consequently, suggestions are made on how to design and implement development programmes with an overall view to improving the existing circumstances of the intended beneficiaries.

N2  - Objectives: To review the impact of agriculture interventions on nutritional status in participating households, and to analyse the characteristics of interventions that improved nutrition outcomes. Design: We identified and reviewed reports describing 30 agriculture interventions that measured impact on nutritional status. The interventions reviewed included home gardening, livestock, mixed garden and livestock, cash cropping, and irrigation. We examined the reports for the scientific quality of the research design and treatment of the data. We also assessed whether the projects invested in five types of 'capital' (physical, natural, financial, human and social) as defined in the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, a conceptual map of major factors that affect people's livelihoods. Results: Most agriculture interventions increased food production, but did not necessarily improve nutrition or health within participating households. Nutrition was improved in 11 of 13 home gardening interventions, and in 11 of 17 other types of intervention. Of the 19 interventions that had a positive effect on nutrition, 14 of them invested in four or five types of capital in addition to the agriculture intervention. Of the nine interventions that had a negative or no effect on nutrition, only one invested in four or five types of capital. Conclusions: Those agriculture interventions that invested broadly in different types of capital were more likely to improve nutrition outcomes. Those projects which invested in human capital (especially nutrition education and consideration of gender issues), and other types of capital, had a greater likelihood of effecting positive nutritional change, but such investment is neither sufficient nor always necessary to effect change.

N2  - Two possible adaptation scenarios to climate change for Sub-Saharan Africa are analyzed under the SRES B2 scenario. The first scenario doubles the irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, compared to the baseline, but keeps total crop area constant. The second scenario increases both rainfed and irrigated crop yields by 25% for all Sub-Saharan African countries. The two adaptation scenarios are analyzed with IMPACT, a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model combined with a water simulation module, and with GTAP-W, a general equilibrium model including water resources. The methodology combines the advantages of a partial equilibrium approach, which considers detailed water-agriculture linkages, with a general equilibrium approach, which takes into account linkages between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors and includes a full treatment of factor markets. The efficacy of the two scenarios as adaptation measures to cope with climate change is discussed. Due to the limited initial irrigated area in the region, an increase in agricultural productivity achieves better outcomes than an expansion of irrigated area. Even though Sub-Saharan Africa is not a key contributor to global food production (rainfed, irrigated or total), both scenarios help lower world food prices, stimulating national and international food markets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Water shortage has been a significant issue for several decades in the Texas High Plains. Agriculture has been identified as the main activity contributing to this shortage. To address this issue, many efforts have been focused on the possible adoption of sophisticated irrigation systems with high levels of water application efficiency. In this study, the entry and exit thresholds for the low-energy precision application (LEPA) system are analyzed simultaneously in cotton farming in the Texas High Plains using a real options approach. The results show that the LEPA system is profitable only when cotton price is set above $1.59/kg. The exit (entry) threshold is consistently low (high) over a range of values for parameter changes including investment cost, exit cost, variable cost, risk-adjusted discount rate, and volatility rate, so it is unlikely that farmers with irrigation systems in place would leave them easily. This implies that to attain the goal of saving water, Lubbock County needs to focus on convincing current farmers to replace old irrigation systems with new ones. © 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

N2  - Global climatic conditions are expected to become more variable in the future, which will have far-reaching impacts on food production. In Asia, many of these impacts have been measured, but a comprehensive analysis of the effects of climate change on food production at the regional scale is limited. In this study, two key issues were addressed. First, we estimated the actual trends in temperature and precipitation across 12 Asian countries in Southern, South-Eastern, Western, and Eastern Asia between 1970 and 2018 and examined their implications on food production. Second, we deployed robust estimation techniques and examined how climatic conditions influence food production across Asian sub-regions. The results show that annual temperature across Asian regions trends positively. However, a cross-country analysis reveals varied trends in annual rainfall. The regional results indicate that temperature significantly induces food production in all regions except South-Eastern Asia, where the effect is negligible. Rainfall promotes food production in Southern, South-Eastern, and Western Asia but is not favourable to food production in Eastern Asia. The findings also show that the impacts of climatic variables on food production differ significantly from country to country. Our results are robust and suggest that substantial investments in agricultural extension, research programmes, and improved irrigation infrastructure are critical to enhancing food production and security in Asia.

N2  - This paper investigates the land management practices used in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia, the factors influencing them and their implications for crop production and income. Several factors commonly hypothesised to have a major impact on land management and agricultural production - including population pressure, small landholdings, access to roads and irrigation and extension and credit programmes - are found to have limited direct impact on crop production and income, though most affect the intensity of production. The increase in farming intensity due to these factors has limited impact on value of crop production and income due to low marginal product of labour in crop production, limited productivity impact of inputs such as fertiliser in the moisture-stressed environment of Tigray and limited adoption of such inputs. We find that profitable opportunities exist to increase agricultural production and achieve more sustainable land management in the highlands of Tigray. These opportunities include improvement of crop production using low-external input investments and practices such as stone terraces, reduced tillage and reduced burning. The comparative advantage of people in the Tigray highlands is apparently not in input-intensive cereal crop production but more in such low-input approaches and in alternative livelihood activities such as improved livestock management and non - farm activities. As a result, greater emphasis on developing these alternatives in agricultural extension - as the government of Tigray has been pursuing more recently with its extension programme - and other development programmes is needed. Food crop production should not be ignored in the development strategy, but more prudent use of external inputs such as fertiliser and improved seeds, and greater emphasis on low external input sustainable land management practices, would be helpful. © The author 2007.

N2  - Climate change, water supply limits, and continued population growth have intensified the search for measures to conserve water in irrigated agriculture, the world's largest water user. Policy measures that encourage adoption of water-conserving irrigation technologies are widely believed to make more water available for cities and the environment. However, little integrated analysis has been conducted to test this hypothesis. This article presents results of an integrated basin-scale analysis linking biophysical, hydrologic, agronomic, economic, policy, and institutional dimensions of the Upper Rio Grande Basin of North America. It analyzes a series of water conservation policies for their effect on water used in irrigation and on water conserved. In contrast to widely-held beliefs, our results show that water conservation subsidies are unlikely to reduce water use under conditions that occur in many river basins. Adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies reduces valuable return flows and limits aquifer recharge. Policies aimed at reducing water applications can actually increase water depletions. Achieving real water savings requires designing institutional, technical, and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water depletions. Conservation programs that target reduced water diversions or applications provide no guarantee of saving water.

N2  - We compare ensembles of water supply and demand projections from 10 global hydrological models and six global gridded crop models. These are produced as part of the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project, with coordination from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project, and driven by outputs of general circulation models run under representative concentration pathway 8.5 as part of the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Models project that direct climate impacts to maize, soybean, wheat, and rice involve losses of 400- 1,400 Pcal (8-24% of present-day total) when CO2 fertilization effects are accounted for or 1,400-2,600 Pcal (24-43%) otherwise. Freshwater limitations in some irrigated regions (western United States; China; and West, South, and Central Asia) could necessitate the reversion of 20-60 Mha of cropland from irrigated to rainfed management by end-of-century, and a further loss of 600-2,900 Pcal of food production. In other regions (northern/eastern United States, parts of South America, much of Europe, and South East Asia) surplus water supply could in principle support a net increase in irrigation, although substantial investments in irrigation infrastructure would be required.

N2  - Irrigation expansion is critical to increase crop yields and mitigate effects from climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the low profitability has led to little irrigation investments in the region so far. Using an integrated modeling framework, we simultaneously evaluate the returns to irrigation arising from both economic and biophysical impact channels to understand what determines the profitability of irrigation in Malawi. Our results confirm that the returns to irrigation cannot cover the costs in Malawi. While labor-intensive irrigation expansion leads to unfavorable structural change in the short-run, the profitability hinges on low irrigated yields that fall far from expectations due to insufficient input use and crop management techniques. On the other hand, we find that the nonmonetary benefits of irrigation regarding higher food security, lower poverty, and reduced vulnerability to climate change make investments in irrigation worthwhile to improve the livelihoods of smallholders. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists

N2  - Given persistent gender inequalities that influence how the benefits of technologies are distributed, the expansion of small-scale irrigation technologies requires the consideration of important gender dynamics and impacts. Women's lack of agency and access to resources relative to men, and other social constraints, often limit their ability to adopt and benefit from agricultural technologies. At the same time, expanding access to agricultural technology to women may provide a pathway for empowerment. This paper explores the potential for small-scale irrigation technologies to increase women's empowerment by evaluating the impacts of an intervention that distributed motor pumps to small groups of farmers in Northern Ghana. The paper draws on two rounds of survey data that included the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, before and after the motor pump intervention was implemented. To control for possible selection bias at the baseline, the difference-in-difference method is used to estimate the impact of the program on indicators of women's empowerment. Spillover effects are estimated by comparing outcomes of farmers in treatment villages that did not receive the pumps with farmers in control villages, where no motor pumps were distributed. The results show no significant impact of the program on measures of women's empowerment. However, there are potential negative impacts, including among households that did not benefit from the intervention. The results highlight the need to pair interventions that distribute agricultural technologies with complementary investments in infrastructure that increase access to water for irrigation, as well as other activities and approaches that ensure women can reap the benefits.

N2  - Irrigation in developing countries tends to be stereotyped as equity reducing, in competition with other uses for scarce water resources, and often resulting in negative impacts for women and other disadvantaged groups. Agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction is examined. There are four inter-related mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can reduce poverty. These are: improvements in the levels and security of productivity, employment and incomes for irrigating farm households and farm labour; the linkage and multiplier effects of agricultural intensification for the wider economy; provision of opportunities for diversification of rural livelihoods; and multiple uses of irrigation supply. There are also significant risks that badly designed and managed irrigation can negatively impact on poverty. It is concluded that irrigated farming varies widely in its form and impacts, and has diverse local attributes. Water resource management decisions must recognize this and be based on an holistic and livelihood-centred assessment of irrigation benefits and costs that goes beyond food production objectives. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

N2  - The impact of small-scale irrigation investments on household consumption, assets, and informal insurance is estimated from a panel of Northern Malian households (1998-2006). Access to irrigation increases household consumption by 27-30% relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household's savings behavior and informal insurance network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a simple methodology to select a limited number of geographical areas to prioritize for commodity-specific investments in Uganda. Similar to other approaches for prioritizing investments geographically, the basic idea behind the proposed method is that districts with high agro-ecological potential, that are also far from their potential and have high levels of poverty, should be prioritized for commodity-specific investments as they are where investments are likely to have the highest impact. The methodology then proposes an iterative elimination algorithm to provide a list of suggested districts that rank high in all dimensions. The results highlight that prioritized districts are very context and commodity specific. In certain cases (e.g. sugar cane or millet), prioritized districts tend to be highly concentrated in one geographical region, whereas they tend to be more spread out for the sectors producing other commodities (i.e. bananas, coffee, goats, cassava and maize). The results are expected to inform a discussion with policymakers in Uganda which is expected to culminate in the selection of an even narrower set of districts for which more in-depth analyses of commodity-specific investments will be undertaken at the level of priority areas, including, among others, irrigation, mechanization, seeds and fertilizers.

N1  - Irrigation efficiency and productivity: scales, systems and science
N2  - This paper re-visits the concept of water efficiency applied to Spanish agriculture and assesses how this technical concept is sometimes lost in translation when applied at different spatial scales. The paper traces the historical dominance of irrigated agriculture in Spanish water policy. It analyses the water efficiency concept at the macro level, by evaluating recent national policy initiatives and public investment programmes over the last decade to modernise irrigation, which anticipated large water savings. “Water efficiency” is then framed in its socio-political context, by looking at debates and discussions over the past, current and future role of irrigation, key evaluation criteria and objectives for large scale irrigation modernisation plans, what are the links to water rights and allocation, benefits and beneficiaries from water savings and important unanticipated consequences and co-benefits in modernisation, and the reform of agricultural policies. Finally it identifies the central role played at national, European and global levels by agricultural (and energy) policies as key external drivers for the long term viability of modern irrigation on social, environmental and economic-productivity terms.

N1  - Irrigation efficiency and productivity: scales, systems and science
N2  - Recent research suggests that regional hydrologic and economic implications should be considered before adopting policies encouraging efficient irrigation technology. Investigating regional effects of irrigation efficiency investments relies on predicting how farmers will adopt irrigation technology and practices in response to different water management policies. Under water rationing, price changes, subsidies and other policies, farmers will typically trade-off water use with irrigation efficiency investment in order to maximize profits. We employ a self-calibrating profit maximizing model of agricultural production based on the existing California Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP). The model embeds irrigation efficiency vs. capital investment trade-offs for different crops to predict production, water use, irrigation investments, yields and water productivity under different water management policies. Calibration to observed cultivated areas and water application for different crops is performed using the positive mathematical programming (PMP) method. The trade-off between irrigation efficiency and capital investment is modeled as a nested constant elasticity of substitution constraint that allows substitution between irrigation investment and total applied water. The model is applied to the Tulare Basin in California's southern Central Valley. Policy simulations include an increase in water price, water rationing, and rationing and irrigation efficiency subsidies. Our results show subsidizing efficient irrigation technology may have a little effect on total land and water use and so may not promote water conservation without other incentives or regulations. Of the three policies simulated, a water price increase of 20% is found to be the most conducive to gains in agricultural water productivity (43% gain).

SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Sub-Saharan Africa
N2  - The past decade has witnessed an intensifying focus on the development of irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. It follows a 20-year hiatus in the wake of disappointing irrigation performance during the 1970s and 1980s. Persistent low productivity in African agriculture and vulnerability of African food supplies to increasing instability in international commodity markets are driving pan-African agricultural investment initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), that identify as a priority the improvement in reliability of water control for agriculture. The paper argues that, for such initiatives to be effective, there needs to be a re-appraisal of current dynamics of irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly with respect to the role of small-scale producers' initiatives in expanding irrigation. The paper reviews the principal forms such initiatives take and argues that official narratives and statistics on African irrigation often underestimate the extent of such activities. The paper identifies five key characteristics which, it argues, contradict widely held assumptions that inform irrigation policy in Africa. The paper concludes by offering a definition of 'farmer-led irrigation' that embraces a range of interaction between producers and commercial, government and non-government agencies, and identifies priority areas for research on the growth potential and impact of such interactions and strategies for their future development.

N1  - Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture
N2  - Water is critically important to the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people living on less than $1 a day, particularly for the 850 million rural poor primarily engaged in agriculture. In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear. This article provides a menu of promising pathways through which agricultural water management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction.

N2  - Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50%, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa's poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Linear programming (LP) has been widely used to solve company resource allocation problems. The technique's ability to predict how companies will adjust to changes in a variety of exogenous factors is well known, and when used at company level, it enables us to avoid aggregation problems. The decision-maker's objective in this type of research is to maximize profit estimated as gross margin. We apply the LP model to three farms in three different irrigation units that, we believe, provide a representative sample of Spanish irrigated agriculture. In focusing on the goals of this research we stress that water pricing as a single instrument for control of water use is not a valid means of significantly reducing agricultural water consumption. This is because consumption does not fall until prices reach such a level that farm income and agricultural employment are negatively affected. If water pricing is selected as a policy tool, among the consequences for agricultural sector will be that: farm income will decrease by around 40% before water demand decreases significantly. The impact of this reduction on rural areas that are dependent on irrigated agriculture will be catastrophic. Secondly there will be a reduction in the number of crops available for farming, with the consequence of a smaller number of alternatives and greater technical and economic vulnerability of the agricultural sector. Finally when water consumption decreases as a consequence of substitution of crops with higher demands for water (cotton, sugar beet, onions, corn) there will be a significant loss of employment both directly on farms and indirectly on processing facilities. These conclusions are drawn from our analysis of three irrigation units in Spain, but we believe that they offer a realistic estimate of policy impacts on the irrigated sector of Spanish agriculture. Even if price increases are not a suitable policy because of the high negative impact, we suggest that a price (around 2 PTAs/m3) might be of interest in order to make farmers aware of the scarcity of water resources, and to induce them to adopt water-saving technologies without affecting crop distribution. To make water pricing work properly under Spanish conditions, the revenues should be administered by “Comunidades de Regantes” for investment in environmental and water-saving activities, while revenues that are not appropriately invested could be transferred to the Regional Water Authority.

N2  - Water resources are essential to human development processes and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals that seek, inter alia, to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal literacy, and ensure environmental sustainability. Expanding irrigation is essential to increase agricultural production, which is needed to achieve economic development and attain food security in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Water resources and irrigated agriculture are not developed to their full potential. Currently less than 4% of renewable water resources in Africa are withdrawn for agriculture. Barriers include the lack of financial and human resources to build irrigation and related rural infrastructure and acquire agricultural technology, and inadequate access to markets. This constrains progress towards poverty reduction. We examine the linkages between agricultural water, education, markets and rural poverty through a review of published studies. We argue that, linking agricultural water, education, and market interventions, which are so often implemented separately, would generate more effective poverty reduction and hunger eradication programs. Investments in agricultural water management and complementary rural infrastructure and related policies are the pathways to break the poverty trap in smallholder African agriculture.

N2  - This article develops a stochastic dynamic model of irrigation technology adoption. It predicts that farms will not invest in modern technologies unless the expected present value of investment exceeds the cost by a potentially large hurdle rate. The article also demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, water markets can delay adoption. The introduction of a market should induce farms with abundant (scarce) water supplies to adopt earlier (later) than they would otherwise. This article was motivated by evidence that, contrary to NPV predictions, farms wait until random events such as drought drive returns significantly above costs before investing in modern irrigation technologies.

N2  - How do investments in agricultural productivity translate into development and structural transformation? An extensive literature has addressed these questions, dating back to the earliest days of development economics. In this paper, we estimate the long-run impacts of India’s irrigation canals, which span over 300,000 km and deliver water to over 100,000 villages. Drawing on high-resolution data on every household, firm, village, and town in India, we use three empirical strategies to characterize the direct and spillover effects of large increases in agricultural productivity. First, we exploit the gravity-driven nature of canal irrigation in a regression discontinuity design with elevation as the running variable. Second, we study spillovers by comparing untreated settlements close to canals to those farther away. Third, we use a 100-year panel of urban populations to estimate the effects of canals on regional urbanization. In the long run, canal access drives substantially higher irrigation intensity and land productivity. These changes result in higher population density, but treated areas experience no structural transformation: there are no changes in the share of the workforce outside of agriculture, or even in agro-processing. Consumption gains accrue only to landowners; we estimate a tight null effect on the consumption of the 60% of the population with little or no land. Structural transformation does occur, but through the growth of regional towns rather than through sectoral reallocation of labor within treated villages or their near neighbors. Our findings are consistent with a model where labor is mobile in the long run, and where urban areas have productivity advantages that cause most non-farm growth to occur in towns. In the long run, the substantial productivity effects of canals were equilibrated through the movement of labor across space rather than within locations across sectors.

N2  - The overall goal of our paper is to understand the impact that irrigation in China has had on grain production and incomes, in general, and income and poverty alleviation in poor areas, in particular. The paper seeks to meet three objectives. First, we describe the relationship among irrigation status, yields and household crop revenue. Second, we seek to understand the magnitude and nature of the effect that irrigation has on yields and crop revenue. Finally, we seek to understand the impact that irrigation has on incomes in poor areas. Our analysis shows that irrigation contributes to increases in yields for almost all crops and in income for farmers in all areas. The importance of crop income in poor areas and the strong relationship between crop revenue and irrigation provides evidence of the importance of irrigation in past and future poverty alleviation in China. We also show that in the majority of the villages that invested in new irrigation, returns are positive even after accounting for increases in capital and production costs.

N2  - The competition for limited water resources between agriculture and more highly valued domestic and industrial water uses is rapidly increasing and will likely require the transfer of water out of agriculture. This paper reviews and synthesizes the available evidence of the effects of water transfers from agricultural to urban and industrial areas on local and regional rural economies; and analyzes the possible impacts of a large reallocation on global food supply and demand. It concludes with a discussion of the potential for water policy reform and demand management to minimize adverse impacts when water is reallocated from agriculture. It is argued that comprehensive reforms are required to mitigate the potentially adverse impacts of water transfers for local communities and to sustain crop yield and output growth to meet rising food demands at the global level. Key policy reforms include the establishment of secure water rights to users; the decentralization and privatization of water management functions to appropriate levels; the use of incentives including pricing reform, especially in urban contexts, and markets in tradable property rights; and the introduction of appropriate water-saving technologies.

N2  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

N2  - The Challenge: The unimpeded growth of greenhouse gas emissions is raising the earth's temperature. The consequences include melting glaciers, more precipitation, more and more extreme weather events, and shifting seasons. The accelerating pace of climate change, combined with global population and income growth, threatens food security everywhere. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures eventually reduce yields of desirable crops while encouraging weed and pest proliferation. Changes in precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of short-run crop failures and long-run production declines. Although there will be gains in some crops in some regions of the world, the overall impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to be negative, threatening global food security. Populations in the developing world, which are already vulnerable and food insecure, are likely to be the most seriously affected. In 2005, nearly half of the economically active population in developing countries-2.5 billion people- relied on agriculture for its livelihood. Today, 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas. This Food Policy Report presents research results that quantify the climate-change impacts mentioned above, assesses the consequences for food security, and estimates the investments that would offset the negative consequences for human well-being. This analysis brings together, for the first time, detailed modeling of crop growth under climate change with insights from an extremely detailed global agriculture model, using two climate scenarios to simulate future climate.

N2  - Investing in more efficient irrigation technology is usually regarded as a means to reduce the use of water by irrigated agriculture. However, some authors report that the introduction of irrigation systems that apply water more uniformly may actually increase water catchment depletion: the so-called ‘rebound effect’. In this paper a simple model that combines irrigation, agronomic, and microeconomic concepts is used to systematically analyze the conditions under which improved irrigation application uniformity may lead to increased water use and/or consumption. The analysis is illustrated with examples from the experience with irrigation modernization in Spain. Water demand (the value of marginal water productivity) becomes inelastic as the irrigation application uniformity increases. The increase in water depletion due to the introduction of more uniform irrigation systems is insignificant if land is limited and farmers optimize their profit. If land is not a limiting factor, new water abstractions are likely to occur, potentially leading to a vicious circle in which irrigated land expands while water resources become overexploited. This cycle tends to slow down as irrigation application uniformity increases. More accurate water accounting is suggested as an instrument for controlling water depletion complementary to investing in irrigation efficiency when water conservation at the basin scale is the main objective.

N2  - This article gives a brief review of the development and current situation in global irrigation, and looks at the drivers affecting irrigation performance, development and modernization. The article concludes that the options for new developments are limited, and that future investment will need to be more precisely targeted to specific niches in different agroecological and economic contexts. The paper notes the powerful implications of global climatic change on irrigation through changes in hydrology and water supply that, in conjunction with (1) continued demand for cheap food to satisfy continuously growing populations and changing dietary preferences (projected to 2050) and (2) increasing competition for high reliability water from higher value economic sectors, indicate irrigation performance and the productivity of agricultural water use must further improve, and are also likely to become more targeted at higher value enterprises. Improving management, through better institutions and better technology will require constant adaptation and finessing, with no silver bullets currently on the horizon.

N2  - While it is widely recognized that agricultural research is a key driver of broad-based technological change in agriculture that benefits the poor in many different ways, little is known about its aggregate impacts on productivity growth and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using a polynomial distributed lag structure for agricultural research within a simultaneous system of equations framework, this paper first demonstrates that agricultural research contributes significantly to productivity growth in SSA. Productivity growth is again shown to raise per capita incomes, with income increases finally having significant poverty-reducing effects. With an aggregate rate of return of 55%, the payoffs to agricultural research are also impressive. Agricultural research currently reduces the number of poor by 2.3 million or 0.8% annually. While the actual impacts are not large enough to more than offset the poverty-increasing effects of population growth and environmental degradation, the potential impacts of agricultural research are far greater. Apart from low research investments, SSA faces several constraints outside the research system that hinder realization of potential research benefits. The results show that doubling research investments in SSA would reduce poverty by 9% annually. However, this would not be realized without more efficient extension, credit, and input supply systems.

N2  - Foreign investment in agricultural land acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa has been viewed primarily as driven by a set of linked ‘crises’: in financial capital markets, in security of energy and food supply, and in global environmental governance. This paper argues that a focus on the ‘buyers’ of land risks overlooking the dynamics that operate on the side of the land ‘sellers’. Accordingly, the first part of the paper argues that it is important to view the current ‘land grab’ as the latest stage in a longer historical process of competition for control of land and other natural resources by different ‘domestic’ economic and political actors within African countries. While such struggles are often characterised as the ‘state versus the peasantry’, with the state acting on behalf of ‘urban elites’, the paper argues that processes of accumulation and associated enclosure of natural resources need to be examined more critically in specific contexts if the role and impact of foreign capital investment are to be understood. The second part of the paper seeks to identify the ways in which questions of scale (in the sense of greater capital intensity) can be considered to be constraints to the development of African agriculture. Particularly, it considers the extent to which the production models most frequently mentioned in connection with foreign investment (large-scale mechanised farms and small-scale outgrower contract farming) respond to current productivity constraints. The paper argues that current debates about foreign investment in agricultural land underplay the importance of water resources needed to overcome production risks associated with irregular rainfall. Bringing the water dimension of land deals more clearly into focus is necessary if the scope for positive and negative impacts of new investment on existing land users is to be fully understood. The paper concludes by considering the implications of such challenges in the current context of foreign investment in agriculture in Africa.

N2  - Sustainable irrigation water management should simultaneously achieve two objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture for food security and preserving the associated natural environment. A stable relationship should be maintained between these two objectives now and in the future, while potential conflicts between these objectives should be mitigated through appropriate irrigation practices. The Aral Sea region in Central Asia is such a region that is most famous for its conflict between sustaining irrigated agriculture and preserving the environment. The current status of irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region demonstrates the Aral Sea disaster as a prime example for unsustainable irrigation development. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework for sustainable irrigation management analysis and applies it to analyze irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region. Based on the modeling outputs, alternative futures of the irrigation practice in the region are explored and it is found that to maintain current irrigation practices will lead to worsening environmental and economic consequences. Investments in infrastructure improvements (about annualized US $299 million) and crop pattern change will be necessary to sustain the irrigated agriculture and the associated environment in the region. Moreover, a penalty tax on salt discharge less than 50 US$ per ton as an economic incentive may help address environmental problems, while having only a small effect on irrigation profit.

N2  - Semi-arid agro-ecosystems are characterized by erratic rainfall and high evaporation rates leading to unreliable agricultural production. Total seasonal rainfall may be enough to sustain crop production, but its distribution and occurrence of intra-season dry spells (ISDS) and off-season dry spells (ODS) affect crop production. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) and management, especially on-farm storage ponds for supplemental irrigation offers an opportunity to mitigate the recurrent dry spells. Farm ponds are small runoff storage structures of capacities ranging from 30 to 100 m3 used mainly for supplemental irrigation of kitchen gardens, and sometimes for domestic and livestock water supply. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the hydrological and economic performance of farm ponds with the view of assessing their contributions to water and food security in semi-arid agro-systems of Kenya. Agro-hydrological evaluation of on-farm runoff storage systems entailed field survey, monitoring of water losses, analysis of rainy seasons and dry spell occurrence, soil moisture and water balance, estimation of supplemental irrigation requirement (SIR) and farm-level cost-benefit analysis of cabbage production using low-head drip irrigation system. Significant water losses through seepage and evaporation, which accounted on average for 30–50% of the stored runoff, is one of the factors that affect the adoption and up-scaling of on-farm water storage systems. Frequency analysis of rainfall revealed that there is 80% probability of occurrence of dry spells exceeding 10 and 12 days during the long rains and short rains, respectively. The occurrence of off-season (after rainfall cessation) dry spells was more pronounced than intra-seasonal (within the rainy season) dry spells. The length of intra-seasonal (10–15 days) was less than off-season dry spells (20–30 days). The occurrence of off-season dry spells coincides with the critical crop growth stage, in particular flowering and yield formation stages. A 50 m3 farm pond with a drip system irrigation system was found adequate to meet supplemental irrigation requirement for a kitchen garden of 300–600 m2 planted with a 90 days growing period cabbages. The cost-benefit analysis showed that farm ponds are feasible solutions to persistent crop failures in semi-arid areas which dominant most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

N2  - The authors of the recently completed Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) concluded that there are sufficient water resources to produce food for a growing population but that trends in consumption, production and environmental patterns, if continued, will lead to water crises in many parts of the world. Only if we act to improve water use will we meet the acute fresh water challenge. Recent spikes in food prices, partially caused by the increasing demand for agricultural products in non-food uses, underline the urgent need to invest in agricultural production, of which water management is a crucial part. The world experienced similar pressure on per capita food supplies and food prices in the 1960s and 1970s, but the challenges now are different than those we experienced 50 years ago. The world's population is substantially larger, there are many more people living in poverty, and the costs of many agricultural inputs are much higher. The current situation and the long-term outlook require a fresh look at approaches that combine different elements such as the importance of access to water for the poor, providing multiple ecosystem services, rainwater management, adapting irrigation to new needs, enhancing water productivity, and promoting the use of low-quality water in agriculture. This special issue highlights the analysis behind a number of policy options identified by the CA, a five-year multi-disciplinary research program involving 700 scientists. This introductory article sets the background and context of this special issue, introduces the key recommendations from the CA and summarizes the papers in this issue.

N2  - Australia is a major food exporting country. Recent droughts reduced dryland farming production and the volume of water allocated to irrigated agriculture, with a resulting decline in aggregate agricultural production and exports. This paper analyses the possible impact of increased water scarcity on Australian agricultural production and the magnitude of subsequent impacts on global food security. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on land and water use coupled with a hydro-economic stochastic modelling approach, the impacts of reduced agricultural production in the southern Murray–Darling Basin, and more generally for Australia, are analysed. Changes in agricultural activity, reduction in agricultural exports and altered composition of products exported attributed to the severe 2000–2009 drought are also analysed to highlight the implications for global food security. The impact of climate change on food production is examined. The analysis shows that climate change, when modelled as the extreme case, along with other factors such as land use, will impact Australian food exports. Despite its relatively small contribution to total global food supply, Australia’s contribution to international trade in wheat, meat and dairy products is substantial and could affect global food prices. Furthermore, Australia’s agricultural exports are of disproportionate importance within the South- and South–East Asian and Oceania region, both in terms of volume and for strategic reasons. Adaptation along with investment in agriculture production is needed to maintain Australian agricultural production and enhance global food security.

N2  - Rainfed agriculture plays and will continue to play a dominant role in providing food and livelihoods for an increasing world population. We describe the world's semi-arid and dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions as global hotspots, in terms of water related constraints to food production, high prevalence of malnourishment and poverty, and rapidly increasing food demands. We argue that major water investments in agriculture are required. In these regions yield gaps are large, not due to lack of water per se, but rather due to inefficient management of water, soils, and crops. An assessment of management options indicates that knowledge exists regarding technologies, management systems, and planning methods. A key strategy is to minimise risk for dry spell induced crop failures, which requires an emphasis on water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation. Large-scale adoption of water harvesting systems will require a paradigm shift in Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), in which rainfall is regarded as the entry point for the governance of freshwater, thus incorporating green water resources (sustaining rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems) and blue water resources (local runoff). The divide between rainfed and irrigated agriculture needs to be reconsidered in favor of a governance, investment, and management paradigm, which considers all water options in agricultural systems. A new focus is needed on the meso-catchment scale, as opposed to the current focus of IWRM on the basin level and the primary focus of agricultural improvements on the farmer's field. We argue that the catchment scale offers the best opportunities for water investments to build resilience in small-scale agricultural systems and to address trade-offs between water for food and other ecosystem functions and services.

N2  - This paper examines future prospects for rainfed cereal production, and its importance in the evolving global food system. First, the paper undertakes a critical synthesis of the literature to assess three primary ways to enhance rainfed cereal yields: increasing effective rainfall use through improved water management, particularly water harvesting; increasing crop yields in rainfed areas through agricultural research; and reforming policies and increasing investments in rainfed areas. Second, the IMPACT-WATER integrated water-food modeling framework is applied to assess the current situation and plausible future options of irrigation water supply and food security, primarily on a global scale. This model simulates the relationships among water availability and demand, food supply and demand, international food prices, and trade at regional and global levels. The results show that rainfed agriculture will maintain an important role in the growth of food production in the future, although appropriate investments and policy reforms will be required to enhance the contribution of rainfed agriculture.

N2  - Today, particular attention is being globally paid towards clean and sustainable energy system. The rapid development in renewable energy technologies, growth of energy markets, and adopted financial strategies and policies have the key role in achieving this target. This paper provides a comprehensive feasibility analysis of a gird-isolated hybrid renewable energy system for electrification of agriculture and irrigation area in Dongola, Sudan. A systematic and integrative framework combined with techno-economic optimization analysis for adequate planning and design of hybrid renewable energy system is proposed. Different hybridization cases of a solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, diesel generator, battery storage, and converter technologies, together with a diesel generator-based energy system as base case are modeled, evaluated and compared considering the stochastic behavior of renewable energy resources with a main target to find the most feasible and reliable solution with least system cost and realistic environmental impacts. This followed by a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effects of uncertainty in system parameters on the designed system and its economic performance. The obtained results indicate that solar-wind-diesel-battery-converter hybrid system is of optimal performance and superiority over the studied cases to serve the load demand of the investigated area. The system not only gets the minimum values of the total net present cost (24.16 M$) and levelized cost of energy (0.387 $/kWh), but also effectively achieves a positive return on investment of 39.94% and around 95% reduction in both carbon emissions and fuel consumption compared to the base case. Meanwhile, the result of sensitivity analysis demonstrates the high dependability of system cost on the volatility of solar radiation and wind speed as well as the changes in the rate of interest with the prospect of ignoring the effect of variation of diesel fuel price in the future investment decision. Finally, the output of this study is projected to raising the potentiality awareness of renewable energy in Sudan and providing a valuable reference about the optimal planning and utilization of hybrid renewable energy system in energy sector.

N2  - Developing countries allocate scarce government funds to investments in rural areas to achieve the twin goals of agricultural growth and poverty alleviation. Choices have to be made between different types of investments, especially infrastructure, human capital and agricultural research, and between different types of agricultural regions, e g, irrigated and high- and low-potential rainfed areas. This paper develops an econometric approach and provides empirical evidence on the impact of government investments in rural India. While irrigated areas played a key role in agricultural growth during the green revolution era, our results show that it is now the rainfed areas, including many less-favoured areas, that give the most growth for an additional unit of investment. Moreover, investments in rainfed areas have a much larger impact on poverty alleviation, making them a win-win strategy. These results have important policy implications, and challenge conventional thinking that public investments in rural areas should always be targeted to irrigated and other high potential areas.

Indeed, the very poorest tend not to have much land if any, and to survive almost entirely by labor. Thus, the connection is to be drawn between rising farm incomes, driven by irrigated agriculture, and employment of those with plenty of labor and very little land and capital..

N2  - In the past two decades, China has achieved world renown for reducing rural poverty. However, it is becoming harder to reduce poverty and inequality further in China, even though its economy continues to grow. This report compares the impact specific rural public investments can have on promoting growth and reducing poverty and inequality. Returns to these investments are calculated for the nation as a whole and for three economic zones in the west, central, and coastal regions of the country. Government expenditures that have the highest impact on poverty and growth include education, agricultural research and development, and rural infrastructure (roads, electricity, and telecommunications). Notably, spending on irrigation and anti-poverty loans had minimal impact. The report discusses the implications of these findings for setting future priorities for government investment. It also suggests avenues for future research and calls for a better understanding of how to improve the effectiveness of public resources. This report will be of interest to professionals involved in rural poverty reduction, rural development, agricultural growth, food security, and public investment policy.

N2  - One critical problem confronting mankind today is how to manage the intensifying competition for water between expanding urban centres, traditional agricultural activities and in-stream water uses dictated by environmental concerns. In the agricultural sector, the dwindling number of economically attractive sites for large-scale irrigation and drainage projects limits the prospects of increasing the gross cultivated area. Therefore, the required increase in agricultural production will necessarily rely largely on a more accurate estimation of crop water requirements on the one hand, and on major improvements in the construction, operation, management and performance of existing irrigation and drainage systems, on the other. The failings of present systems and the inability to sustainably exploit surface and groundwater resources can be attributed essentially to poor planning, design, system management and development. This is partly due to the inability of engineers, planners and managers to adequately quantify the effects of irrigation and drainage projects on water resources and to use these effects as guidelines for improving technology, design and management. To take full advantage of investments in agriculture, a major effort is required to modernize irrigation and drainage systems and to further develop appropriate management strategies compatible with the financial and socio-economic trends, and the environment. This calls for a holistic approach to irrigation and drainage management and monitoring so as to increase food production, conserve water, prevent soil salinization and waterlogging, and to protect the environment. All this requires, among others, enhanced research and a variety of tools such as water control and regulation equipment, remote sensing, geographic information systems, decision support systems and models, as well as field survey and evaluation techniques. To tackle this challenge, we need to focus on the following issues: affordability with respect to the application of new technologies; procedures for integrated planning and management of irrigation and drainage systems; analysis to identify causes and effects constraining irrigation and drainage system performance; evapotranspiration and related calculation methods; estimation of crop water requirements; technologies for the design, construction and modernization of irrigation and drainage systems; strategies to improve irrigation and drainage system efficiency; environmental impacts of irrigation and drainage and measures for creating and maintaining sustainability; institutional strengthening, proper financial assessment, capacity building, training and education.

N2  - During the last decade, the concept of water demand management has received increasing attention from both academics and development agencies and banks. In the face of rising costs for supply augmentation and concerns over the apparently inefficient use of water in agriculture, managing demand appears a priority means of mitigating water scarcity problems. Economists, in particular, have used theoretical frameworks to argue for the use of "economic instruments" to provide incentives that may lea d to water saving or enhancing economic efficiency. However, it has become increasingly clear to many practitioners and researchers that evidence from the field shows that the impact of economic tools has fallen short of expectations and promises. Based on an extensive review of the literature and six commissioned case studies, this document demonstrates that there are few examples in which the introduction of water pricing in irrigation schemes has successfully induced water savings. It also sh ows that there is often confusion over the different justifications for water pricing. The objectives of cost recovery and demand management must be understood and addressed separately as their realization requires the use of different charging mechanisms. In most situations farmers could pay the levels of charge required to meet ongoing operation and maintenance and future replacement costs. The widespread failure of farmers to pay is often due to dissatisfaction with the level of service provi ded, lack of confidence in the legitimacy of the charging process and the lack of resources invested in establishing effective and transparent charging mechanisms.

N2  - High investment costs together with declining world prices for food and the perceived failures of many past irrigation projects are the main reasons for the reluctance of development agencies and governments in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to invest more resources in irrigation. This study aims to establish systematically whether costs of irrigation projects in SSA are truly high, determine the factors influencing costs and performance, and recommend cost-reducing and performance-enhancing options to make irrigation investments in SSA more attractive. The study analyzes 314 irrigation projects implemented from 1967 to 2003 in 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America supported by the World Bank, African Development Bank and the International Fund for Agriculture Development. All data were obtained from Project Completion Reports and Project Performance Audit Reports, complemented with information from Staff Appraisal Reports. This paper makes three important contributions: (1) it confirms some earlier findings and disproves some popularly-held notions and incorrect perceptions about unit costs and performance of irrigation projects in SSA; (2) it provides empirical support to some existing irrigation investment policies and suggests reconsidering others; and (3) it provides some specific recommendations for future irrigation investments. Specifically, the popular view that SSA irrigation projects are expensive has to be understood in its proper context. Using simple regional averages, the unit costs in SSA appear higher than those for other regions. However, a careful look at the details reveals that under certain conditions, unit costs of irrigation projects in sub-Saharan Africa are not statistically different from those in non-SSA regions. Sub-Saharan African projects are not inherently more costly than in other regions

N2  - Poverty reduction requires economic growth which, when accompanied by sound macroeconomic management and good governance, results in sustainable and socially inclusive development (ADB 1999). Greater access of the poor to education and health services, water and sanitation, employment, credit, and markets for produce is needed. Moreover, the vulnerability of the poor to economic shocks and natural disasters must be reduced to enhance their well-being and encourage investment in human capital and in higher-risk and higher-return activities. Public policy reforms and investment in physical infrastructure will significantly contribute to the pursuit of socially inclusive development.

N2  - The adoption of more efficient farming practices and technologies that enhance agricultural productivity and improve environmental sustainability is instrumental for achieving economic growth, food security, and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa. Our research examines the interaction between public investments, community health, and adoption of productivity and land enhancing technologies by households in the northern Ethiopian state of Tigray. Agricultural technology adoption decisions are modeled as a sequential process where the timing of choices can matter. We find that time spent sick and opportunity costs of caring for sick family members are significant factors in adoption. Sickness, through its impact on household income and labor allocation decisions for healthcare and other activities, significantly reduces the likelihood of technology adoption. Our findings suggest that agencies working to improve agricultural productivity and land resource conservation should consider not only the financial status of potential adopters, but also their related health situation.

N2  - Questions as to whether public investment in international agricultural research is a ‘Good Thing’ or not may best be addressed using two arguments: (1) justifications based on whether or not past investments have yielded substantial benefits to societies and the resource-poor; and (2) that future investments need to be made as effectively and efficiently as possible, which means they must be targeted as closely as possible. A major component of any impact assessment framework that aspires to comprehensiveness is information on the location of different agricultural systems and pertinent characteristics of the resource-poor who operate them. Given the importance of livestock to the diets and incomes of poor farming households, and the predicted increase in demand for livestock products throughout the developing world over the next few decades, understanding how livestock fit into these systems, and how these systems may evolve in the future, is critical. This is especially true in Africa, where approximately 27% (162 million people) of the world's poor livestock keepers live. In this paper, we further develop a global livestock production system classification put forward by Seré and Steinfeld in 1996. These livestock systems fall into four categories: landless systems, livestock only/rangeland-based systems (areas with minimal cropping), mixed rainfed systems (mostly rainfed cropping combined with livestock) and mixed irrigated systems (a significant proportion of cropping uses irrigation and is interspersed with livestock). We then describe a method for mapping the classification, based on agro-climatology (length of growing period), land cover, and human population density. We conclude with a discussion of how the maps could be refined, and indicate their potential use in a range of different policy and research and development applications.

N2  - Water productivity is generally defined as crop yield per cubic metre of water consumption, including 'green' water (effective rainfall) for rainfed areas and both 'green' water and 'blue' water (diverted water from water systems) for irrigated areas. Water productivity defined as above varies from region to region and from field to field, depending on many factors, such as crop patterns and climate patterns (if rainfall fits crop growth), irrigation technology and field water management, land and infrastructure, and input, including labour, fertilizer and machinery. This study analyses water productivity at the global and regional levels through a holistic modelling framework, IMPACT-WATER, an integrated water and food model developed at the International Food Policy Research Institute. Scenario analysis was undertaken to explore the impact of technology and management improvement and investment on water productivity and to search for potentials in improving food security through enhancing water productivity. It is found that the water productivity of rice ranged from 0.15 to 0.60 kg m-3, while that of other cereals ranged from 0.2 to 2.4 kg m-3 in 1995. From 1995 to 2025, water productivity will increase. The global average water productivity of rice and other cereals will increase from 0.39 to 0.52 kg m-3 and from 0.67 to 1.01 kg m-3, respectively. Both the increase in crop yield and improvement in basin efficiency contribute to the increase in water productivity, but the major contribution comes from increase in the crop yield. Moreover, water productivity of irrigated crops, although higher than that of rainfed crops in developing countries, is lower in developed countries.

N2  - As efforts to mitigate climate change increase, there is a need to identify cost-effective ways to avoid emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Agriculture is rightly recognized as a source of considerable emissions, with concomitant opportunities for mitigation. Although future agricultural productivity is critical, as it will shape emissions from conversion of native landscapes to food and biofuel crops, investment in agricultural research is rarely mentioned as a mitigation strategy. Here we estimate the net effect on GHG emissions of historical agricultural intensification between 1961 and 2005. We find that while emissions from factors such as fertilizer production and application have increased, the net effect of higher yields has avoided emissions of up to 161 gigatons of carbon (GtC) (590 GtCO 2 e) since 1961. We estimate that each dollar invested in agricultural yields has resulted in 68 fewer kgC (249 kgCO 2 e) emissions relative to 1961 technology ($14.74/tC, or ∼$4/tCO 2 e), avoiding 3.6 GtC (13.1 GtCO 2 e) per year. Our analysis indicates that investment in yield improvements compares favorably with other commonly proposed mitigation strategies. Further yield improvements should therefore be prominent among efforts to reduce future GHG emissions.

N2  - This paper shows that improved technology and rural infrastructure have made important contributions to agricultural growth and poverty reduction in India. However, these effects have varied widely across agro-ecological zones. In the past, the government has devoted more resources to irrigated areas, and this has led to significant production growth and poverty reduction in those areas. However, as investments in irrigated areas continue to increase, their marginal returns diminish, and it is now in many of the rainfed areas, including some of lower agricultural potential, where the marginal returns from additional government investments in technology and infrastructure are largest.

N2  - One key poverty reduction strategy in developing countries has been the investment in agricultural water management. There are research-established linkages between irrigation water use and household welfare improvements in some developing countries. In Ghana, irrigation development for livelihood support, which dates back to the 1960s manifested in the construction of formal irrigation infrastructure, starting with the rural savannah and coastal regions. However, to date agriculture is still predominantly rainfed, small-holder and subsistence oriented. It is believed that irrigation potential for poverty reduction is yet to be achieved within the Food and Agricultural Sector Development Programme, as general poverty incidence (60.1%) is still high, particularly in the rural savannah regions of Northern Ghana. Little is however known about the poverty-reducing role of already provided infrastructure against the backdrop of rising quest for more irrigation investments. The extent of irrigation's welfare-enhancing impact is worth knowing for policy makers. Using the methods of propensity score matching (PSM) and switching regression, it is ascertained that improved access to irrigation in the rural savannah region of Ghana significantly improves household welfare via increase in net farm income, and there is more room for enhanced impacts. Pro-poor irrigation investment in this region significantly reinforces both regional and national poverty reduction drives, and is thus justified.

N2  - The global demand for water in agriculture will increase over time with increasing population, rising incomes, and changes in dietary preferences. Increasing demands for water by industrial and urban users, and water for the environment will intensify competition. At the same time, water scarcity is increasing in several important agricultural areas. We explore several pathways for ensuring that sufficient food is produced in the future, while also protecting the environment and reducing poverty. We examine four sets of scenarios that vary in their focus on investments in rainfed agriculture and irrigation, and the role of international trade in adjusting for national disparities in water endowments. Rainfed agriculture holds considerable potential but requires adequate mechanisms to reduce inherent risks. Irrigation expansion is warranted in places where water infrastructure is underinvested such as sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia the scope for improving irrigation performance and water productivity is high. International trade can help alleviate water problems in water-scarce areas, subject to economic and political considerations. We examine also a regionally optimized scenario that combines investments in rainfed and irrigated agriculture with strategic trade decisions. Compared to ‘business as usual’, this scenario reduces the amount of additional water required to meet food demands by 2050 by 80%. Some of that water could be made available for the environment and other sectors. We conclude that there are sufficient land and water resources available to satisfy global food demands during the next 50 years, but only if water is managed more effectively in agriculture.

N2  - Emergy analysis was used to analyze three agricultural systems to compare and contrast resource use, productivity, environmental impact, and overall sustainability. Emergy analysis was appropriate for this task because of its ability to transform different types of inputs to a common form (solar energy equivalents) to allow meaningful comparisons across the three systems. The systems analyzed were conventional corn (Zea mays L.) production in Kansas, USA, blackberry (Rubus rubus Watson) production in Ohio, USA, and a Lacandon polycultural rotation system in Chiapas, Mexico. Despite these different systems and diverse inputs, emergy allowed the quantification and comparison of flows for each system on a common basis. This allowed system-level conclusions and demonstrated the utility of emergy analysis when evaluating agricultural systems. The greatest inputs of emergy across the three systems were for fertilization and irrigation of the corn system. These two inputs accounted for 95% of the purchased emergy input to the corn system. The indigenous system was most reliant on renewable resources, and therefore, had the lowest level of environmental loading. The sustainability index for the three systems ranged from 0.06 for the corn system, to 0.65 for the blackberry system, to 115.98 for the indigenous system. The respective energy and emergy yield for each system were 2.6E9 J ha−1 year−1 and 3.57E15 sej ha−1 year−1 for the indigenous system, 3.71E10 J ha−1 year−1 and 8.59E15 sej ha−1 year−1 for the blackberry system, and 1.40E11 J ha−1 year−1 and 1.30E16 sej ha−1 year−1 for the corn system. While the indigenous system has the highest level of sustainability, its energy yield was 14 times less than the blackberry system, and 53 times less than the corn system. The results confirm the need for food production systems with large yields that are more dependent on renewable energies.

N2  - This paper develops a method for decomposing the contributions of various types of public investment to regional inequality and applies the method to rural China. Public investments are found to have contributed to production growth in both the agricultural and rural non-agricultural sectors, but their contributions to regional inequality have differed by type of investment and the region in which they are made. All types of investment in the least-developed western region reduce regional inequality, whereas additional investments in the coastal and central regions worsen regional inequality. Investments in rural education and agricultural R&D in the western region have the largest and most favorable impacts on reducing regional inequality.

N2  - This report relies on findings from several national surveys and current literature to assess water resource use and conservation measures within the U.S. irrigated crop sector. U.S. agriculture accounts for 80-90 percent of the Nation’s consumptive water use (water lost to the environment by evaporation, crop transpiration, or incorporation into products). Expanding water demands to support population and economic growth, environmental flows (water within wetlands, rivers, and groundwater systems needed to maintain natural ecosystems), and energy-sector growth, combined with Native American water-right claims and supply/demand shifts expected with climate change, will present new challenges for agricultural water use and conservation, particularly for the 17 Western States that account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. irrigated agriculture. Despite technological innovations, at least half of U.S. irrigated cropland acreage is still irrigated with less efficient, traditional irrigation application systems. Sustainability of irrigated agriculture will depend partly on whether producers adopt more efficient irrigation production systems that integrate improved on farm water management practices with efficient irrigation application systems.

N2  - While there is consensus that urbanization is one of the major trends of the 21st century in developing countries, there is debate as to whether urbanization will increase or decrease vulnerability to droughts. Here we examine the relationship between urbanization and water vulnerability for a fast-growing city, Chennai, India, using a coupled human–environment systems (CHES) modeling approach. Although the link between urbanization and water vulnerability is highly site-specific, our results show some generalizable factors exist. First, the urban transformation of the water system is decentralized as irrigation wells are converted to domestic wells by private individuals, and not by the municipal authority. Second, urban vulnerability to water shortages depends on a combination of several factors: the formal water infrastructure, the rate and spatial pattern of land use change, adaptation by households and the characteristics of the ground and surface water system. Third, vulnerability is dynamic, spatially variable and scale dependent. Even as household investments in private wells make individual households less vulnerable, over time and cumulatively, they make the entire region more vulnerable. Taken together, the results suggest that in order to reduce vulnerability to water shortages, there is a need for new forms of urban governance and planning institutions that are capable of managing both centralized actions by utilities and decentralized actions by millions of households.

N2  - Formalizing land rights has been promoted as a way to encourage agricultural investment and stimulate land markets, yet little is known about the benefits of such policies in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the preconditions for success are less favorable. The analysis uses a large sample of plots from an intensively titled rice-growing area of Madagascar and compares land-specific investments, land productivity, and land values for titled and untitled plots cultivated by the same household. Having a title has no significant effect on plot-specific investment and correspondingly little effect on land productivity and land values. These results are broadly consistent with a simulation of a theoretical model of investment under expropriation risk calibrated to the same data. A cost–benefit analysis suggests that the current system of formal titling should not be extended in rural Madagascar and that any new system of land registration would have to be quite inexpensive to be worthwhile.

N2  - India is one of the world's largest food producers, making the sustainability of its agricultural system of global significance. Groundwater irrigation underpins India's agriculture, currently boosting crop production by enough to feed 170 million people. Groundwater overexploitation has led to drastic declines in groundwater levels, threatening to push this vital resource out of reach for millions of small-scale farmers who are the backbone of India's food security. Historically, losing access to groundwater has decreased agricultural production and increased poverty. We take a multidisciplinary approach to assess climate change challenges facing India's agricultural system, and to assess the effectiveness of large-scale water infrastructure projects designed to meet these challenges. We find that even in areas that experience climate change induced precipitation increases, expansion of irrigated agriculture will require increasing amounts of unsustainable groundwater. The large proposed national river linking project has limited capacity to alleviate groundwater stress. Thus, without intervention, poverty and food insecurity in rural India is likely to worsen.

N2  - Available data suggest that agricultural credit has been rising in recent years as a share of both the value of inputs and the value of output. There are wide regional disparities in the disbursement of agricultural credit by scheduled commercial banks. At the same time the share of agricultural GDP in total GDP is falling. In this context, this paper examines the role of direct and indirect agriculture credit in the agriculture production taking care of the regional disparities in agriculture, credit disbursement and agriculture production in an econometric framework using Dynamic Panel Data Analysis with Instrumental Variables using Arellano-Bond Regression. The analysis suggests that the direct agriculture credit amount has a positive and statistically signifi cant impact on agriculture output and its effect is immediate. The number of accounts of the indirect agriculture credit also has a positive signifi cant impact on agriculture output, but with a year lag. These results reveal that even though there are several gaps in the present institutional credit delivery system like inadequate provision of credit to small and marginal farmers, paucity of medium and long-term lending and limited deposit mobilisation and heavy dependence on borrowed funds by major agricultural credit purveyors, agriculture credit is still playing a critical role in supporting agriculture production in India

N2  - Rainfed agriculture is generally overlooked by development investors, researchers and policy makers due to limited confidence in its ability to increase agricultural production and development. However, research undertaken by a team of leading scientists from global organizations demonstrates its potential in achieving food security, improving livelihoods and most importantly addressing issues of equity and poverty reduction in dryland areas - the hot spots of poverty. On the basis of case studies from varied agricultural and ecological regions in Asia and Africa, chapters discuss the need for adopting new paradigms between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, catchment/micro-watershed management approaches, upgrades in science-based development and more investments in rainfed areas. Yield gaps for major rainfed crops are analysed globally and possible ways and means including technological, social, and institutional options to bridge the yield gaps are discussed in detail. Covering areas such as rainwater harvesting and its efficient use, the rehabilitation of degraded land and assessment methods for social, environmental and economic impacts, this book will be necessary for both academics and policy makers working in water management, agriculture and sustainable development.

N2  - Water’s ability to generate value in irrigated agriculture remains poorly quantified at the global scale. The valuation of irrigation water is an important piece of information not only for agribusiness investors interested in the acquisition of land and water entitlements but also for farmers and rural communities that are negotiating with such investors. To make an informed decision about the acquisition or relinquishment of water rights or about investments in irrigation infrastructure there is a need for a better understanding of the value generated by irrigation water in agriculture using methods that rely on globally available data. This study provides a high-resolution global assessment of irrigation water value as a function of crop type and geographic location.

N2  - China is one of the few countries in the developing world that has made progress in reducing its total number of poor over the past 25 years.1 Chinese official documents indicate that the number of poor in China fell dramatically, from 250 million in 1978 to 30 million in 2000.2 A reduction in poverty on this scale and within such a short time is unprecedented in history and is considered by many to be one of the greatest achievements in human development in the twentieth century. Contributing to this success were policy and institutional reforms, promotion of equal access to social services and production assets, and public investments in rural areas. The literature on Chinese agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction is extensive. Few researchers, however, have attempted to link these topics to public investment.3 We argue that, even with the economic reforms that began in the late 1970s, it would have been impossible to achieve rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in China had there not been several prior decades of government investment. Before the reforms began, the effects of government investment were inhibited by policy and institutional barriers. The reforms reduced these barriers, enabling investments to generate tremendous economic growth and poverty reduction. Similarly, public investment may have played a large role in reducing regional inequality, an issue of increasing concern to policy makers. The primary purpose of this study is to develop an analytical framework for examining the specific role of different types of government expenditure on growth and poverty reduction in rural China by controlling for other factors such as institutional and policy changes. Using provincial‐level data for the past several decades, we construct an econometric model that permits the calculation of economic returns, the number of poor people raised above the poverty line, and the impact on regional inequality for additional units of expenditure on different items. The model enables us to identify the different channels through which government investments affect growth, inequality, and poverty. For instance, increased government investment in roads and education may reduce rural poverty not only by stimulating agricultural production but also by creating improved employment opportunities in the nonfarm sector. Understanding these different effects provides useful policy insights to improve the effectiveness of government poverty‐alleviation strategies. Moreover, the model enables us to calculate growth, inequality, and poverty‐reduction effects from the regional dimension. Specific regional information helps the government to better target its limited resources and achieve a more equitable regional development, a key objective that is debated in both academic and policy‐making venues in China.

Water availability strongly capitalizes into farmland values. The predicted decrease in water availability in the latest climate change scenarios downscaled to California can therefore be expected to have a significant negative impact on the value of farmland.

N2  - Despite its status as one of the world’s leading emigration countries, empirical work on Morocco has been largely absent from the lively theoretical debate on migration and development. The social and economic impact of international migration on Moroccan migrant-sending regions is assessed here through a review of empirical studies. Notwithstanding empirical gaps and methodological flaws, available evidence suggests that migration and remittances have considerably improved living conditions, income, education and spurred economic activity through agricultural, real estate and business investment, from which non-migrants indirectly profit. This has transformed migrant-sending regions such as the Rif, Sous and southern oases into relatively prosperous areas that now attract internal ‘reverse’ migrants. Although this challenges prevailing pessimism, the developmental potential of migration is not fully realized due to several structural constraints. Migration impacts are heterogeneous across space, socio-ethnic and gender groups, and tend to change over time and household migration cycles. Migration and remittances may enable people to retreat from, as much as to invest in, local economic activities, depending on the specific development context. Paradoxically, development in migrant-sending regions seems to be a prerequisite for return and investment rather than a consequence of migration.

SN  - 9789290904274
N2  - Inadequate funding for maintenance of irrigation works and emerging shortages of water are prevalent. The use of water charges to generate resources for maintenance and to reduce demand is widely advocated. Examples from other utilities, and from the domestic/industrial sectors of water supply suggest the approach could be effective. In developing countries, the facilities required for measured and controlled delivery of irrigation are rarely in place, and would require a massive investment in physical, legal and administrative infrastructure. To be effective in curtailing demand, the marginal price of water must be significant. The price levels required to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are too low to have a substantial impact on demand, much less to actually bring supply and demand into balance. On the other hand, the prices required to control demand are unlikely to be within the politically feasible range. Furthermore, water supplied is a proper measure of service in domestic and industrial uses. But in irrigation, and especially as the water resource itself becomes constrained, water consumption is the appropriate unit for water accounting. This is exceptionally difficult to measure. An alternative approach to cope with shortage would focus on assigning volumes to specific uses?effectively rationing water where demand exceeds supply. This approach has a number of potential benefits including simplicity, transparency, and the potential to tailor allocations specifically to hydrological situations, particularly where salinity is a problem. Data from Iran are presented to support these contentions.

N2  - This study, Indus basin of Pakistan: the impacts of climate risks on water and agriculture was undertaken at a pivotal time in the region. The weak summer monsoon in 2009 created drought conditions throughout the country. This followed an already tenuous situation for many rural households faced with high fuel and fertilizer costs and the impacts of rising global food prices. Then catastrophic monsoon flooding in 2010 affected over 20 million people, devastating their housing, infrastructure, and crops. Damages from this single flood event were estimated at US dollar 10 billion, half of which were losses in the agriculture sector. Notwithstanding the debate as to whether these observed extremes are evidence of climate change, an investigation is needed regarding the extent to which the country is resilient to these shocks. It is thus timely, if not critical, to focus on climate risks for water, agriculture, and food security in the Indus basin of Pakistan.

N2  - The focus in Uzbekistan on cotton and its irrigation led to large increases in water use with significant downstream impacts, particularly on the Aral Sea. While agriculture is still heavily influenced by the state, Uzbekistan has become more integrated in the global economy since its independence. The major goal of this paper is to examine the interrelationship between agricultural policies and water use during the last 15 years and how moves towards freer markets, such as those which might occur under the World Trade Organization, may impact Uzbekistan's water resources in the future. The results show that partial or full market liberalization may result in an increase in water use. However, the greater message is that non-water policies can have a major impact on water outcomes and therefore should be considered in any discussions of water sector reform.

N2  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is increasingly promoted in Africa as an alternative for coping with the need to increase food production on the basis of more sustainable farming practices. Success with adopting CA on farms in Africa has been limited, despite more than two decades of research and development investments. Through analyzing past and on-going CA experiences in a set of case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of CA and to assess where, when and for whom CA works best. CA is analyzed and understood within a framework that distinguishes the following scales of analysis: field, farm, village and region. CA has a potential to increase crop yields in the fields, especially under conditions of erratic rainfall and over the long-term as a result of a gradual increase of overall soil quality. The impact on farm income with the practice of CA on some fields of the farm is far less evident, and depends on the type of farm. The lack of an immediate increase in farm income with CA explains in many cases the non-adoption of CA. Smallholders have often short-term time horizons: future benefits do not adequately outweigh their immediate needs. Another key factor that explains the limited CA adoption in mixed crop-livestock farming systems is the fact that crop harvest residues are preferably used as fodder for livestock, preventing their use as soil cover. Finally, in most case studies good markets for purchase of inputs and sale of produce – a key prerequisite condition for adoption of new technologies – were lacking. The case studies show clear evidence for the need to target end users (not all farmers are potential end user of CA) and adapt CA systems to the local circumstances of the farmers, considering in particular the farmer's investment capacity in the practice of CA and the compatibility of CA with his/her production objectives and existing farming activities. The identification of situations where, when and for whom CA works will help future development agents to better target their investments with CA.

N2  - Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources – around 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals are used for food production. These agricultural products are traded internationally. A full understanding of water use is, therefore, impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products, such as textiles. Based on the global general equilibrium model GTAP-W, we offer a method for investigating the role of green (rain) and blue (irrigation) water resources in agriculture and within the context of international trade. We use future projections of allowable water withdrawals for surface water and groundwater to define two alternative water management scenarios. The first scenario explores a deterioration of current trends and policies in the water sector (water crisis scenario). The second scenario assumes an improvement in policies and trends in the water sector and eliminates groundwater overdraft world-wide, increasing water allocation for the environment (sustainable water use scenario). In both scenarios, welfare gains or losses are not only associated with changes in agricultural water consumption. Under the water crisis scenario, welfare not only rises for regions where water consumption increases (China, South East Asia and the USA). Welfare gains are considerable for Japan and South Korea, Southeast Asia and Western Europe as well. These regions benefit from higher levels of irrigated production and lower food prices. Alternatively, under the sustainable water use scenario, welfare losses not only affect regions where overdrafting is occurring. Welfare decreases in other regions as well. These results indicate that, for water use, there is a clear trade-off between economic welfare and environmental sustainability.

This paper analyses how global and domestic processes combine to produce patterns of agrarian transformation in Ethiopia, one of the main targets of foreign agricultural investment. The paper presents a typology of changes in land use and examines in detail three case studies of investments in Ethiopia drawn from this typology. The paper concludes that the most dramatic changes are taking place in lowland, peripheral regions where large-scale, capital-intensive farms employing wage labour pose a serious risk to pastoralists whose ‘use’ of land is contested by the state. Although the government has been careful to avoid mass displacement of settled smallholders, there are also important changes taking place in highland areas, with the government encouraging investments that combine the resources of investors with the labour and land of smallholders. These investments have resulted in exposure to new forms of market risk.

N2  - This study analyzes the effects of irrigation modernization on water conservation, using the Riegos del Alto Aragón (RAA) irrigation project (NE Spain, 123354 ha) as a case study. A conceptual approach, based on water accounting and water productivity, has been used. Traditional surface irrigation systems and modern sprinkler systems currently occupy 73% and 27% of the irrigated area, respectively. Virtually all the irrigated area is devoted to field crops. Nowadays, farmers are investing on irrigation modernization by switching from surface to sprinkler irrigation because of the lack of labour and the reduction of net incomes as a consequence of reduction in European subsidies, among other factors. At the RAA project, modern sprinkler systems present higher crop yields and more intense cropping patterns than traditional surface irrigation systems. Crop evapotranspiration and non-beneficial evapotranspiration (mainly wind drift and evaporation loses, WDEL) per unit area are higher in sprinkler irrigated than in surface irrigated areas. Our results indicate that irrigation modernization will increase water depletion and water use. Farmers will achieve higher productivity and better working conditions. Likewise, the expected decreases in RAA irrigation return flows will lead to improvements in the quality of the receiving water bodies. However, water productivity computed over water depletion will not vary with irrigation modernization due to the typical linear relationship between yield and evapotranspiration and to the effect of WDEL on the regional water balance. Future variations in crop and energy prices might change the conclusions on economic productivity.

N2  - Between 40 and 50 percent of South Africa’s population can be classified as living in poverty (Terreblanche, 2002; Woolard and Leibbrandt cited in FAO, 2004) while 25 percent of the population can be categorised as ultra-poor. Although the country is selfsufficient in food production, about 14 million people are said to be vulnerable to food insecurity and 43 percent of households suffer from food poverty (National Treasury, 2003). South Africa is classified as an upper middle-income country with one of the most skewed distribution of income in the world. The country’s Gini coefficient is estimated at 0.68 calculated from the 1996 Population Census data (Marais cited in FAO, 2004). This is higher than the Gini coefficient of 0.58 during the mid-1990s. The large income gap between the rich and poor is a matter that is receiving attention from the government. A number of policies aimed at inter alia bridging the income gap and promoting economic empowerment of previously disadvantaged communities are in place. These include the recently promulgated Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003. Poverty is more pervasive in rural areas particularly in the former homelands. The majority (65 percent) of the poor are found in rural areas and 78 percent of those likely to be chronically poor are also in rural areas (Woolard and Leibbrandt cited in FAO, 2004). Commenting on poverty in developing countries, Ashley and Maxwell (2001:395) state that “Poverty is not only widespread in rural areas, but most poverty is rural, …. Yet this core problem appears to be neglected”. They further note that there has been a decline in resource flows to the rural sector and this applies more to agriculture than it does to other sectors.

N2  - Managing water resources is one of the most pressing challenges of our times - fundamental to how we feed 2 billion more people in coming decades, eliminate poverty, and reverse ecosystem degradation. This Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, involving more than 700 leading specialists, evaluates current thinking on water and its interplay with agriculture to help chart the way forward. It offers actions for water management and water policy - to ensure more equitable and effective use. This assessment describes key water-food-environment trends that influence our lives today and uses scenarios to explore the consequences of a range of potential investments. It aims to inform investors and policymakers about water and food choices in light of such crucial influences as poverty, ecosystems, governance, and productivity. It covers rainfed agriculture, irrigation, groundwater, marginal-quality water, fisheries, livestock, rice, land, and river basins. Ample tables, graphs, and references make this an invaluable work for practitioners, academics, researchers, and policymakers in water management, agriculture, conservation, and development.

N2  - Using state-level data for 1970–93, a simultaneous equation model was developed to estimate the direct and indirect effects of different types of government expenditure on ruralpoverty and productivity growth in India. The results show that in order to reduce rural poverty, the Indian government should give highest priority to additionalinvestments in ruralroads and agriculturalresearch. These types of investment not only have much larger poverty impacts per rupee spent than any other government investment, but also generate higher productivity growth. Apart from government spending on education, which has the third largest marginalimpact on ruralpoverty and productivity growth, other investments (including irrigation, soil and water conservation, health, and rural and community development) have only modest impacts on growth and poverty per additional rupee spent.

N2  - Agricultural losses caused by salinity are difficult to assess but estimated to be substantial and expected to increase with time. Secondary salinization of agricultural lands is particularly widespread in arid and semiarid environments where crop production requires irrigation chemes. At least 20% of all irrigated lands are salt-affected, with some estimates being as high as 50%. Whereas the world’s population continues to rise, the total land area under irrigation appears to have leveled off. The need for increased food production therefore needs to be met by increases in yield per land area. To reach this goal, genetic engineering of crop plants for enhanced salt tolerance will be a very important approach. In dry regions where fresh water becomes a scarce commodity, irrigation of moderately salt tolerant crops with brackish water is feasible. Transgenic lines of some crop species have been generated which can grow and develop at fairly high salinity levels in controlled environments. These transgenics must be tested vigorously for yield potential under field conditions.

N2  - Recent developments of global models and data sets enable a new, spatially explicit and process-based assessment of green and blue water in food production and trade. An initial intercomparison of a range of different (hydrological, vegetation, crop, water resources and economic) models, confirms that green water use in global crop production is about 4–5 times greater than consumptive blue water use. Hence, the full green-to-blue spectrum of agricultural water management options needs to be used when tackling the increasing water gap in food production. The different models calculate considerable potentials for complementing the conventional approach of adding irrigation, with measures to increase water productivity, such as rainwater harvesting, supplementary irrigation, vapour shift and soil and nutrient management. Several models highlight Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, as a key region for improving water productivity in agriculture, by implementing these measures. Virtual water trade, mostly based on green water, helps to close the water gap in a number of countries. It is likely to become even more important in the future, when inequities in water availability are projected to grow, due to climate, population and other drivers of change. Further model developments and a rigorous green–blue water model intercomparison are proposed, to improve simulations at global and regional scale and to enable tradeoff analyses for the different adaptation options.

N2  - Food insecurity affects a large portion of the population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To meet future food requirements current rainfed farming systems need to upgrade yield output. One way is to improve water and fertiliser management in crop production. But adaptation among farmers will depend on perceived risk reduction of harvest failure as well as economic benefit for the household. Here, we present risk analysis and economical benefit estimates of a water harvesting (WH) system for supplemental irrigation (SI). Focus of the analysis is on reducing investment risk to improve self-sufficiency in staple food production. The analysis is based on data from two on-farm experimental sites with SI for cereals in currently practised smallholder farming system in semi-arid Burkina Faso and Kenya, respectively. The WH system enables for both SI of staple crop (sorghum and maize) and a fully irrigated off-season cash crop (tomatoes). Different investment scenarios are presented in a matrix of four reservoir sealants combined with three labour opportunity costs. It is shown that the WH system is labour intensive but risk-reducing investment at the two locations. The current cultivation practices do not attain food self-sufficiency in farm households. WH with SI resulted in a net profit of 151–626 USD year−1 ha−1 for the Burkina case and 109–477 USD year−1 ha−1 for the Kenya case depending on labour opportunity cost, compared to −83 to 15 USD year−1 ha−1 for the Burkina case and 40–130 USD year−1 ha−1 for the Kenyan case for current farming practices. Opportunity cost represents 0–66% of the investment cost in an SI system depending on type of sealant. The most economical strategy under local labour conditions was obtained using thin plastic sheeting as reservoir sealant. This resulted in a net profit of 390 and 73 USD year−1 ha−1 for the Burkina Faso and Kenyan respective site after household consumption was deducted. The analysis suggests a strong mutual dependence between investment in WH for SI and input of fertiliser. The WH system is only economically viable if combined with improved soil fertility management, but the investment in fertiliser inputs may only be viable in the long term when combined with SI.

N2  - An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workforces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated “growth corridors”, which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them to hinterland areas could favour shifts to African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploit the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits.

N2  - To meet the objectives of increasing food production and alleviating poverty and hunger in an environmentally sustainable manner will require a renewed focus on agricultural water management and institutional innovations for managing water. In some areas of the world demand for water for various uses exceeds supply. But for much of the world there is a pending crisis of water supply not because of a shortage of water but because of mismanagement of water resources. This report defines water scarcity from the perspective of individual water users who lack secure access to safe and affordable water to consistently satisfy their needs for food production, drinking, washing, or livelihoods.

N2  - Are we headed toward a worldwide water crisis? The increasing demand for water among households, industry, the environment, and especially agriculture is making global water scarcity a perilous possibility.What will happen to food production and global food security as water becomes increasingly scarce? What steps can we take to avert threats to global food supply, the environment, and the livelihoods of those lacking access to clean water? Using state-of-the-art computer modeling to show how water availability and demand are likely to evolve, World Water and Food to 2025 contends that if current water policies continue, so will high levels of food insecurity, environmental degradation, and water-related ill health. Further neglect of water issues could produce a genuine water crisis, which in turn could lead to a food crisis. But we can avoid these outcomes if we make fundamental policy changes now. The authors show exactly which policies and actions could ensure sustainable and efficient water use, enough food for the world’s people, and adequate drinking water for all.

N2  - The “Big Dry”, a prolonged dry period in Australia from 1997 to 2009, dried out much of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and resulted in large agricultural losses and degraded river ecosystems. Climate projections are that dry conditions in the MDB are likely to be more regular and severe than ever before, and recent policy initiatives are likely to reduce consumptive water use and redirect water to ecosystem management. This paper aims to develop an understanding of the interactions between water policy and irrigation practices by deriving lessons from drought management in irrigated agriculture of the MDB during the Big Dry, and furthermore, to draw out lessons to enhance the preparedness of irrigated agriculture for a future drier climate and reduced water availability. Reviews of irrigation farmers’ practices, attitudes and capacity to manage during prolonged droughts in the MDB, and the evolution of agricultural water policy in Australia since 1990 were made. It is clear that farmers could be better prepared to deal with a drier climate if their water management practices, e.g. irrigation methods and soil moisture measuring tools are improved, if the impediments to the uncertainty of water allocation and low water availability could be overcome, and if well-targeted research and extension could assist farmers to use water more wisely. It is also clear that Australian water policy could be better prepared in terms of assisting irrigated agriculture to deal with a drier climate. Key areas are reduction of barriers and distortions to water trading, optimizing the environmental water allocation, and seeking mutual benefits between environmental water allocation and irrigated agriculture, improvement of the cost-effectiveness of investments in water supply infrastructure, facilitating carryover and capacity sharing at larger scales, and provision of accurate, accessible and useful water information at different scales. An approach to irrigation practice and water policy is proposed based on past experience and potential opportunities. The approach is a set of linked strategies for more robust agricultural production and a more sustainable environment under a drier climate and reduced water availability.

N2  - The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the context of resource management those include but are not limited to the diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However, implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels. Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of different institutional settings of water management to changes in the variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to investigate the influence of (1) the organizational structure of water management, (2) information on water availability, and (3) the diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime are compared under different scenarios of information on water availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority, the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e.g., irrigation and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of different system structures will help to identify properties and mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions in specific river basins.

N2  - Agricultural development is essential for economic growth, rural development, and poverty alleviation in low-income developing countries. Increasing agricultural productivity is an effective driver of economic growth and poverty reduction, both within and outside agricultural sectors. Increasing productivity requires good rural infrastructure, well-functioning domestic markets, appropriate institutions, and access to appropriate technology. Despite the well-documented importance of rural infrastructure to promote growth and reduce poverty, the high economic rates of return on investment in rural infrastructure, and significant deficiencies of rural infrastructure in most developing countries, neither national governments nor international aid agencies seem to prioritize investment in the construction of new infrastructure or in the maintenance of existing infrastructure. Failure to accelerate investment in rural infrastructure will make a mockery of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in poor developing countries and severely limit their ability to benefit from trade liberalization, international capital markets, and other potential gains from globalization.

N2  - A conceptual model of a representative irrigated farm is formulated to study farm responses to two economic policies commonly suggested to encourage agricultural water conservation, and to characterize the hydrological and economic circumstances in which these responses provide the desired conservation. The economic policies studied are to increase the irrigator's cost of applied water and to subsidize the irrigator's cost of investing in improved on-farm irrigation efficiency. Comparative statics results demonstrate that increasing the cost of applied water may be a more effectual water conservation policy than subsidizing the cost of improved on-farm irrigation efficiency.

This sector accounts for about 65 percent of the work force, about 40 percent of the gross domestic product, and about 40 percent of foreign currencies acquired through exports. Although agriculture is a key part of the country's economy, the structure of the sector is vulnerable because it relies on rainfed agriculture during a roughly six-month rainy season. Droughts and other types of unseasonable weather pose risks for farmers. Under these conditions, irrigation development offers the promise of greater food security and the rural-area development by ensuring yearlong agricultural production."

N2  - Large-scale acquisitions of farmland in Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Southeast Asia are making headlines in a flurry of media reports across the world. Lands that only a short time ago seemed of little outside interest are now being sought by international investors by the tune of hundreds of thousands of hectares. And while a failed attempt to lease 1.3 million hectares in Madagascar has attracted much media attention, deals reported in the international press constitute the tip of the iceberg. Despite the spate of media reports and rare published research, international land deals and their impacts still remain little understood. This report is a step towards filling this gap. The outcome of a collaboration between IIED, FAO and IFAD, the report discusses key trends and drivers in land acquisitions, the contractual arrangements underpinning them and the way these are negotiated, and the early impacts on land access for rural people in recipient countries. While international land deals are emerging as a global phenomenon, this report focuses on sub-Saharan Africa. This report has been produced under IIED’s Legal tools for citizen empowerment project

N2  - Irrigated agriculture is the main source of water withdrawals, accounting for around 70% of all the world's freshwater withdrawals. The development of irrigated agriculture has boosted agricultural yields and contributed to price stability, making it possible to feed the world's growing population. Rapidly increasing nonagricultural demands for water, changing food preferences, global climate change, and new demands for biofuel production place increasing pressure on scarce water resources. Challenges of growing water scarcity for agriculture are heightened by the increasing costs of developing new water, soil degradation, groundwater depletion, increasing water pollution, the degradation of water-related ecosystems, and wasteful use of already developed water supplies. This article discusses the role of water for agriculture and food security, the challenges facing irrigated agriculture, and the range of policies, institutions, and investments needed to secure adequate access to water for food today and in the future.

N2  - This paper provides an overview of the issues in and approaches to measuring and enhancing the value of agricultural water in large irrigated river basins. It develops a framework and a set of indicators for valuing agricultural water by looking into various dimensions and underlying key factors that influence the value of water at micro, meso and macro levels. The indicators are applied to recent, primary- and secondary-level empirical data from the Indus basin Irrigation system of Pakistan. In addition, the paper compiles recent estimates of the value of agricultural water from 40 settings in 23 countries. Finally, the paper outlines measures for enhancing the value of agricultural water. The paper makes four main points: (1) The popular productivity indicators based on crop output do not capture the full range of benefits and costs associated with agricultural water use. (2) The value of agricultural water may not be as low as it is generally perceived or estimated when all major uses and direct and indirect benefits of water at various levels are properly accounted for. (3) The value of water varies across time and space, and the value to stakeholders at various scales (farmer, system manager, basin planner and national policy maker) could be quite different. For example, the estimate of agricultural water value in the upper Indus basin in Pakistan varies from US$0.04/m3 at the farm scale to US$0.22/m3 at the national scale. The farm-scale value is more relevant, e.g., for agricultural water charging policies, but for water-sector investments and allocation decisions, the national-scale value is important. The decision-making processes related to water sector investments, allocations, management, and charging/cost recovery schemes could be potentially misguided if key dimensions of water value that are related to water availability and use, benefits/costs, and temporal and spatial aspects are not properly accounted for in valuation. (4) Efforts should be directed not only at increasing the productivity of water in terms of mass of output per unit of water, but also the overall benefits or value of water at various levels for larger growth and poverty alleviation impacts, considering the sustainability of the systems.

N2  - Climate change threatens agricultural production and the food security of developing countries in complex ways that demand environmentally friendly innovations. Climate-smart agriculture provides a response to climate change whilst enhancing livelihood of farmers. Climate-smart agricultural technological innovations at farm level have the potential to address climate-related challenges. However, inadequate adoption of these technologies remains a problem. This paper identifies available climate-smart agricultural technological innovations in South Africa and explores their characteristics and context of use using an exploratory research approach. An overview of climate change risks and variability in South Africa and a framework to classify the technological innovations is established based on a literature review. Interviews with expert stakeholders are used to characterise and collect information on available technologies. Results indicate that Conservation Agriculture, Rainwater Harvesting and Seed Varieties that are Drought Tolerant and Early Maturing may be the most suited technologies for climate-smart agriculture in South Africa, particularly for smallholder farmers. However, high initial investment costs, additional labour requirements and management intensity associated with conservation agriculture and rainwater harvesting may pose problems within the South African context. Drought Tolerant and Early Maturing Seed Varieties were noted as less costly and less management intensive, creating better prospects for adoption. This study serves as an initial assessment through the exploration of the available climate-smart agricultural technologies in South Africa. This is essential given that the agricultural sector is faced with the dilemma of responding to climate change related challenges whilst increasing the productivity of farmers.

N2  - Exponential growth of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is causing climate change. It affects agriculture, forestry, human health, biodiversity, snow coverand aquatic to mountain ecosystems. Changes in climatic factors like temperature, solar radiation and precipitation have potentials to influence crop production. Despite many efforts possible on combating impacts of climate change, there are still difficulties in Nepalese agriculture. With an average of 0.06ºC/yea, a rise in temperature from 1975 to 2006 by 1.8ºC has been recorded in the country. Problem of frequent drought, severe floods, landslides and mixed type of effects in agricultural crops have been experienced in Nepal because of climate change. Study done on CO2 enrichment technology at Khumaltar revealed that the yield of rice and wheat increased by 26.6% and 18.4% due to double CO2, 17.1% and 8.6% due to increase in temperature respectively. A crop simulation model (DSSAT) to study the effects of CO2, temperature and rain in NARC showed positive effect in yield of rice and wheat in all regions, but negative effect in maize especially in Terai. In Nepalese agriculture, the time has come for the authorities to find out adaptive measures to mitigate the effects to reduce untold natural calamities and miseries due to recent erratic weather pattern.

N2  - Background For agricultural systems to achieve climate-smart objectives, including improved food security and rural livelihoods as well as climate change adaptation and mitigation, they often need to be take a landscape approach; they must become ‘climate-smart landscapes’. Climate-smart landscapes operate on the principles of integrated landscape management, while explicitly incorporating adaptation and mitigation into their management objectives. Results An assessment of climate change dynamics related to agriculture suggests that three key features characterize a climate-smart landscape: climate-smart practices at the field and farm scale; diversity of land use across the landscape to provide resilience; and management of land use interactions at landscape scale to achieve social, economic and ecological impacts. To implement climate-smart agricultural landscapes with these features (that is, to successfully promote and sustain them over time, in the context of dynamic economic, social, ecological and climate conditions) requires several institutional mechanisms: multi-stakeholder planning, supportive landscape governance and resource tenure, spatially-targeted investment in the landscape that supports climate-smart objectives, and tracking change to determine if social and climate goals are being met at different scales. Examples of climate-smart landscape initiatives in Madagascar’s Highlands, the African Sahel and Australian Wet Tropics illustrate the application of these elements in contrasting contexts. Conclusions To achieve climate-smart landscape initiatives widely and at scale will require strengthened technical capacities, institutions and political support for multi-stakeholder planning, governance, spatial targeting of investments and multi-objective impact monitoring.

N2  - Successful adaptation of agriculture to ongoing climate changes would help to maintain productivity growth and thereby reduce pressure to bring new lands into agriculture. In this paper we investigate the potential co-benefits of adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use, called SIMPLE, is utilized to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates, and land use emissions. A scenario of global adaptation to offset negative yield impacts of temperature and precipitation changes to 2050, which requires a cumulative 225 billion USD of additional investment, results in 61 Mha less conversion of cropland and 15 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) fewer emissions by 2050. Thus our estimates imply an annual mitigation co-benefit of 0.35 GtCO2e yr−1 while spending $15 per tonne CO2e of avoided emissions. Uncertainty analysis is used to estimate a 5–95% confidence interval around these numbers of 0.25–0.43 Gt and $11–$22 per tonne CO2e. A scenario of adaptation focused only on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, while less costly in aggregate, results in much smaller mitigation potentials and higher per tonne costs. These results indicate that although investing in the least developed areas may be most desirable for the main objectives of adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant. Adaptation investments in high yielding, land scarce regions such as Asia and North America are more effective for mitigation. To identify data needs, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using the Morris method (Morris 1991 Technometrics 33 161–74). The three most critical parameters for improving estimates of mitigation potential are (in descending order) the emissions factors for converting land to agriculture, the price elasticity of land supply with respect to land rents, and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs. For assessing the mitigation costs, the elasticity of productivity with respect to investments in research and development is also very important. Overall, this study finds that broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are inexpensive relative to many activities whose main purpose is mitigation. These results therefore challenge the current approach of most climate financing portfolios, which support adaptation from funds completely separate from—and often much smaller than—mitigation ones.

N2  - The agro-ecosystems of semi-arid and dry sub-humid SSA are inherently dynamic. At this point in time they are also experiencing a series of complex social–ecological changes that make their future even more uncertain. To ensure that development investments made today in the small-scale farming systems that dominate these regions make sense also in a long-term perspective they should benefit the local communities over a range of potential futures. We applied a participatory scenario planning approach to a smallholder farming community in semi-arid Tanzania, exploring four alternative development trajectories for the area, to increase the robustness of current investments in small-scale water system technologies. We found that water system technologies will be important across a number of possible futures, but that the most relevant target of these innovations, e.g., staple- versus cash-crop production, or individual- versus community-managed systems, differs. We argue that building capacity for experimentation among farmers is key to upgrading their farming systems, as this will generate benefits over a range of alternative futures. Furthermore, we found it to be essential across a range of scenarios to analyze the system-level impact of proposed interventions for successful investments in water system technologies. We conclude that although the method presents some challenges, participatory scenario planning is a useful tool for integrating research and development projects in the larger context, asit increases the understanding of events and processes that may either challenge the project or provide opportunities for it.

N2  - In West Azerbaijan Province, following the Urmia Lake crisis, a special focus has been placed on development of drip irrigation methods, but unfortunately, not much success has been achieved and even a return to traditional irrigation in several cases was happened. Apple, as a product with high water need, occupies more than half of the orchards of the province and especially Urmia city. According to the reported statistics, the performance of West Azerbaijan in terms of the implementation of drip irrigation systems during the last 13 years has always been significantly lower than the national average level and has covered a maximum of about 11% of the province's gardens. The current study by applying survey research method and the Everett Rogers model, was conducted with the aim of identifying and analyzing the factors influencing acceptance or rejection of irrigation system in apple orchards of Urmia as the polemic center of apple production in the province. Based on the obtained results, it was determined that 57% of the respondents believe that the implementation of drip irrigation using common water resources has many problems, 63% of them also considered the system is unsuitable for old gardens. About 64% of the respondents believe that in current situation the relative utility of the system is in the range of medium to low. 77% also believe that drip irrigation systems do not have high performance due to various reasons. Due to 81.5% of the respondent’s opinion applicability of these systems are complex Compared to traditional methods, because of performance, employment, administrative bureaucracy, obtaining facilities, repair and maintenance. According to the Cox-Nell and Nagelkerke statistics the variables included in the model are able to explain 0.508 and 0.681 of the variance of the drip irrigation acceptance variable, respectively. The most important recommendations applicable in the region, according to the obtained results, are: Using successful models and reference groups to provide practical trainings on irrigation systems, Increasing the relative benefit and reducing the risk of investing in drip irrigation, Increasing the cost of using traditional systems, Reviewing the process of designing, implementation, the workflow and the quality of equipments in drip irrigation systems, Issuing necessary permits for undocumented lands and finally, not prescribing drip irrigation for old gardens.

The study utilizes secondary data sources and a time-series analysis from 2000 to 2020. The results of the study suggest that weather patterns and technological advancements are significant factors affecting agricultural production in the region. Specifically, an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall have a negative impact on agricultural output, while investments in technology such as irrigation systems, machinery, and fertilizers have a positive effect. The study highlights the importance of investments in technology and infrastructure to increase agricultural output and improve the economy of the Khorezm region.

N2  - The use of the internet is growing rapidly and has become an engine for economic development. However, few studies have examined the impact of internet use on agricultural production, and the results are not yet conclusive. Employing a dataset of more than 2000 observations in rural Vietnam, our study analyses the impact of internet use on agricultural productivity using the heteroscedasticity-based instrument approach suggested by Lewbel, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 2012, 30, 67–80 and examines the heterogeneity and distribution of the impact using quantile regressions. Our results show that internet use has significant and positive effects on agricultural productivity. However, these effects are heterogeneous across population groups. The positive effects of internet use are stronger for households with a lower level of education, with a young and female head, and from ethnic minorities. The benefits are also found to be skewed towards the group of farmers at the bottom of the productivity distribution. Therefore, we propose facilitating the diffusion of the internet, since it not only boosts agricultural productivity, but also reduces productivity inequality. In addition, we recommend promoting rural education, supporting local markets, investing more in irrigation systems, and facilitating farm mechanisation as these factors are found to contribute to increasing agricultural productivity.

N2  - This study assesses the effect of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technology adoption on the welfare status of households in a subsistence mixed farming system in the Geshy watershed, South West Ethiopia. Due to the changing climate, characterized by changes in patterns of rainfall and rising temperature, the livelihoods of smallholder rural farmers in the Geshy watershed are highly threatened. For these households that are highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture, coping mechanisms, proper adaptation, and mitigation measures are hence important steps to secure household incomes and livelihoods. CSA offers this opportunity. A survey data collected from 384 households cross-sectionally was used to analyze the impact of CSA on food security and household income. The research model used in this study was the endogenous switching regression model which controls unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias, a method used commonly in analyzing adoption impacts. The study comes up with various socioeconomic and agricultural factors influencing food security and CSA adoption. The econometric analysis result shows that the variables that had a significant impact on farmers’ decisions for CSA adoption were field soil fertility status, distance to market, asset ownership, and livestock ownership. The average values of the treatment effects of the untreated (ATU) and treated (ATT) result in a positive and significant impact on farmers’ welfare. Factors such as household head education, size of labor, livestock size, and asset index significantly affected household income. The level of education, the size of irrigable land, and livestock size influenced food security. This study concludes that households that adopted more CSA practices experience better welfare. Access to inputs, encouraging investments in assets, irrigation, and livestock production, providing incentives to input dealers for rural areas decentralization, and access to weather forecasts need to be improved to exploit the full potential of climate-smart agriculture technologies as policy recommendations.

N2  - Context: Conversion of native vegetation to cropland is one of the most widespread anthropogenic landscape alterations, particularly in the Great Plains region of the United States. Mule deer occur throughout the Great Plains; however, it is the south-eastern edge of their geographical distribution, and few populations coincide with dense cropland. The rapidly depleting Ogallala Aquifer supplies irrigation to row-crops throughout the region, which will likely shift towards dryland agricultural practices in the near future. Aims: We sought to understand how cropland use influences morphology, body condition indices, reproductive output, and survival of free-ranging mule deer. Methods: We accumulated a multi-year, longitudinal dataset of movement and morphology for 146 mule deer in the Texas Panhandle. We linked seasonal cropland use with observed morphology, body condition metrics, and reproductive output via linear mixed-effect modelling and assessed the influence of cropland on annual survival by using Cox proportional hazard models. Key results: Mule deer that did not use cropland at any time during the year exhibited morphological and nutritional indices similar to those that did; except body-fat percentage being greater for mature (≥4-year-old) males that used cropland. Further, cropland use did not predict survival probability. Analyses of cropland use during seasons defined by life-stage showed context-dependent nutritional benefits. Use of cropland during winter following reproduction demonstrated an increase in young (≤3-year-old) male antler size and body mass and summer crop use increased body condition for all males. Female mule deer that utilised cropland before pregnancy had increased probability of successful reproduction, demonstrating a potential capital investment strategy in reproduction. Conclusions: Cropland does not limit morphology or survival of mule deer; however, additive use of row-crops can provide a nutritional buffer and enhanced reproductive output for individuals that choose to utilise it. Implications: Our study demonstrates important population-level interactions with the environment for a species near the extent of their geographical distribution. Conversion of row-crop farming from aquifer depletion or climate shifts may not diminish mule deer populations, but these changes may alter specific habitat-nutritional health relationships that can influence population performance and future conservation efforts.

N2  - The use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in agriculture such as the Rice Crop Manager (RCM) has provided farmers crop nutrient management guidelines for irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. The study aimed to evaluate the RCM and its enhanced calculation in low yielding areas to increase farmer’s harvest and income. It was conducted at Research Outreach Station (ROS) Magalang, which was situated in a lowland irrigated ecosystem. It started during the wet season 2019 up to dry season of 2020. The treatments were farmer’s practice (FP), Standard RCM (RCM1) and enhanced RCM recommendation (RCM2), which Random Complete Block was used as an experimental design. The results showed that highest application of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium was observed in FP during wet season, which was 31.6% higher than others. While, during the dry season RCM2 has the highest application at 128 kgs./ha of Nitrogen. Based on yield difference during wet season, RCM2 showed a significant yield increase with 4.36 MT/ha, it was 19% higher from FP and 14% from RCM1. While, yield during dry season RCM2 showed a significant yield increase with 5.82 MT/ha, it was 72% higher from FP and 2% from RCM1. With the result from yield also implied highest net income of 29,538 pesos a 69.4% Return on Investment (ROI) from RCM2 during wet season and 49,604 pesos a 106.23% ROI during dry season. Overall the application of RCM and its enhanced version had significantly increased the yield and income of a low yielding area.

N2  - One of the key components essential to the productivity of emerging small-scale farmers who secured farms through the land redistribution programme in South Africa is access to adequate and reliable sources of water for irrigation. The lack of access to water compounds the adverse impact of challenges that inter alia include the high cost of electricity and lack of farming knowledge prevalent among these farmers. Securing a water use licence and accessing water for irrigated agriculture is not guaranteed for most emerging farmers. Often, they do not have sufficient finance and access to technical expertise to invest in sustainable water supply-systems for irrigation. Consequently, the operations of the majority of these farmers are sub-economic, which indicates a need for greater efforts towards ensuring improved access to water for them. Ceteris paribus, this will enhance their chances of realising greater agricultural production and, in the process, improved livelihoods.

N2  - Agricultural irrigation is a primary user for freshwater withdrawal. Irrigation plays an important role in crop production, as it provides the benefit of reducing the effects of prolonged dryness and erratic precipitation. Center pivot irrigation system is the most common irrigation system in agriculture. As the center pivot irrigation system ages, the system could develop a leaking joint, clogged sprinklers, and physical damage. This can cause areas of non-uniformity that can lead to under- or over-irrigated in some areas of the land, resulting in excess energy use and cost, wasting resources, and environmental impacts. Thus, it is important to evaluate the performance of a center pivot irrigation system regularly to maximize return on investments and minimize wasting resources. This study focuses on evaluating the impacts and benefits of improved center pivot irrigation distribution uniformity by performing distribution uniformity evaluations pre- and post-retrofit. This study also focused on demonstrating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assess the performance of the center pivot irrigation system in two irrigated farmlands. The Coefficient of Uniformity (CU), Distribution Uniformity (DU), and Scheduling Coefficient (SC) were calculated based on the catch can test data. The values were utilized to evaluate water and energy savings from the improved coefficients. The team has found that replacing sprinkler packages increased the CU from 78 to 89 and the DU from 77 to 82, and reduced the SC from 1.3 to 1.2 in Field A. In Field B, replacing sprinkler packages increased the CU from 73 to 91 and the DU from 62 to 84 and reduced the SC from 1.6 to 1.2. The estimated water savings in Field A due to the reduced scheduling coefficient was approximately 151,000 liters/hectare/year, with consideration of the corn and soybean rotation field in Michigan. The estimated water savings in Field B was 608,000 liters/hectare/year. The data from this demonstration study showed the value of distribution uniformity evaluation and retrofit of irrigation systems. This information will encourage farmers and agricultural industries to consider performing more distribution uniformity evaluations, ultimately improving irrigation water use efficiency and supporting sustainable water management in agriculture.

N2  - The utilization of solar energy is a vital strategy in the agricultural sector’s efforts to address and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This renewable resource can greatly decrease the industry’s carbon footprint and play a significant role in combating climate change. In this context, this study examines an automatic solar system installed in a south-facing agricultural greenhouse and its effect on the growth of strawberry plants in winter. Heat is transferred from the environment during the day to the structure at night using this technology, which uses water flowing in a closed circuit that is put on the greenhouse roof. This system includes a battery, a photovoltaic solar panel to power some accessories, a copper coil placed within double glass on the greenhouse’s roof, a water pump circulator, and storage tanks. Two greenhouses—one experimental with a solar heating system and the other reference without one—were used for the comparative experimental investigation. Both greenhouses are constructed on the terrace of Mohammed V University’s Solar Energy and Environment Laboratory in Rabat, Morocco. An environmental monitoring system was built to automatically measure environmental parameters. Real-time data visualization and analysis may be done from any place via a website with the Internet of Things integrated into the system. The greenhouse’s microclimate was improved by this low-cost technology, which also allowed for winter heating. Compared to the control greenhouse, this improvement allowed for a 17-day earlier harvest and a 30% reduction in irrigation water usage. The economic analysis findings show that the system is profitable for investments and energy savings.

T1  - The Impacts of Irrigation
A1  - Giordano, Mark

N2  - Irrigation development has historically comprised a considerable proportion of the overall infrastructure investment portfolio of the Bank. However, after a surge from the 1960s to 1980s in the level of public investment in the irrigation sector, the enthusiasm for continued investment (particularly in new irrigation development) has softened, except in sub-Saharan Africa. There may be multiple reasons for this change. Irrigations very success, in concert with other investments in agriculture, took away the imperative for continued rapid expansion of the global food supply. At the same time, despite this success in increasing food output, large scale irrigation systems are often viewed as failing to live up to their potential and require consistent injections of outside capital for operations and maintenance. Irrigation is also associated with negative externalities, particularly as related to the environment. Finally, the potential poverty reduction role of irrigation, particularly large-scale irrigation, may have changed as areas suitable for new irrigation development have declined and populations urbanize. Nonetheless, the pressure to meet growing food demand and provide low cost food to an increasingly urban world persists. Continued irrigation investments, even if not following past models, must play a key role in relieving that pressure. To assess empirical evidence of the irrigation impacts highlighted above and provide guidance to future investment, we reviewed a wide range of published literature (over 500 articles with over 250 cited in the bibliography) on irrigation impact. Potential studies were identified using keyword searches focused on irrigation and impact, an examination of the bibliographies of the identified studies, and bibliographies of previous assessments of irrigation impact. While we focused our analysis and discussion on studies published in the last 25 years, we also drew on earlier works to provide context and insights. Where possible we concentrated on peer-reviewed studies that used primary data to empirically measure impact and studies of economy wide processes based using secondary data. We supplemented the results with insights from qualitative studies that provide understanding of the mechanisms through which irrigation impacts occur. Our goal was to identify and provide context for an illustrative range of impact assessments from a variety of literatures, but our sample cannot be considered as representative in a statistical sense.

N2  - Brazil is one of the largest suppliers of commodities in the world, partly due to the agricultural expansion in the Cerrado biome that began in the 1970s. However, as areas with better soil and climate for agriculture become scarce, farmers advanced to marginal lands, where precipitation is less reliable for rainfed crops. The overall goal of this paper is to investigate the implications of occupying drier areas in the Cerrado biome, which are likely to become more so in the future. We estimated the effect of temperature and precipitation on soybean yields (kg/ha) using panel data regression at the municipal level, from 1980 to 2016, and at the farm-level in a subset region known as Matopiba. Our analysis estimated a reduction of 6% in soybean yield for each 1°C increase in temperature. According to interviewed farmers, the consequences of the recent droughts include land concentration and increased indebtedness. Based on historical observations, agricultural technologies do not provide adaptation to extreme heat and created a dependency on capital availability for investments in irrigation, raising questions about the future sustainability of this capital-intensive agricultural system if breakthroughs in adaptation do not occur.

A1  - Kumar, Parveen
N2  - Economic liberalization, it was maintained, would provide a positive shift in the terms of trade for agriculture in India, allowing farmers to plow back excess from farming to undertake longterm improvements on the land and increase agricultural productivity and growth rate. Contrary to expectations, the terms of trade for agriculture did not significantly increase during the reform period. Additionally, a considerable number of individuals who depend on agriculture now face greater livelihood insecurity due to a slowdown in agricultural growth and inadequate investment in irrigation and extension services in rural regions, as well as a lack of affordable institutional financing. It was thought that the implementation of reforms, liberalization of international commerce, and corresponding pricing incentives would raise investment, make essential inputs more affordable, and increase agricultural output. A change in the terms of trade in favor of agriculture was also anticipated to boost agricultural exports and the growth rate (Ahluwalia 1994). Favorable terms of trade were anticipated to increase agricultural productivity and private investment in India (Misra 1998: 2105–09). Despite these hopes, policy changes made in the wake of economic reforms did not result in a faster pace of agricultural expansion. Economic liberalization involves several policies that are harmful to agriculture in particular as well as petty production in general. In that aspect, these laws discriminate against low-wage workers and the poor based on class. As a result of these policy initiatives, governmental funding for rural infrastructure, including irrigation systems and agricultural research and extension services, as well as the promotion of agricultural trade liberalization, has decreased. The impact of each of these measures on India's agriculture industry has been examined in this analysis.

N2  - Due to the trend of global warming, individuals from all walks of life have paid close attention to how climate change affects food security. China is a sizable nation with a rich climate and a diverse range of food crops that are of interest to researchers. Additionally, there is little mention of agricultural technology and farm irrigation facilities in academic research on climate change and agricultural economic growth in China. As a result, this study uses the SBM model, panel fixed effect model, and SYS-GMM model to examine the development trend of climate change and food security based on the panel data of Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2020. The study found that China has maintained an average annual growth rate of 4.3% in agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) in recent years, despite the impact of extreme weather. The average annual precipitation has a depressing influence on the TFP in agriculture, while the average annual temperature has the opposite effect. The farm irrigation facilities and agricultural technology’s moderating impact is mostly shown in how well they attenuate the impact of climate change on the TFP in agriculture. Food crops have thereby improved their ability to survive natural risks and attain higher yields as a result of advancements in agricultural technology and increasing investment in contemporary farm irrigation facilities. The study’s conclusions are used in the article to make the suggestion that strengthening climate change adaptation is necessary to ensure food security. The strategic policy of “storing grain in technology and storing grain in the soil” and the advancement of contemporary agricultural technology must be put into reality while the management system for grain reserves is being improved.

N2  - The study investigated risk perception, adoption of risk management instruments and the intensity of adoption among irrigated-rice farmers in the Upper East Region of Ghana. A multistage sampling technique was employed to draw 477 farmers for the study. The perception index, multivariate probit and Poisson regression models were used for the analysis. The results show that the perception index score was positive (0.43), which implies that farmers agreed that various types of risk (production, marketing and financial risks) affect their farming. It was found that the farmers combined diverse techniques to manage risk. All the farmers were using improved varieties and agrochemicals, yet none had any form of agricultural insurance. Also, farmers’ socio-demographic, farm-level, institutional, risk perceptions and environmental changes have a significant and heterogeneous effect on risk management practice. Particularly, gender, years of education, total farm size, rice farm size and soil fertility status significantly predict crop diversification. Gender, years of education, total farm size, rainfall prediction and soil fertility status are the determinants of off-farm work participation. Again, gender, age, years of education, farming experience, extension access, the land tenure system, total farm size, rice farm size and market risk explains farmers' credit uptake. The practice of crop rotation is influenced by gender, farming experience, access to extension services, the land tenure system, total farm size, market risk perception, and soil fertility status; whiles extension services predict engagement in contract farming. Also, the intensity of adopting risk management instruments is influenced by farmers' age, farming experience, the land tenure system, extension access, total farm size and erratic rainfall, heterogeneously. Further, market risk perceptions augment crop rotation and credit access adoption, validating the Protection Motivation Theory. We recommend that insurance companies develop strategies to ensure the uptake of the policies by farmers within the irrigation scheme. Also, investment in organisations like extension services, research centres, and ICOUR is crucial for development because it may persuade farmers to use the right risk management tools. Further, stakeholders should consider farmers' risk perception when designing risk management policies.

N2  - The current situation of water resources in Iran, the trend and trends governing it, as well as considering the inappropriate spatial and temporal distribution of water per capita and its excessive consumption, show the necessity of demand management. In this regard, improving the efficiency of water consumption, especially in the agricultural sector, is considered as an opportunity to save more water. Optimum water management requires a great change and to ensure the sustainability of these resources, integrated and systematic management should be applied in line with optimal processing and exploitation with the application of new technology for maximum utilization of these resources in planning. Improving the efficiency of water consumption has been introduced as one of the most important ways to reduce water consumption, but it can be seen that the aforementioned improvement does not necessarily reduce water consumption to the saved amount and sometimes leads to no change or even an increase in water consumption. only the use of new and efficient irrigation methods cannot be effective in adjusting the consumption and balancing the supply and demand of water. In explaining why water consumption has not decreased despite the large investment in the field of modern irrigation technology, the concept previously expressed in the field of energy consumption, i.e. the rebound effect, can be useful. The rebound effect, which is more prominent in the literature of energy economy, in the field of water, can be considered a mechanism that causes a part of the water saved due to the improvement of water efficiency to be reused and, as a result, leads to a reduction in the amount of water saved. In simpler terms, the return effect can be defined as a percentage of the potential water savings resulting from water efficiency improvement, which reflects the difference between the potential and actual savings in water consumption. The return effect is usually defined in relation to different forms of energy, such as fuel or electricity, but in this research, an attempt is made to investigate the return effect for agricultural water.

N2  - This paper provides a comparison of irrigation costs for four major crops in Bangladesh's northern area using diesel pump, grid-powered electric pump, and solar water pump methods of irrigation. Bangladesh, the world’s most densely populated country with a total population of about 168.3 million in 2022, constantly faces unrelenting challenges and problems due to energy shortages, stagnating socio-economic development, and industrial growth. As a result of climate change, energy and water resources will become scarce for agricultural production in the future. That is why the judicious use of energy and water is vital to the growth of the agricultural sector. Therefore, a pump is required to extract water from deep underground to where it is needed. For this reason, water pumps have been around for decades. Four different types of crops have been the focus of the investigation. All the information on the amount of water used for those crops was gathered. Then, three distinct types of pumps (solar, diesel, and electric) with the same power rating, or 4 hp, were selected. Besides, the obtained water volumes were utilized to compute the precise area covered for various crops. Finally, the costs for three years in BDT was computed. According to the study, solar-powered irrigation costs more than grid-powered irrigation for all crops since the latter requires a significant initial outlay and investment. The analysis showed that, for the irrigation of four crops, solar-powered irrigation is much more profitable than diesel-powered irrigation. This paper reviews the current rice, potato, wheat and maize production situation in northern region of Bangladesh; various irrigation schemes; current energy levels; and government policies and measures to promote solar irrigation. A proposed model has been overviewed in rural Bangladesh with various configurations of sustainable solar irrigation systems, commercial PV arrays, motors, pumps, and charge controller technologies used in solar irrigation systems

N2  - Point and nonpoint wastewater sources have a detrimental, negative effect on agriculture, soil, surface, and groundwater supplies. In this research, a wastewater treatment system made up of a sedimentation tank, a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW), a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland (VF-CW), and a storage tank was proposed, designed, and cost estimated. Small populations in underdeveloped nations with dry and semi-arid climates can use the treatment system as an affordable construction, maintenance, and operational solution for wastewater treatment. The system will protect agricultural lands and groundwater from pollution. The system can service 6000 capita and has a wastewater discharge of 780 m3/d in the developing arid region in El-Moghra Oasis western desert of Egypt, where the 1.5 million acres used for the land reclamation project based on groundwater irrigation. The relaxed tanks in a series model based on the areal loading rates and background pollutants concentrations (P-K-C*) was utilized to size the HSSF and VF-CWs. The results indicated that the HSSF-CW design treatment surface area was 2375 m2, and the hydraulic surface loading (q) and hydraulic retention time (RT) were 0.33 m/d and 0.55 d, respectively, and utilizing Phragmites australis and Papyrus for the biological treatment. The expected overall cumulative removal efficiencies were 96.7, 70, and 100% for the biological oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphors (TP), and fecal coliforms (FC), respectively. The VF-CW indicates that there was a 2193 m2 design treatment surface area, q = 0.36 m/d, and RT of 0.63 d. The expected BOD, TP, and FC removal efficiencies were 75, 33.3, and 92.7%, respectively. In order to simplify the design stages and the cost estimation, design and investment cost curves were established for a population range from 500 to 9000. The total monthly water loss due to evapotranspiration for the HSSF and VF-CWs indicates a range from 3.7 to 8.5%, respectively. The total investment cost analysis for the proposed system corresponding to 780 m3/d wastewater discharge of indicates a total investment cost of EUR 146,804 and EUR 24.46/per-capita equivalent (P.E). This approach can be used by decision makers in the Mediterranean region and Middle Eastern countries to improve the water quality using social and economic criteria, leading to the effective implementation of ecological restoration projects as a low-cost treatment system and adding a nonconventional water source that can be used in irrigation.

N2  - In the globalizing world, the importance of energy is increasing day by day. Countries can make investment plans within the analysis of production and consumption data for electrical energy. In this study, sectoral electricity consumption data (State Agency, Industrial Enterprise, Business, Residence, Agricultural Irrigation, Street Lighting) in Turkey were analyzed with statistical techniques. Using the sectoral data between 2000 and 2020, the consumption data for the next 5 years was estimated via Cubic Regression Analysis. The success of the Cubic Regression models was evaluated with the success criteria of MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error), RMSE (Square Root Mean Errors), and R2 (Coefficient of Determination). In addition, the OneWay ANOVA technique was used in the study to make sector comparisons for electricity consumption data. It was investigated whether there was a significant difference between the averages of the sector groups, the suitability of variance was examined and the Tamhane T2 test, one of the Pairwise Comparison Tests (Post Hoc), was used. As a result, in this study, electricity consumption data was analyzed with different statistical techniques, and information was produced for both current and future periods.

N2  - Yam production is heavily reliant on rainfall. Whilst some farmers plant from January to March before the onset of rains, others plant after the onset of rains in April. The impact of planting time on land productivity of puna yam (Dioscorea rotundata) was assessed using endogenous switching regression. Primary data was collected from yam farmers in the Oti Region of Ghana. The study revealed that planting of yam in April after onset of rains increases land productivity of puna yam. Aside planting time, capital investment, labour, less crowding of seed yams, planting on freshly raised mounds and extension contact enhance puna yam productivity. Therefore, farmers should plant puna yam in April after the onset of rains to obtain higher land productivity. Lastly, extension service intensification and access to weather information should be promoted to enhance yam productivity.

N2  - Advancement of canal irrigation without adequate drainage provision led to twin problems of waterlogging and sodic soil formation in parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Continuous seepage of water from the canal increased the water table of the adjoining fields, induced upward movement of salts on the surface soil and the land become salt-affected (sodic soil). After realising benefits for some years, the negative externalities offset the positive impact of the canal irrigation system in terms of crop losses (45 and 62 per cent for rice and wheat) and severely affecting the livelihoods for the farmers adjacent to the canal area. Several efforts were made to restore such degraded land through conventional methods of gypsum-based reclamation, intercept drainage through perforated pipe lines and bio-drainage belt but could not found successful enough to provide positive return to investment. Finally, the land engineering option, the land modification technique was evolved in which the excess seepage water was harvested and used for crop and fish cultivation. Soil and water quality improved and diversified crops were possible to grow on this land. The socioeconomic evaluation in terms of financial feasibility, suitability to land holdings pattern and sustainability of this model was assessed. The model was techno-economically sustainable, however, challenged by few socio-economic constraints, which can be addressed through appropriate policy measures.

N2  - Climate change has severely impacted the rain-fed agricultural production system which is dominant in Nepal. This situation demands implementable strategies like supplemental irrigation for mitigating adverse impacts. In spite of the importance of supplemental irrigation, it is not adopted on a wider scale. Hence, this paper aims to assess perceptions of climate change and identify factors that influence the adoption of supplemental irrigation practices. Climate change impact survey data for Province No. 1 (one of the seven provinces in Nepal) with a sample of 800 households were analyzed by using the probit regression model. The results showed that the majority of the farmers perceived increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, resulting in climate-induced disasters such as drought. Similarly, only about 27% of the households have adopted supplemental irrigation practices. The significant factors influencing the adoption of supplemental irrigation practices were the household head’s number of years of farming experience and education level, distance to motorable roads, operational size of landholding, membership in community-based organizations, and the perception of changes in summer temperature. Considering the empirical results, it is necessary to undertake research on sustainable practices and develop support measures for scaling up this practice as the adoption of this practice is very low in Province No. 1. The policy and strategy should also emphasize enhancing the capacity of farmers in technical and managerial aspects of supplemental irrigation practices, raising awareness about climate change and its impact, and strengthening community-based organizations for sharing and exchanging knowledge and skills. In addition, creating additional employment opportunities to enhance the income of the farmers for mitigating the capital constraint and increasing investment in infrastructures like roads for improving physical access thereby promoting adoption.

N2  - Agricultural land use and practices have important implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. It is, therefore, important to develop methods of monitoring and quantifying the extent of crop types and cropping practices. A machine learning approach using random forest classification was applied to Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite imagery and satellite-derived phenological statistics to map crop types in the Mekong River Delta, enabling levels of rice intensification to be identified. This initial classification differentiated between broad and prevalent crop types, including perennial tree crops, rice, other vegetation, oil palm and other crops. A two-step classification was used to classify rice seasonality, whereby the areas identified as rice in the initial classification were further classified into single, double, or triple-cropped rice in a subsequent classification with the same input data but different training polygons. Both classifications had an overall accuracy of approximately 96% when cross-validated on test data. Radar bands from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 reflectance bands were important predictors of crop type, perhaps due to their capacity to differentiate between periodically flooded rice fields and perennial tree cover, which were the predominant classes in the Delta. On the other hand, the Start of Season (SoS) and End of Season (EoS) dates were the most important predictors of single, double, or triple-cropped rice, demonstrating the efficacy of the phenological predictors. The accuracy and detail are limited by the availability of reliable training data, especially for tree crops in small-scale orchards. A preliminary result is presented here, and, in the future, efficient collection of ground images may enable cost-effective training data collection for similar mapping exercises.

N2  - Natural occurrence of streams, rivers and flowing water attract emergence of urban housing along river bank is to tap water for domestic, irrigation, industrial use; deposition of minerals and nutrients for agricultural purpose. Consequences caused by recent events of floods in the urban centers are not limited to socio-economic, environmental loss but also increase in health challenges with loss of life. Flood itself cannot be held responsible for the catastrophe but the activities of people, society and urban housing encroaching on natural space of lowland, wetland, prone areas, also; landscape reshape to reclaim beaches by cutting off hills fosters thereafter, destruction of life and property. The study therefore identified the consequences of urban housing flood in three areas. Quantitative method including frequency tables, histograms, pairwise ranking, chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were also used to interpret the data collected. The result shows that disease occurrence is significant to urban housing flood; correlation between flood and marginalization to adequate housing quality; and floods is significant to urban housing development. It is clear that vulnerable and flooded prone milieu is mostly occupied by urban poor because of inability to avoid good housing quality and there is high of cases of cholera, malarial, water-borne, measles among residents in the study area. Society is becoming more aware that floods can be controlled to a limited extent; hence, safety against floods must be sought for, to prevent loss of life, properties and socio-economic investment. This paper recommends absolute delineation from vulnerable area, government and property developers should ensure good housing quality, total relocation of urban housing from marginal land and compensation to victims. Studies on comparative evaluation of urban housing vulnerability to flood on highland and lowland; environmental disruption of urban housing in lowland require additional investigation.

T1  - Prospects for Yield Gains in High-Yielding Cropping Systems
A1  - Rizzo Ayphassorho, Gonzalo Dario
Y1  - 2022///
N2  - Increasing food demand, rapid climate warming, and the concerns about environmental impact of agriculture will require improved agronomic management and policies during the next decades. Novel approaches to identifying causes of the yield gap are needed to increase the effectiveness of agricultural research and development (AR&D) programs and accelerate the generation and transfer of knowledge. This project combines case studies in two countries where proper prioritization of AR&D is key to meeting crop production goals towards the year 2050. The first case study presents an approach that combines farmer data and crop modeling to disentangle the contribution of climate, agronomic and genetic technologies to maize yield gain in irrigated environments in United States (U.S.). The second case study developed a farmer data-driven approach for prioritization of AR&D at a national level in the cereal-based systems in Indonesia. Subsequently, the extent of yield limitation due to potassium deficiencies over the most important rice and maize producing areas of Indonesia were further investigated by applying an approach that combined farmer survey data, in-situ foliar nutrient status diagnosis, data from a long-term fertility experiment, and a collection of data from on-farm fertility trials. High-yielding irrigated maize in the U.S. showed a linear yield gain of 186 kg ha-1 y-1 with climate representing 49% of the estimated yield gain, followed by agronomic practices represented (39%), and a marginal contribution of improved genetics (13%). In intensive rice-maize systems in Indonesia there was a discrepancy between local researchers' and extensionists' perceptions of the most important on-farm yield constraints versus the ones objectively detected. Partial nutrient balances estimated based on survey data and leaf tissue analyses showed a widespread potassium deficiency in rice and maize. Long-term experiments showed a low yield response to potassium over time compared to the yield response to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer additions. On-farm fertility trials showed low yield and net profit increases due to potassium fertilizer addition, leading to low return on investment which prevents the generalized adoption of this technology.

Y1  - 2022///
N2  - The sustainability of irrigated agriculture has been questioned both economically and environmentally. Evaluation of the performance of irrigation schemes helps to know the present status of the scheme and to apply possible measures for improvement. Irrigation scheme performance assessment is vital to evaluate the impacts of irrigation practices, to identify performance gaps and to improve system performances. However, the performance of Kitamewukia Small Scale Irrigation schemes was not assessed since its operation. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the water delivery, on-farm water management and organizational performances of irrigation schemes. To undertake this study primary collected through field measurements and secondary data were collected from the secondary sources. CROPWAT 8.0 model and GIS software were used to analyze the data. The result of this study revealed that, average conveyance efficiencies 89.11 % and 83.48%, respectively, for lined and unlined main canals and the mean conveyance loss 0.05 (l/s/m) and 0.07 (l/s/m) for lined and unlined main canals. The application and storage efficiency was, respectively, 54.2% and 50.2%. Analyses of water-use showed that relative water supply and relative irrigation supply were 1.8 and 2.4 respectively. Output per unit irrigated area values of 63821.3ETB/ha was calculated at irrigation scheme. Furthermore, the output per unit command area of scheme is 79327.6ETB/ha. Water productivity factors such as, Output per unit irrigation water supplied and Output per unit water consumed values of 14.54ETB/m 3 , 15.4ETB/m 3 in irrigation scheme were calculated, respectively. The result of the physical indicators, which were irrigation ratio and sustainability of irrigated area, were found to be 0.80 and 1. Around 54.9% of gross return on investment was obtained. Unfair distribution of water was due to water scarcity and illegal water users as the beneficiaries responded. Generally, the scheme requires improvement measures. The overall efficiencies of irrigation scheme were found to be 43.3%. Keywords: efficiency, external factors, internal factors, conveyance efficiency and loss.

N2  - Drought has a profound impact on crop yield and the subsistence farming economy in arid and semi-arid lands of developing countries. It creates insecurity in the food supply and livelihood of rural farmers, leading to different livelihood trajectories and transformations. However, a primary challenge is to examine the complexity and location-specificity of drought impact. This study proposes a conceptual framework to understand the integrated drought impact on Yuzhong County in Gansu Province, China. Specifically, the study applies the standardized precipitation index at different time scales to observe drought changes from 1960 to 2017 and estimates the correlation with crop yield. Then, farmers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Yuzhong County were categorized using two-step cluster analysis, based on survey data collected from 1013 interviews conducted in the three regions. The study explores the impact of drought on the livelihood and food security of different clusters of farmers and analyzes their livelihood trajectories and transformations. The results showed that the drastic years with moderate and severe droughts were 1981–1983, 1997, and 2011–2012. Drought was significantly correlated with crop yield, and the effect of SPI12 was more severe. Five clusters of farmers in the southern regions of Yuzhong county were affected by drought with large drought disaster areas and serious economic losses, leading to high rates of affordability deficit and food insecurity, especially in the southern region. As a result, farmers have been adapting their livelihoods to drought, transforming toward mixed livelihoods in the northern region and part-time agricultural livelihoods in the central and southern regions. This study recommends an increase in public investment in water conservancy and irrigation facilities and suggests that locations and policies be utilized to promote the transformation of farmers’ livelihoods to make them more resilient.

N2  - Approaches to assessment of the economic effectiveness of restoring drainage systems in the humid zone of Ukraine are substantiated. A conceptual scheme has been developed that determines the stages of evaluation, sources of the input array of information, strategic orientation, and invariance of restoration projects, provides for considering a number of risks and limitations of a systemic and non-systemic nature when evaluating the project effectiveness of strategic alternatives. The basis of the evaluation is the results of the analysis of materials regarding the technical condition of drainage systems, the restoration of which in the drainage area is carried out according to two options: modernization of working (on an area of 1311,2 thousand ha) and restoration of non-working (on an area of 1962,9 thousand ha) drainage systems. In the calculations of restoration (modernization) costs, the results of a preliminary assessment of the cost of restoration work for various types of drainage systems (drainage, drainage-humidification, polder, and water circulation systems) were used based on the reduced costs for restoration of the intra-farm and inter-farm network, which were adopted in the "Strategy of Irrigation and Drainage ..." [27]. The economic indicators of the production of agricultural crops economically attractive to farming producers (grain corn, sunflower, rapeseed, soybean) were calculated under the conditions of their production before and after the implementation of the project of restoration (modernization) of drainage systems. The application of the traditional scheme for projected indicators calculating, at which the discount rate was defined as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is substantiated. Taking into account the specifics of drainage system restoration (modernization) projects and their duration, the weighted average rates for long-term loans and deposits (risk-free) for legal entities, taking into account the inflation component and the value of equity capital of agro-industrial complex enterprises, were chosen as the discount rate for the preliminary pre-investment analysis. Based on the calculation of the project effectiveness of the restoration (modernization) of drainage systems using the scenario approach according to the consolidated option for determining the payback of investment costs, it is proved that the options at the discount rates r1 (for 2021) and r2 (for the beginning of 2022), as well as the discount rate for the equity scheme, they give positive indicators of the investment project, which indicates the expediency of its implementation and economic efficiency. The internal rate of return for the three options shows a sufficient margin of safety (24–26%). The most economically expedient is the option with a source of financing from the equity capital of agro-industrial complex enterprises, for which the non-discounted (RR) and discounted (DPP) payback terms are 3,4 and 4,7 years, respectively.

N2  - This study was conducted using the emergy analysis approach in wheat production systems in order to plan and manage the major challenges facing the Sistan region's wheat production. All inputs for wheat production, the most important crop in the region, were assessed in this study. These inputs include renewable inputs, such as sunlight, wind, and rain; nonrenewable inputs, such as soil erosion; and purchased inputs and services, such as machinery, fossil fuels, electricity, labor, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and chemical fertilizers. According to the results of the study, the total emergy production of wheat was 1.061016 sej ha-1. The irrigation water consumed the most energy at 28.96%, followed by nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers at 20.75 and 16.5%, respectively. The emergy yield ratio index was 1.41, the emergy investment ratio index was 2.4, the environmental loading ratio was 2.41, and the emergy sustainability index was 0.585, which indicates the average sustainability and environmental load of this system relative to other researchers' reports. By increasing input efficiency by optimizing the consumption of irrigation water, nitrogen fertilizer, and phosphorus fertilizer, this production system can be made more sustainable and less taxing on the environment.

N2  - Baseline and endline data for control and treatment communities in an RCT evaluation of the Watershared scheme. The Rio Grande catchment in the eastern Bolivian Andes plays an important role by providing irrigation and drinking water services to villages, towns and cities downstream. However, deforestation and extensive cattle ranching due to unsustainable agricultural practices along the rivers adversely affect ecosystem services. In 2011, a Bolivian NGO, Fundación Natura Bolivia (known as Natura), launched a Payment for Watershed Services-like scheme aiming at connecting ecosystem service users (Municipal Government, Water Cooperatives and downstream villages) with services providers (upstream farmers and cattle-ranchers). Known as Watershared internationally and Acuerdos Reciprocos por Agua (Reciprocal Watershed Agreement) within Bolivia, the scheme is based on an in-kind contribution (beehives, fruit seedlings, irrigation tubing, barbed wire and other similar products) paid by downstream water-users (with additional support from Natura’s international donors) to upstream small holder farmers ranging from $1 to 10/year/hectare (with an additional joining incentive of $100). The aim is to support farmers reducing the impact of unsustainable agriculture practices on watershed ecosystems. The scheme emphasizes reciprocal relationships over market-based incentives. Because of Natura’s interest in how this novel scheme would work and its potential to deliver benefits, they took the highly unusual steps of setting the project up as a Randomised Control Trial (with support from the UK-government’s Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation programme and technical input from Harvard University). Baseline studies were carried out before the implementation of the project in 2010 in 2623 households in 129 villages in the area. This included surveys on water quality, biodiversity and (most relevant to this data archive) a socio-economic survey. Data from the socio-economic survey was used to stratify communities into Control or Intervention and only households in the 65 intervention communities were offered the intervention when the scheme was rolled out in 2011. In 2015/2016 an endline survey was carried out, again with support from a grant from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation programme. This time Bangor University also played a large role through a project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The aim was to use the baseline survey, and the randomized trial to evaluate the impacts of the Watershared scheme on farmer livelihoods and environmental sustainability. The endline reached a total of 1694 of the initial baseline (plus 57 additional hosueholds). Research funders: The baseline data (2010) was collected under a grant from espa (Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation) to Fundacion Natura Bolivia (PI Nigel Asquith) “What types of investment can most cost-effectively ensure ecosystem service provision? A randomized program evaluation” (NE/I00436X/1) The endline data (2015/2016) was collected with funding from two projects: an espa funded project to Fundacion Natura Bolivia (PI Nigel Asquith) “Under what conditions can Payments for Environmental Services deliver sustainable improvements in welfare? Learning from a Randomized Control Trial” (NE/L001470/1) and a Leverhulme Trust funded research project to Bangor University (PI Julia Jones) “Can payment for ecosystem services deliver environmental and livelihood benefits” (RPG-2014-056).

T1  - Urban Agriculture: Evaluation and Assessment of Urban Farming and Food Production in Raleigh, NC
A1  - Houck, Elizabeth
Y1  - 2022///
N2  - Food production has shaped the American landscape and the environment beginning with the early native populations and expanding in scale with the first settlers. Along with shelter, the most important necessity for sustaining life is a source of food and water. In the past, tribes and communities moved across the landscape in the search of food, whether it was to hunt with animal migration patterns or gather seasonal fruits, berries, and nuts. This type of forage enabled diversity of food in the diet and allowed food sources to be sustainable and accessible. As populations grew and families migrated to other territories, the demand for staple and livestock feeder crops, such as corn and wheat, created development of mono-culture cropland environments and in areas that were un-sustainable for reliable growth without large irrigation systems. These corporate food production operations replaced family-run farms. A quote from an urban gardener in Atlanta “Those who control the food, control you” places the reality of our current food production and distribution methods into question. Food shortages occur when natural weather conditions due to climate change factors affect the distribution, production, and human interventions of the supply chain. Limited market locations and increased prices reduce availability of healthy foods in communities. Food deserts and food refugees are the result when disturbance to food distribution chains and resource scarcity occur. There has been a widening gap between food supply and demand in developed and developing countries. The demand for food, energy and water has increased and they are strongly interlinked. This report will provide an overview of the benefits and limitations of urban farming technologies which provide food to communities in urban areas or areas with disproportionate access to food. The types of innovative urban food production methods will be compared including design considerations, community relationships, investment and infrastructure, location requirements for accessibility and potential environmental effects. The goal of urban farming is to make cities and communities more resilient and less dependent on outside resources for food. Evaluations of existing urban gardening projects in Raleigh, North Carolina, will be included in this report documenting community involvement, production, distribution and space availability and other successful community gardening projects. There should be an understanding of planning policies and opportunities in the community. Existing data from the impacts to food security, water management, biodiversity, economic and environment advantages for planning and investment in the community are to be documented annually for continued financial and community support. Important steps for the development of urban farming include gaining support from local businesses and governments that may provide incentives to help local economics, social systems, and communities with the unifying attributes of urban agricultural oriented projects. This assessment of innovative agriculture examples and designs may supply the guide to help urban planning and city leaders to understand the diverse goals for urban food production projects in the community.

N2  - A sufficient supply of ecosystem services (ESs) in agriculture provides the basis for human sustainable development. Intensified large-scale farming has changed wetland ecosystems extensively by reducing both the resilience and capacity to support production of many ESs. Small-scale farming may also affect the generation of ESs where the impact often reflects the differences in farming practices. This paper explores the supply and demand of the ESs between management practices, irrigated and rainfed, of smallholder farmers in Kilombero wetland, Tanzania. We conducted interviews involving 30 households and two focus groups with five discussants for each practice, rainfed and irrigation. Generally, we found that the need for ES, especially food, water and flood control, in both farming practices, were exceeding the capacity to supply. In general, irrigation farming compared to rainfed farming was associated with higher levels of food production, increasing flood regulation and erosion control. However, the ES delivery and need were not uniform depending on the river discharge. The differences in supply and demand of ESs between farming practices suggest that society would benefit from investing in irrigation and regulatory infrastructures to minimize flooding risk and to build up the ecosystem’s natural capacity to produce services. Such practical policy-relevant measures could balance the gap between supply and demand of ESs in smallholder farming systems in Tanzanian wetland.

N2  - Phosphorus (P) rates and its date of application is considered some of the most important factor affecting crop growth, yield and nutritive value in Egyptian clover. Two field experiments were conducted at Sids Agriculture Research Station, Bani Sweif Governorate. ARC, Egypt, during the winter growing seasons of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 to study the impact of use different rates and date of phosphorus applications on growth parameters, forage yield and quality in Egyptian clover (var. Giza 6). The experimental treatments were arranged in a split plot design with three replicates. The main plots represented three different rates of phosphorus(A1=100, A2=150 and A3=200 kg fed-1 superphosphate), whereas the sub-plots included the three dates of phosphorus applications (B1= one dose before planting, B2= two equal doses before planting and the second before first irrigation and B3= two equal doses one before first irrigation and the second before second irrigation). The main obvious results of this study could be summarized as follows; the rates of phosphorus applications had a significant effect on all traits under study of clover crop and maximum values were obtained with A3 treatment but it was on a par with A2 treatment. On the contrary, minimum values for the corresponding respective characters were recorded with A1 treatment. It could be stated that all traits were gradually increased due to applying the assessed rates of phosphorus. Whilst, in case of the dates of phosphorus application, data indicated that B2 treatment were superior compared with the other treatments for all traits. The highest values of interaction were obtained with A3 treatment and B2 treatment for growth parameters, yield and quality. Besides that, a feasibility study proved that Egyptian clover is economically advisable under treatment (200 kg fed-1 ) superphosphate added at two equal doses the first before planting and the second before first irrigation, where the maximum total revenue, net return and net return per one invested recorded (37705.5, 26185.5, 2.27 L.E.), respectively. In nutshell, optimization of P fertilization and attention to the time of addition improves the productivity and quality of the forage in Egyptian clover.

N2  - Irrigation is considered as an important means to enhance agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the prevalent energy poverty in the region hampers the development of the irrigated agriculture, and there is great interest in investing in solar energy to overcome the barrier. While the solar energy has many advantages over traditional energy solutions, such as diesel irrigation, its performance is weather sensitive and could be susceptible to climate change. We present a study to evaluate the impact of climate change on cost effectiveness of solar irrigation relative to diesel irrigation under latest CMIP6 scenario. In the study, we sized the solar and diesel irrigation system according to climate and hydrogeological conditions and compared the life-cycle costs of the two systems. The analysis shows that in most regions of Sub-Saharan Africa climate change will improve the relative cost-effectiveness of solar irrigation versus diesel irrigation. This result helps justify the investment in solar irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa.

N2  - The variable rate application of production inputs is a method used by row crop producers to save money and resources. However, this technology comes at a substantial investment cost. This includes the capital investment in the physical equipment and the intellectual investment in managing and operating these advanced technologies. We focus our analysis on precision agriculture for irrigation through the adoption of a variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. We establish the useful life of the equipment, salvage value, and total capital investment necessary for adoption. This allows us to determine a fixed cost of adoption and breakeven yield requirement at various commodity prices to cover investment and annual expenses. We further illustrate through a case study of a farm in north Alabama the potential yield gains from the use of a VRI system during 2018-2021. This analysis provides producers with the framework to evaluate the economic feasibility of adopting these technologies for their row crop operation. It further provides the foundation for future analysis of the economic feasibility of adoption of VRI in Alabama.

T1  - Essays on village development in rural Thailand
A1  - Nantajit, Chompunuch
Y1  - 2022///
N2  - The process of development is accompanied by urbanization through shifting labor from agriculture to the industrial and service sector. Thus, rural villages in developing countries, where most agriculture takes place, are often seen as a place unattractive for work and living. Especially younger people seek employment in the cities where they find better infrastructure and more leisure possibilities. Left behind in the villages are often the elderly and minors. Most of the development investments are made in urban agglomerates while villages are given lower priority. Hence, the role of rural villages is often underrated in developing countries and therefore some villages remain pockets of poverty. Considering the experience of many European countries with well-targeted rural development policies, villages can become modernized and they can become an attractive living place with low prices for land and a better environment than in polluted cities. Hence, there is a need to study the role that rural villages can play in economic development of an emerging market country like Thailand. Therefore, this thesis takes an in-depth look at the mechanism, constraints and opportunities that govern socioeconomic development of rural villages in Thailand. The dissertation contains four essays. Each essay deals with a different aspect of the development of rural villages. The first essay is based on panel data from a single village, and tests, by means of two econometric models, the standard assumption that out-migration is a driver for increase in welfare and reducing poverty in villages. The second paper, using the same village than in the first paper applies a mathematical programming model to investigate the future role of agriculture under two likely external economic scenarios. The third article takes a broader view, by using a sample of 220 villages in Northeast Thailand, and explores the factors that on the one hand, can facilitate transformation from backward to progressive rural villages and that on the other hand, can hinder modernization and development. The fourth essay is focused on villages along the Mekong River in both, Thailand and Laos and presents an account of the impact of the recent Covid-19 pandemic on Mekong villages. The results of the four essays can be summarized as follows. Firstly, against the hypotheses suggested by the theory of migration, migration was not a significant factor driving income growth in the village. In-migration exceeded out-migration and business investment in the village was a major driver of income growth. Secondly, while income growth was well in line with Thailand’s national rate of economic growth, inequality has risen and poverty decline was minimal, much behind the aggregate rate of poverty decline in the country. In addition, household debt on average has more doubled between 2009 and 2018. Thirdly, households who diversified into wage and self-employment experienced better progress in terms of income growth and were less likely to be poor, compared to households whose primary occupation was farming. While all village households are engaged in farming, income from agriculture is not the only source of household income, i.e. majority of households are following a multiple income, part-time farming system. Results of a village-level, positive mathematical programming model showed that even drastic price increases in maize, which is the main agricultural commodity of the village, will not reverse the trend away from agriculture and towards a more diversified livelihood strategy. On the other hand, households are not likely to give up farming altogether in the foreseeable future. Fourthly, using panel data of 220 villages between 2007 and 2017, results of the descriptive and the model analysis demonstrate the importance of infrastructure investment in the development of rural villages in North East Thailand. On average of all the villages, poverty has been halved and household income has doubled. Key infrastructures are good quality roads, significantly related to basically all welfare parameters. Agricultural productivity growth is facilitated by improvements in irrigation infrastructure. A major infrastructure is improvements in telecommunication which is still emerging but was found to be crucial for a modernization of the village economy. However, progress in this area is lagging behind the advances made in urban areas. Finally, the paper describing the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic in villages along the Mekong River in Northeast Thailand and Laos, showed that while the economic impact of Covid-19 in rural villages was minimal, the pandemic has exposed the weakness of rural economies in the Mekong villages under lockdown conditions and due to their past threats from the exploitation of the river as a source of hydropower. This makes it even harder for these villages to cope with other ongoing processes such as climate change and natural resource depletion. In conclusion, the studies of rural villages in Thailand have opened up a new perspective of development for emerging market economies. It also provides an entry point to a policy debate for a new rural development policy. Such policy should recognize the opportunities that exist in rural villages as a means of inclusive economic growth and not, as in the past, just as a source of cheap labor for urban development.

N2  - This research examines the role of micro-irrigation systems, i.e., sprinkler and drip irrigation, on date palm production and quality in a semi-arid region. The field experiment was carried out for two successful seasons at a private farm, in the Al-Nubaria region of Egypt. The date palm was planted under pressurized irrigation (drip irrigation and mini-sprinkler irrigation) to investigate the effect of both irrigation systems and three water treatments (100, 80, and 60% from ETc) on the yield and quality of date palms. Results on the productivity of date palm yields showed that the yield of date palm under a drip-irrigation system with 80% of crop water demand was an equal match to the yield of the sprinkler-irrigated date palm with 100% of crop water demand. This reflects the high efficiency of the drip irrigation system compared to the sprinkler irrigation system in date palms, especially in the semi-arid region. The results showed a significant increase in productivity by increasing water applied from 60% up to 80 and 100%. Quality attributes of date palm (particularly, sucrose, purity, and extractable sugar %) have a rise with increasing water deficit. The results have numerous implications, especially for sustainable investment in date palms. Implications for three aspects of sustainable investment, economic, social, and environmental, are discussed.

N2  - Background and objectives: Surface irrigation is the most common method of irrigation. over 80% of agricultural lands in Iran are irrigated by this method. Generally, this technique, has lower investment and energy requirements than pressurized irrigation methods. Many efforts are applied to improve the economic output of water use and to preserve the environment in Iran. Modifying the design and management parameters at the farm level, can improve the performance of irrigation systems. The main objective of this study, is to optimize surface irrigation efficiency, with low-cost tools, using a simulation model. Materials and methods: The study areas were selected fields of Molla-Sani region in Khuzestan province, located in southwest of Iran. Field experiments were carried out in two fields, irrigated using a surface irrigation system. Three irrigation events and three plots (as repeats) were applied per field. Experiments were conducted on the three borders of 150 m length, 7 m width, and 0.125 % slope, in Field 1, and on three borders of 200 m in length, 7 m width, and 0.1 % slope, in Field 2. The inflow rates of 25 and 35 L/s were applied in the fields 1 and 2. Inflow rate was checked using a W.S.C flume. The borders were divided into parts of 10 m distances to measure the advance and recession times. The best combination of parameters was determined with the simulation model. The objective function (OF) including the application efficiency and the distribution uniformity was applied to optimize the irrigation performance. Results: This study showed that, based on simulation model, changing the inflow rate, has no effect on the best value of objective function. The optimal inflow rate and cut-off time are recommended as 35 L/s and 30 min in a border with length of 50 m, in the Field 1, and, the best performance in the Field 2, are obtained from the inflow rate of 20 L/s and the cut-off time of 48 min and length of 50 m. Field experiments showed that, the difference of infiltration rates, were not significant, during this study. Based on the data obtained from three events, in both fields, and analyzed via the simulation model, the average NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error) index values for the evaluation of the advance curves were 12.7, 12.5, and 11.6%, while of the recession curves were 6.9, 6.8, and 6.6%. Conclusion: The pressurized irrigation has the high investment and energy requirements than surface irrigation. Furthermore, the evaporation rate is much, in the research region. Because of the inflow rate and cutoff time are the most effective parameters in improving irrigation, thus, in this region, prediction and selection of the optimum combination of cut-off time and inflow rate are the low-cost tools to improve the surface irrigation performance compared to modifying length and slope in border irrigation or transform of surface to pressurized system, in the farm level.

The main data collection tool was a questionnaire, data collection method, documentary study, and interview, and the study population of this study included all farmers who installed a pressurized irrigation system in their fields between 2015 and the end of 2018 (N=477), which was determined based on Krejcie and Morgan sampling table with a sample size of 214 people. In addition to dispersion and centrality statistics, coefficient of variation and confirmatory factor analysis were utilized to assess and explain the data. Farmers' opinions of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the implementation of a pressurized irrigation system were investigated in this study. The findings revealed that farmers' average perceptions in these three aspects were higher than normal (The average of each dimension is higher than 3). The most important social consequences of adopting pressured irrigation systems, according to the respondents, are "reducing rural migration", "creating a sense of constructive competition among farmers to use these systems", and "sustainability and continuity of agricultural jobs in the region, as well as hope for the future of agriculture". "Optimal water usage management", "quantitative enhancement of agricultural productivity", and "enhanced farm investment" are among the most important economic consequences. "The prospect of uniform distribution of production inputs through reservoirs" was one of the most significant environmental impacts.

N2  - Shocks such as Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters erode the resilience of many poor households against hunger by further threatening productive capacities. It is projected that over 690 million people around the world went hungry in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing the vulnerabilities and insufficiencies of global food systems. Food security is a human right and the government of South Africa is legally bound by the constitution to ensure food security for all. However, food insecurity in the country is owing to insufficient access to food because of structural poverty and inequality dynamics with a strong racial footprint rather than a shortage of food. Additionally, the rising cost of living, limited investment in agricultural development, and high dependency ratios especially in low-income households are some of the factors contributing to food insecurity in the country. Consequently, household-level food security is a major challenge to the South African government and policymakers. The government has strong social and economic rights commitments in place to achieve this goal and improve the lives of rural communities that are dependent on agriculture as a source of livelihood. Using household survey data, the study seeks to investigate the role played by cash transfers on household productive capacities and food security status within the context of a small pace of transition from homestead to irrigated farming in the former homelands of the Eastern Cape Province. The lower bound poverty line of R 758 (on average $57 USD), was used to determine household food security status. Simple random sampling was employed to select 158 respondents. The propensity score matching method was employed using the Nearest Neighbour and Kernel matching techniques to estimate the treatment effects and compare the outcomes of participation in irrigation farming and receipts of cash transfers in comparison with the non-irrigators. Both matching methods revealed that irrigation farming enhanced the per capita food expenditure by at least ZAR 2 738.88 and ZAR 2 790.37, which then improves household food security. The findings also revealed that cash transfers increase the farmers’ production activities by ZAR 1 467.90 and ZAR 1 478.00. Evidently, the cash transfers necessitate the purchase of more and improved production inputs and access to climate-smart practices such as irrigation, which then improves irrigators’ production capacities and, as a result, reduces vulnerability and improves livelihoods and food security.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a simple methodology to select a limited number of geographical areas to prioritize for commodity-specific investments in Uganda. Similar to other approaches for prioritizing investments geographically, the basic idea behind the proposed method is that districts with high agro-ecological potential, that are also far from their potential and have high levels of poverty, should be prioritized for commodity-specific investments as they are where investments are likely to have the highest impact. The methodology then proposes an iterative elimination algorithm to provide a list of suggested districts that rank high in all dimensions.The results highlight that prioritized districts are very context and commodity specific. In certain cases (e.g. sugar cane or millet), prioritized districts tend to be highly concentrated in one geographical region, whereas they tend to be more spread out for the sectors producing other commodities (i.e. bananas, coffee, goats, cassava and maize). The results are expected to inform a discussion with policymakers in Uganda which is expected to culminate in the selection of an even narrower set of districts for which more in-depth analyses of commodity-specific investments will be undertaken at the level of priority areas, including, among others, irrigation, mechanization, seeds and fertilizers.

N2  - Analyzing cultivated land input behavior (CLIB) at the scale of rural households links with cultivated land-use efficiency (CLUE), this study examined the Yimeng Mountain area in northern China, supported by field survey data from 737 rural households. This research systematically analyzed the characteristics of CLIB of different types of rural households, measured the CLUE of different types of rural households by using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, and explored the influence of CLIB on CLUE based on the Tobit regression model. The results show (1) significant differences in the characteristics of the CLIB of different types of rural households in the Yimeng Mountain area. Among them, the highest land, labor, and capital inputs were I part-time rural households (I PTRH), followed by full-time rural households (FTRH). In contrast, II part-time rural households (II PTRH) and non-agricultural rural households (NARH) had higher levels of non-agricultural employment; however, their input levels gradually declined. (2) The CLUE of the sample rural households was generally low and had considerable potential for improvement. Regarding the types of rural households, as the degree of part-time employment increased, the CLUE showed an inverted U-shaped trend of first increased and then decreased, namely, I PTRH > FTRH > II PTRH > NARH. This finding indicates that appropriate part-time employment could help to promote investment in agricultural production and improve the CLUE. (3) The CLIB of rural households had significant effects on CLUE; the literacy of the agricultural labor force, yield-increasing input per unit area, per capita household income, share of agricultural income, operation scale of cultivated land, effective irrigation rate of cultivated land, and soil and water conservation rate of cultivated land had positive effects on improving CLUE. Even so, there was still significant heterogeneity in the degree of influence of different rural household types. The study concluded with some policy recommendations from the perspective of different rural household types to provide references for optimizing farming inputs and improving CLUE.

N2  - There is a need to address resource security and distributional justice in developing countries. People need water, energy, and food to sustain their livelihoods and to achieve sustainable development. The interactions between these resource sectors form the crux of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus assessments. In this study, we have utilised the WEF Nexus Index to analyse 54 African nations for whom sufficient data was available in 2019. The results for several countries were analysed to illustrate the opportunities and constraints for future development. The analysis demonstrates that, for many African countries, policies that undergird investments in energy supply projects are needed to unlock available freshwater resources to meet their food requirements. Such projects can be utilised to enhance the ability of farmers to manage water through drought-proofing rainfed agriculture, an increase in irrigation development, or both. WEF nexus-based studies, policies, and projects must be focussed on the direct and indirect achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 6, 7, and 13, both in terms of access and availability, to ensure distributional justice, especially in the African context. Such actions, combined with broad public participation, can have a ripple effect on other SDGs such as SDGs 5, 10, and 17, thereby reducing inequalities and building partnerships to attain these aspirational goals. The assessment of Africa’s relatively low scores in terms of the WEF Nexus Index does not represent a negative narrative. Instead, it provides an entry point to understanding the underlying challenges, through which more detailed analyses can lead to identified solutions and policies. Many African countries are trapped in an environment that could be termed a ‘poverty-unemployment-inequality nexus’ (due to the interlinkages that exist between these ‘wicked’ problems). The WEF Nexus Index provides high-level insights into these opportunities.

N2  - We study the effects of extreme temperature shocks on political participation using data from Indian elections between 2009 and 2017. Taking advantage of localized, high-frequency data on land surface temperatures, we find that areas with greater cumulative exposure to extreme temperatures experience an increase in voter turnout and a change in the composition of the pool of candidates who stand for election. As a consequence, electoral outcomes are affected. We provide evidence that our results are driven by the negative effect of climate change on agricultural productivity. First, we show that the results are strongest in areas with a larger rural population. Second, we show that there is a non-monotonic relationship between temperatures and turnout which closely mirrors the relationship between temperatures and agricultural productivity. We also find that, following temperature shocks, winning candidates are more likely to have an agricultural background. Finally, we show that politicians with an agricultural background invest more in irrigation, which mitigates the effects of high temperatures, on both agricultural production and on turnout. Our paper provides new evidence about the ways in which political agents in developing countries (including both voters and candidates) may respond to climate change via political channels.

N2  - The resilience of urban agriculture systems to climate change impacts has been little explored. It is known that urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) faces multiple challenges and constraints in the urban space ranging from soil and water contamination, exposure to climate-related risks and competition over space and resources often putting marginalized and poor population groups at a disadvantage. This part of the urban food futures programme (UFFP) aims to research UPA and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) as a potential adaption option for urban agriculture, protecting crops, livestock, and fish from extreme weather events or pest and disease outbreak. In this context we explored the role of UPA and CEA in building local food system resilience during a six-month scoping phase. We explored the soil health and soil quality in urban gardens in informal settlements in Cape Town (South Africa); conducted a feasibility study and cost benefit analysis on a selection of CEA systems in Kenya; conducted key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD) in Nairobi (Kenya) and in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to better understand the role UPA can play in local food system resilience. Still an issue even today is land ownership, affordable water access and quality, sociocultural dynamics and unclear regulations of resource use, lack of regionwide knowledge and skill development, impact on dietary diversity, and market-oriented approaches. There are suitable CEA technologies available In Kenia and Burkina Faso from simple crop protection in the field to medium end facilities (hydroponics, plastic-/greenhouses). We find that UPA and CEA can create income opportunities, complement income, but it can also cause financial indebtedness. There are cost-efficient CEA systems available but need technical expertise, a continuous water and energy supply and enabling financial institutional support for farmers investments. Using CEA requires the provision of training and skill development by private and public institutions, rights to land usage or land ownership to enable long-term planning and investments, an enabling legal framework, access to agricultural equipment and inputs and a healthy biosphere in terms of a healthy soil and clean irrigation and wash water. Some schools in Nairobi practice UPA on their properties and use to some extend CEA. The school gardens help to produce at a noticeable quantity nutritious and more diverse school meals while also having a pedagogical impact. Overall, preliminary data suggests that UPA can complement local diets and diversify the food basket. At what quantity, needs to be explored further. UPA in Nairobi and Ouagadougou bears great potential to be multifunctional and could serve as a nature-based solution e.g., in the Greenbelt of Ouagadougou. To better deal with climate related issues such as flooding, water scarcity and energy lacks, some farmers practice agroecological techniques known from the rural areas now in Ouagadougou but also use micro gardens to save production during flooding and use solar energy to pump water up from boreholes. We conclude that UPA and CEA can play a minor but important role in building local resilient food systems if adapted to the local needs and conditions while strengthening a local inclusive and enabling framework.

N2  - Pressurized irrigation systems are efficient tools for improving agricultural water productivity. Although increasing irrigation efficiency leads to saving water and increasing water efficiency, the implementation and usage of pressurized irrigation systems require energy supply and related tools and equipment, followed by greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, one of the factors in the degradation of the environment is the phenomenon of global warming due to carbon dioxide emissions. In the present study, drip irrigation systems implemented in Qazvin province during 2010-2020 were randomly selected and evaluated for energy flow and greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, 17 drip irrigation systems, including pistachio, apple, peach, and nectarine crops, were randomly selected and studied in terms of energy flow and emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the energy equivalent coefficients and carbon dioxide emissions coefficient, the total input energy and carbon dioxide emissions for the drip irrigation systems were calculated. The country's agricultural authorities have considered and invested in the development and implementation of pressurized irrigation systems as one of the methods for proper use of water. Due to the phenomenon of global warming, the primary source of which is greenhouse gas emissions, any activity in the production of equipment, energy, and mechanization of irrigation systems leads to the production of greenhouse gases, which in turn increases the air temperature and crop water requirements and climate change. Given the phenomenon of global warming, the main source of which is the production of greenhouse gases, any activity in the direction of the production of equipment, energy, and mechanization of irrigation systems leads to the production of greenhouse gases, which in turn increase the temperature and change the need for water and climate change.

N2  - The irrigation water effective utilization coefficient (IWEUC) is a critical indication of agricultural water use efficiency. To improve water-saving potential, the inter-annual variation of IWEUC from 2014 to 2021 in Jiangsu Province was analyzed. Taking consideration of natural factors, planting structure, management levels, and water-saving engineering, the primary influencing factors of IWEUC were investigated through principal component analysis. The results revealed that IWEUC in Jiangsu Province was higher than the annual national level and showed an insignificant increasing trend. IWEUC and its trend were negatively correlated with irrigation district size. Water-saving irrigation areas had an extremely significant impact on IWEUC (P &lt; 0.01). The positive load of water-saving engineering investment was rated first. Furthermore, economic and water-saving benefits for different irrigation district scales based on the TOPSIS model were evaluated. Despite restricted government support, the economic gains for large irrigation districts were superior to those for small irrigation districts. In the past decade, agricultural water declined while agricultural water conservation rose. The completion of integrated agricultural water pricing reform, as well as the improvement of water-saving engineering and optimization of management level, had a significant beneficial influence on IWEUC. Jiangsu's IWEUC has been efficiently implemented, and provides guidelines in other regions.

N2  - Food security in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the major issues confronting the continent. Innovative use of fresh water, the world’s scarcest food production resource, is vital for family-run small-holder agricultural systems, which supply up to 80% of the world’s food. Agriculture employs 70% of Tanzania’s rural population and supplies 95% of the country’s food. The goal was to measure the impact of smart drip irrigation kits on smallholder farmers’ resilience and rural poverty in Tanzania. A household survey was conducted using an exploratory sequential design in four districts (Babati, Hai, Kasulu, and Kilosa) in Tanzania. A total of 383 respondents (Micro-investing (MI) farmers, n = 195; control, n = 187) were randomly selected from a pool of 3444 farmers. Partial budgeting and enterprise economic analysis were used for the calculation of gross margins, and multivariate analysis was used for poverty analysis. Gross margin analysis showed that communities using drip-irrigated vegetable farming are more profitable. Partial budgeting analysis showed that micro-irrigation increased the revenue generation for most vegetable varieties. However, multivariate analysis was unable to confirm that household poverty was markedly reduced through the adoption of this technology. Half of the MI farmers could afford an education for their children due to the extra income generated from MI. This investment strategy has the potential to improve smallholder livelihoods and resilience to climate change.

In Indonesia, PBME has only been implemented by NGOs that provide project loans and grants. This study carried out PBME on the Serang Regency government irrigation development project in 2015-2020. The aim is to measure the impact or benefits of development on the economy in the form of agricultural products, which are calculated using indicators of economic feasibility, namely Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Net Present Value (NPV), as well as conducting improvement studies and providing recommendations to stakeholders. By using the method of collecting data by conducting interviews and questionnaires to the farmers, and the Department of Public Works and Spatial Planning Kab.

Then it is calculated using an investment feasibility analysis, namely BCR and NPV with the assumption of an interest rate of 3.5% and 8%. In the sensitivity analysis, in the scenario of the effect of irrigation improvements on increasing farm income, the BCR value of 0.71 was obtained at an interest rate of 3.5% and a BCR of 0.66 at an interest rate of 8%. Meanwhile, the net present value benefit was -5,916,326,647.41 at an interest rate of 3.5% and -6,264,733,105.51 at an interest rate of 8%. Judging from the results of the economic feasibility analysis, it is seen that the BCR and NPV values ??are still below the predetermined standard. It is necessary to make improvements and provide recommendations to stakeholders so that the benefits received can be in accordance with the investment feasibility criteria.

N2  - Apple (Malus domestica) is cultivated in Southern Ethiopia. However, the crop is being grown in without affirming the suitability of the land for its cultivation. Therefore, this research was conducted to assess the suitability of the land of Sentele Watershed for apple production in Southern Ethiopia. Integrating GIS and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which is widely used in multi-criteria decision-making for tackling multi-attribute decision-making problems in real situations, was used in this study. In the application techniques, most attributes that determine apple growth, climate, edaphic, topography, and current land use/land cover were combined. In determining the weights of the attributes, the opinions of experts and experienced apple orchard workers were considered, and an agricultural land suitability map was produced as highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and least suitable. The methodology was based on the land evaluation developed by FAO (1976) that suggests biophysical diagnostic factors, which most strongly influenced the cultivation of apples. Criteria were defined, background information was gathered, and a raster surface was created. The layers are reclassified, weighed, and then the output layers are overlaid with the background information such as a map of topography to see the best potential sites and to prepare the final suitability map. The final apple suitability map showed that only 2.2% of the total land is highly suitable, 32% is moderately suitable, and 52.1% is marginally suitable, and it requires detailed investigation and careful decision over other land uses to invest in it. 13.7% is the least suitable for apple cultivation. It is concluded that about 34% of the total land of the study area is suitable for apple production, and about 66% is unsuitable. The results imply that it is necessary to take improvement measures such as irrigation, species selection, removing leaves (defoliation), and appropriate land-use planning in most of the land of the watershed before investing in apple cultivation and production, and it is necessary to expand apple production in the future only in areas that are highly and moderately suitable for producing the crop in the study area.

N2  - Increasing evidence shows that farm households in developing countries maintain a portfolio of income-generating activities. Concerns have been raised that household income diversification to include nonfarm activities will stifle farm works, and thus reduce agricultural productivity. On the contrary, some evidence of complementarity between the farm and nonfarm activities in rural areas has been found. This paper uses data from the fourth and the fifth waves of Tanzania's National Panel Surveys to examine whether there exists complementarity or substitutability between farm and nonfarm activities in rural Tanzania. The findings show that participation in off-farm work and nonfarm business activities has no clear relationship to the adoption and use of improved agricultural practices, namely, irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. Participation in off-farm work and nonfarm business activities does not also seem to directly influence agricultural investments, production, and productivity nor overall household income. These results suggest that the complementary and substitution effects of nonfarm activities offset each other in Tanzania, implying that proper policies are required to unleash the potential impact of nonfarm activities on agriculture.

N2  - This chapter argues that the old institutions governing water in MENA are suffering from lack of legitimacy and trust to manage the 21st century problems of allocating water amidst drastic scarcity, induced by climate-change and population-growth. Institutions are unable to win voluntary compliance with restrictions on the quantity of water that can be used, or the tariff that needs to be paid to cover the costs of delivering water services. That is, water regulations and tariffs lack legitimacy. Lack of trust in and among utility staff and managers, that they can improve water service delivery performance, keeps utilities persistently inefficient and underfunded. Global capital is not flowing sufficiently to finance water infrastructure in MENA because investors are not assured of recouping steady returns. Returns to capital are risky because available evidence suggests that the infrastructure that would be financed is not well managed for cost efficiency and revenue raising potential. Attracting private investment, while representing citizens’ interests in the face of monopoly power, requires a legitimate or credible policy environment, trusted and creditworthy state agencies. But political conditions in the region are such that global markets worry about policy legitimacy, lack of transparency and creditworthiness. The chapter provides ideas for institutional reforms, using the crisis and emotive power of water in MENA as an opportunity.

N2  - Agricultural policies in Kenya tend to influence agricultural related aspects such as resource allocation to agriculture, input and out price stability, budget allocation and investments in agriculture. Rice has always been considered in the blanket agricultural policies and strategies such as the earliest National Development Plans that were developed immediately after gaining independence. However, it is of recent that stand-alone rice-related policies and strategies have emerged. To understand the impacts of agricultural policies in Kenya on rice value chain, a review based on the already published literature from the colonial period to date was conducted. During the colonial period, government policies were favourable towards export crops such as tea, coffee, cotton and pyrethrum. Rice indirectly benefited from the general rehabilitation of infrastructure. During the post-independence era, the main goal of policies within Kenya were equitable distribution of income, transfer of land, smallholder development. It was marked with establishment of main rice irrigation schemes. In 2008, a stand-alone rice specific National Rice Development Strategy phase one was developed to drive the development within the rice value chain. The second phase runs from 2019 to 2030. Most of the targets have been achieved, however, productivity has still stagnated thus the reliance on importation to meet the domestic demand. Inclusion of rice farming communities in the development of rice-related strategies and interventions can generate greater ownership of rice interventions. Learning from the previous intervention and fast tracking the implementation of the plans and policies can better guide the attainment of the objectives.

N2  - Water table management through controlled tile drainage and subsurface-irrigation (CDSI), retrofitting to conventional tile drainage, have been developed as beneficial water management practices (BWMPs) in eastern Canada. The implementation of the BWMPs aims to reduce adverse environmental impacts of irrigation and drainage and thus sustain agroecosystem services and crop productivity. Therefore, based on the underlying socio-economic benefits of retrofitting conventional tile drainage to BWMPs, farmers’ voluntary adoption of these agroecological beneficial technologies has been encouraged to improve agricultural water management and the agri-environment. Since an environmental profile of BWMPs is a prerequisite to understanding their socio- economic benefits, a life cycle assessment was conducted to assess the environmental impacts of CDSI on continuous corn production for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons at St-Emmanuel, south-western Quebec, compared to the free drainage (FD) baseline scenario. Following the standard life cycle assessment process, inventory flows of corn production with CDSI and FD were developed using biophysical data from field experiments and public databases. Then, seven environmental categories were analyzed to compare the environmental impacts of corn production with CDSI and FD: (1) land use, (2) climate change, (3) eutrophication potential, (4) acidification potential, (5) human toxicity, (6) terrestrial ecotoxicity, and (7) freshwater ecotoxicity. As a result, the corn production system with CDSI suggested better environmental performances in most assessed impact categories than FD, including land use, climate change, eutrophication potential, human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity. However, it is worth noting that the high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in 2014 may increase the risks of climate change and acidification impacts from the implementation of CDSI. In conclusion, there exist comprehensive environmental benefits of implementing CDSI, particularly in improving water quality. However, potential synergy and tradeoffs of climate change, eutrophication, and acidification impacts from the implementation of CDSI, especially under different climatic conditions, should be investigated to stable the performance of the technology. The third paper employed the conceptual framework of co-benefits in climate change mitigation to quantitatively evaluate the co-benefits of implementing BWMPs. The evaluation method consists of financial analysis and life cycle assessment to measure the economic return and environmental benefits of investing in CDSI compared with the Base technology of conventional free drainage system. Based on the field experiments conducted on a continuous corn production system for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in St-Emmanuel, Quebec, co-benefits were estimated as the sum of the differences in net present value and the reduction in environmental costs between BWMPs and Base technology. As a result, the assessed co-benefits of implementing BWMPs compared to Base technology were around $129.42 - $142.03 per hectare under median-level environmental prices; $158.29 - $231.74 per hectare under upper-level environmental prices. The positive co-benefits illustrate the additional benefits of implementing BWMPs in addition to GHG emission mitigation. Accordingly, BWMPs can be developed and adopted as farm-level adaptation practices to climate change. Next, based on a conceptual framework for environmental-economic decision-making with multi-criteria analysis (MCDA), GIS-based MCDA was used to analyze and estimate the decision-making of implementing beneficial water management practices (BWMPs) in Ontario, Canada. Decision-making from private and public perspectives was concerned with diverse economic and environmental priorities in this study. The results included a farm- scale case study and an extended regional-scale decision map of BWMPs implementation. Specifically, in the research farm case study, private farmers may not implement BWMPs due to their high priorities for economic criteria. In contrast, BWMPs should be selected by the public for their fairly environmental benefits to society. Likewise, the regional decision map regarding GIS-based MCDA displays that projected areas of implementing BWMPs with private and public concern differ for 22.10% and 44.38%, respectively, of Ontario 2016’s total land in crops. Conclusively, conflicted decisions from private and public perspectives regarding implementing BWMPs can inhibit the farmers’ voluntary adoption of BWMPs and the achievement of public environmental goals in agriculture. The dilemma between private and public concern suggests the rationale for evoking agri-environmental policy in grant- ing incentives to support the adoption of BWMPs, such as green payments, environmental stewardship programs and extension activities. Paper in chapter 5 employed agent-based modelling (ABM) to calibrate the policy-induced dynamic adoption/diffusion process of agri-environmental technology due to previous micro- level studies’ limitations of using the econometric models from the ex-post perspective and the absence of policy interventions. A framework of policy-induced agri-environmental technology was introduced with model components and implementation process based on related research regarding technology adoption and ABM. Further, results were simulated from an agent-based model given the presumed policy programs regarding the adoption of BWMPs in a case study of Essex county, Ontario, Canada. The results highlighted the dynamic adoption/diffusion process and policy evaluation to explain how ABM can support the agri- environmental policy design. Conclusively, the model provided a flexible quantitative tool to support ex-ante evaluation and design of policy regarding social-ecological systems, based on forecasting farmers’ adoption decision-making and outcomes in a future period. Lastly, potential improvements to extend the inherent farmers’ adoption behaviour algorithm, computing capability, and model validation were discussed for future research. The four papers in this thesis build together an interdisciplinary case of constructing a comprehensive analytic and decision-making system for the adoption of an innovative water management system in eastern Canada. Based on the socio-economic assessment, the environmental improvements of BWMPs implementation, mainly in reducing GHG emissions and eutrophication, primarily support the adoption prospects of this innovative water management system as a climate change mitigation and adaptation measure in eastern Canada. However, the conflicting decisions on BWMPs implementation from private and public perspectives prevent farmers’ voluntary adoption of BWMPs, implying the rationale for policy instruments. Accordingly, an agent-based model was developed for predicting the policy- induced adoption process of BWMPs as a ”test-bed” tool for policy design and evaluation. Finally, this thesis recognizes the scientific knowledge and policy implications regarding the adoption of BWMPs to support agricultural sustainability in eastern Canada, particularly aiming at climate change mitigation and adaptation.

N2  - With the aim to meet the heightening food demand of the ever-increasing population, several irrigation schemes were established particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. In Nigeria, huge investment has been made to develop irrigation infrastructures. However, many reported instances revealed that a larger proportion of these irrigation schemes perform far below expectations due to poor management and maintenance culture. Several performance evaluation criteria such as water allocation indicators (equity, adequacy, reliability, etc.), infrastructural, operational, institutional, and participatory are among the popularly known and widely used metrics for assessing irrigation scheme performance. However, an exploratory and robust approach that attracted little attention, especially in Nigeria is the value-based approach such as the value engineering method. To this end, a value engineering-based framework for assessing the performance of irrigation scheme components was developed and reported herein. The framework comprised the following phases; problem identification, system functionality analysis model, creation, evaluation and development of value alternative. Each phase is equipped with a separate framework in the form of a table and/or figure where information can be filled or analyzed. The framework is aiming to serve as a guide to future studies on the performance assessment of irrigation schemes as a whole or its components thereby, generating a set of new information on the state of functionality of the components under study. The information could inform relevant decision-makers, thereby attempting to deploy some corrective measures for sustainable irrigation scheme operation, profitable crop production as well as food security.

N2  - Because of the presence of shallow water tables and consequent secondary salinization in irrigated areas of Xinjiang China, there is an urgent need for installation of drainage systems to control the salinity levels in the crop rootzone. The goal of this study was to compare the midterm effects of the open ditch (depth of 2.2 m) and subsurface pipe (depth of 2.2 m) drainages on soil salinity, drainage, groundwater, cotton biomass, yield, and economic benefits while using drip irrigation under mulch (plastic film). We conducted a field experiment for eight consecutive years (2012–2019) in Shawan County of Xinjiang, China. Our experimental results indicated that open ditch and subsurface pipe drainages each reduced total soil salinity, improved saline–sodic soils, and controlled groundwater level, which caused a significant increase in the cotton biomass and yield. The open ditch drainage treatment (ODDA) represented a better desalination effect than the subsurface pipe drainage treatment (SPDA) at 73% and 81%, respectively. The electrical conductivity and pH of ODDA and SPDA water samples decreased as the soil salinities decreased over time. We used the farmland conditions from 2012 as the baseline for our experiment and evaluated how these baseline conditions changed over time in response to these treatments. Compared to this baseline, the cotton yield of ODDA and SPDA treated farmland increased by 18.30 times and 19.96 times in 2019, respectively. The investment payback periods for ODDA and SPDA treatments were 7.59 and 6.34 years, respectively, and their returns on investment were 12% and 30%, respectively. The midterm economic benefits of subsurface pipe drainage were more prominent than those of open ditch drainage. These results provide a reference for improving, developing, and utilizing soil saline–sodic land, and the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas.

N2  - Climate change will have an especially negative impact on the Mediterranean region in the twenty-first century. Rising temperatures and more severe droughts will have an impact on precipitation patterns and, as a result, on water resources. The temperatures in the Mediterranean region are expected to rise +3 to 5 °C by 2100. The water-poor countries are likely to be the most affected by 2100, and rainfall is likely to decrease by 20–30% in the countries to the south of Mediterranean. Against these challenges, countries invest in large irrigation projects to increase welfare and to alleviate economic disparities within regions. Lower Seyhan Irrigation Project (LSIP) in southern Turkey is such a project initiated for hydro-energy, irrigation, drainage and flood control. This paper evaluates the adaptation capacity of the Lower Seyhan Irrigation Project area to the future climate change as a case study. The case study reflects the outcomes of the Turkish Japanese bi-lateral project entitled “Impact of Climate Changes on the Agricultural Production System in Arid Areas - ICCAP”. The surface temperature may increase by 2.0 °C to 3.5 °C respectively by 2070. The total precipitation will decrease by 25% in the LSIP area.

N2  - Integrated farming system refers to agricultural systems that integrate livestock and crop production. So there is a mutual dependency between agricultural and livestock activities. It is a whole farm management system which aims to deliver more sustainable agriculture. According to a given site and situation, this process uses the best combination of modern tools and technologies with traditional practices. This study analyses the economic impact of integrated farming system over traditional farming practices in the lower Gangetic plains of West Bengal, India. Under integrated farming system, the overall gain in system productivity is 14.97%. The estimated change is attributable to the relative change in input use. Quantity of organic manure use (-7.42%) followed by bullock labour use (-5.03%) and hour of irrigation use (-2.52%) have played negatively significant role on crop productivity change. Whereas, the use of machine labour (4.69%) and human labour (4.23%) have shown positively significant effect on crop productivity change. The return per rupee of investment was found to be sufficiently higher for farm households following integrated farming system (1.60) compared to the traditional farm families (1.30)

N2  - This paper aims to assess the sustainability of coffee production in Brazil by a framework at the farm level. The framework developed comprises four dimensions of sustainability structured from the literature review. Primary data were collected from 20 coffee farms selected from the most producing communities in the Planalto de Vitória da Conquista locality, sited in Centro-Sul Baiano middle region at the Bahia state. The main environmental issues identified related to coffee farmers are inadequate management of water consumption, influenced by the lack of knowledge about irrigation techniques in some cases, and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The economic evaluation of the activity revealed a low index of producers belonging to a class organization. In social aspects the issues are low level of technical/technological instruction for coffee producers, temporary workers are often used, the old age of most producers, the lack of family succession for the activity, low incomes, the high number of temporary workers, and the absence of the worker gains. As for the technical dimension, only half of the farmers invest in innovation, which causes high obsolescence of their equipment and machinery and a low participation rate in training courses. In the environmental dimension, the farmers return the packages of pesticides to the stores where they bought them. In the technical dimension, most farmers perform soil analysis. Besides addressing the identified challenges, the initiatives can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, especially the 9th, 12th, and 13th.

The governance framework discusses the various actors involved in water in agriculture and the policy environment, which, in turn, affect the irrigation development performance. The country’s performance in agricultural water management is assessed in terms of area irrigated by public investments, cropping intensity, collection efficiency, and productivity impact. To improve performance and agricultural productivity, the major challenges facing national and communal irrigation systems are identified. These challenges require policy changes to address poor performance, unsustainability of systems, and weak management capacities.

The project targets to pilot different models of CSVs in different agro-ecological conditions and develop local level evidences for detailed implementation guideline for scaling out CSV models in Nepal. The designing and implementation of CSV starts with the baseline assessment of climate risks, existing crops and cropping patterns, current level of sensitivity to climatic hazards, level of adaptive capacity of villages and assessing potential for scaling out various climate smart technologies. In addition to collecting baseline information for designing and implementing CSVs, the baseline assessment is also required for measuring the success, outcomes and impact of CSV project at the end of the project. Thus, this study has been carried out in five districts namely Dang, Bardiya, Nawalparasi, Mahottari and Gorkha where interventions of CSV are being implemented. Data for this baseline study was collected from secondary sources, focus group discussion and household survey. Secondary sources were referred for district and village level population, land use, food security and resource endowment (land, water, forest and markets). Climatic risk, agriculture vulnerability, adaptive capacity, change in crop calendar and VDC level investment in climate related activities were collected from focus group discussion. Household related information of respondents such as household size, household assets, cropping system, irrigation status, household level food security, sources of income and climate agriculture technologies were captured through household level survey. Major climatic risk in project sites are drought, flood, water logged condition, plant insect pest, fog and landslide. To cope with these situation, the farmers have adopted different agricultural and non-agricultural technologies from their side though it is not enough to sustain their livelihood.

To increase performance of grain drill in dry soil conditions need to design the new opener for grain drills. This study has been carried out for the economic evaluation of the suitable tillage method for planting by grain drill equipped with a bent leg furrow opener and their effect on the yield of irrigated wheat. This study was a randomized complete block experimental design with four treatments and four replications. Treatments were seeding winter wheat by a grain drill with bent leg furrow opener in three tillage practices of no-tillage (T1), reduced tillage (T2), and conventional tillage (T3). Seeding wheat by conventional grain drill in the conventionally tilled plots was also used as control treatment (T4). In order to investigate the economic effects of tillage and planting methods by the bent leg grain drill on wheat yield, the income and cost of treatments were measured, and using the marginal net profit analysis method, the economic rate of return on investment of each method. The results of showed that the most suitable treatment from the economic point of view is the bent leg tillage treatment + planting with a grain drill equipped with a bent leg furrow opener. The findings showed that the bent leg tillage + the bent leg grain drill, as a new technology, has the potential to increase crop yield and can increase the farmer's net profit.

N2  - Agricultural ecosystems depend on free environmental flows such as water, wind, sunlight, soil and soil organic matter and non-free flows such as fertilizers, pesticides, electricity, fuel, mechanical equipment and other industrial products. In this context, it is useful to use biophysical methods based on thermodynamic laws such as energy analysis, exergy analysis, exergy evaluation and life cycle evaluation with regard to the contribution of environmental services and inputs in the production system based on equivalent unit.By applying the emergy approach to analyzing the sustainability of agricultural systems, we can ensure that adequate management is implemented in order to increase the sustainability of production in these systems.In this regard, by evaluating and comparing two flood and drip irrigation systems in pistachio production using the integration of emergy and economic indicators, it is possible to provide an accurate picture of the sustainability of the two pistachio irrigation systems in Qom city, so that based on the results, Solutions for the development of cultivation and stabilization of pistachio production and the optimal presence of this plant in the cultivation pattern of the region should be provided.In the current study, two irrigation systems for pistachio fields in Qom Province, Iran, were analyzed using emergy analysis. For this study, we measured free renewable and non-renewable environmental flows, as well as non-free flows, in 2019 for two pistachio production systems that were irrigated by flood and rain.Free renewable environmental flows including sunlight, rain, wind, evaporation and transpiration and river water; Non-renewable environmental free flows including erosion and losses of soil organic matter; Non-free flows include chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, machinery, fuel, organic fertilizers, labor and electricity that originate from outside the system.The output of the system was pistachio product. The largest free environmental input in both systems was the chemical energy of rain with 5.90E+14 sej ha-1 year-1.Renewable environmental flows for both systems in this study were 6.36E+14 sej ha-1 year-1.This category of input sources for flood and drip irrigation systems constituted 1.57% and 2.34% of the total inputs to each system, respectively.Consumption of underground water resources, evaporation and transpiration, loss of soil organic matter and soil erosion formed the main components of non-renewable environmental flows, whose share of the total input energy for flood and drip irrigation systems was 52.06% and 33.99%, respectively.Most of the flow of non-renewable environmental inputs in both systems was related to underground water. In general, the amount of underground water consumption, evaporation and transpiration and soil erosion was higher in flood irrigation system than drip irrigation system. The total emergy inputs for the flood and drip irrigation systems were calculated to be 4.05E+16 and 2.72E+16 sej ha-1 year-1, respectively, according to the findings. In contrast to the flood irrigation system, the drip irrigation system was more reliant on purchased supplies than on environmental inputs. Groundwater consumption accounted for 27.00% of total energy input in the flood irrigation system, while livestock manure accounted for 26.14% of total energy input in the drip irrigation system. Transformities in the flood and drip irrigation systems were 9.05E+05 and 5.46E+05 sej J-1, respectively; emergy renewabilities were 2.43% and 3.45%; emergy yield ratios were 2.157 and 1.571; emergy investment ratios were 0.86 and 1.75; standard environmental loading ratios were 62.76 and 41.74; and standard emergy sustainability indices were 0.034 and 0.038, respectively. Despite the flood irrigation system's larger contribution of environmental resources, the high use of groundwater as a non-renewable input resulted in an increase in environmental burden. The adoption of drip irrigation will lessen environmental burden on ecosystems while also improving water use. In the current study, the drip irrigation system outperformed the flood irrigation system in terms of yield, resource efficiency, renewability, and environmental sustainability.

Results From 2004 to 2021, molluscide was applied to a total area of 100 061.87 hm2 in Yunnan Province. 4 146 548 people and 1 823 871 cattle underwent extended chemotherapy, and 293 731 innocuous-sanitary toilets were built. 4 277 980 cattle were raised in pens, 13 371 cattle were eliminated and 96 181 cattle were replaced by machines. In total, 64 624.40 hm2 of water area was replaced with dry land, and 925.16 km of irrigated areas were transformed. 1.266 5 million people were access to safe drinking water. 14 464.14 hm2 forests were planted for snail suppression and disease prevention, and 56.99 hm2 of land was leveled. In 2004, the positive rate of human blood test was 21.10%, the corrected infection rate was 2.51%. The infection rate of cattle and Oncomelania hupensis was 3.76% and 0.70%, respectively. Infected snails were found in 771 sites, and the area with snails was 4 364.79 hm2. The occurrence rate of snail in individual frame and live snail density were 4.71% and 0.256 0 snails/0.1 m2, respectively. In 2021, the positive rate of human blood test was 2.21%, and the corrected infection rate and cattle infection rate were both zero. No infected snails were detected after 2013. In 2021, the area with snails was 1 058.59 hm2, and the rate of snails occurred in individual frame and live snail density were 1.21% and 0.034 3 snails /0.1 m2 respectively. 3.986 715 2 billion yuan was used for comprehensive control of schistosomiasis in Yunnan Province from 2004 to 2021. The average annual investment was 199.832 6 million yuan from 2004 to 2008; 253.001 6 million yuan from 2009 to 2015; and 202.756 8 million yuan from 2016 to 2021, respectively. Conclusion The comprehensive control measures primarily based on control of the transmission sources of schistosomiasis in Yunnan Province have achieved remarkable results, and lead to obviously decreased infection rate of schistosomiasis in population and cattle, as well as greatly reduced areas with snails. However, some difficulties still exist, including the bottleneck in further cutting down the snail area, and prevention and control of the infection sources in livestock. Following measures should include continuously ensuring the investment of funds to further improve the comprehensive control measures and consolidate the results of schistosomiasis control.

N2  - The success or failure of precision agriculture in India would be determined in large part by how institutions and the government implement the programmes. Before policymakers can grasp the lock screen application of precision agriculture in the Indian setting, much research on the subject is required. Precision agriculture can be looked at from three different angles: current, intermediate, and future. The present state will focus on soil management and raising precision agriculture awareness during the next five months using various mass media tactics. The intermediate state will generate zones at random and conduct research to better understand precision agriculture and its results across the country, with a focus on studying computer-based data from various zones. Coated State will focus on simulating farming circumstances utilising sensors and computer-based data, and then making decisions based on that information to provide a favourable farming outcome.

N2  - The ever-increasing population and a decrease in available freshwater resources have resulted in continued water scarcity globally. The situation is worse in certain areas than others, especially in countries and regions with limited water resources. Being a desert country that lacks many rivers and other natural water resources together with continuous increase in population, Algeria faces significant challenges in accessing fresh water. The gap in the demand and supply of water affects households and agriculture, which significantly depends on irrigation for successful operations. The impact of the water supply deficit is being felt across the country and in major cities, such as Algiers and Oran. Although Algeria has employed desalination technology to meet the water shortage challenge in the past, most of the water produced using the technology has only been able to meet the water needs in the oil and steel industries. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of some of these large-scale investments and assess them in light of their effectiveness in teams of their cost and their ability to meet the water supply shortages in Algeria.

N2  - We explore the economic merits of on-farm water storage with tailwater recovery systems to reduce aquifer depletion in a region with expanding irrigated acreage and substantial off-season precipitation. Gains are substantial on a broad scale and long planning horizon, including more than $4 billion in producer surplus, 5 million acre-feet of conserved groundwater, and land capitalization of $24 per acre. Sensitivity analyses provide insights with respect to the impact of discount rates, rainfed returns, return flows, and aquifer recharge rates. Results can inform stakeholders about the optimal allocation of funds directed at agricultural practice adoption and agricultural water investments.

N2  - The steering pivot element of agricultural development depends on the direction of its investment decision for overall economic growth, The study critically identifies and analyses the potential level of investment in Romanian agriculture for sustainable development. Using the descriptive statistics, the micro-economic indicators of investment and their sprouting impact on the economic growth of Romanian agriculture were examined. The total country sector investments have been estimated from 2010-2020, farming and farmer’s investment in agricultural activities is positive at a mean average growth of about 4.59% and quite lower compared to major investment in manufacturing Industries for machines, buildings, agri-food products, and other assets as evidenced by the Gross Capital Formation 24.5%, which is the half average of European Union - 28 for living standard. The total value addition of investment sectors of the country at different levels indicates 89.72% against Gross Domestic Products and the production accounts for agriculture by Share is 4.03% in 2021 slightly down compared to 4.4% in 2019. The finding of the micro-economic variable indicators shows that the value of imports exceeds the exports of goods and services by -5.73%, indicating the negative external balance and insignificant contribution of economic investment, especially in the agriculture production sector of Romania’s reserve 2021. Despite the critical challenges of urbanization due to migration and changes in consumption patterns, the variables have statistical significance by the value at different levels, Implying that Investment decisions in modern agricultural machines, irrigation facilities, Greenhouses, land improvement, access to working capital as a variable indicator can increase the sector contribution to improve production growth vis-a-vis demand requirements for food security, income generation, and poverty escape at the micro-level and will lead to a major improvement shift in the value of an agricultural investment context for sustainable macroeconomic development.

N2  - Water planners must provide end-users with reliable and high-quality access to fresh water while complying with financial, institutional, and water availability constraints. In the pursuit of these goals, an over-investment in design can result in stranded assets of significant value and often unwanted environmental implications. Under-investment can lead to supply restrictions affecting human health, the economy, and the environment. The present study uses the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) to develop a balancing strateg

N2  - Access to reliable and clean energy is one of the key challenges that inhibit development of the agricultural sector in poor and developing countries. The modernization of manual and fossil-based agricultural practices through clean energy access are core elements for poverty reduction. However, commercial investment is still far away from being available for the majority of the sector and investors struggle to make a profitable case when approaching such high risk opportunities. Investment decision making relies more and more on accurate and data-driven indicators, and satellite imagery coupled with analytical tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are unlocking previously inaccessible ways of extracting high- impact information. A geospatial model that considers the Agri-Energy-Water nexus from a value chain perspective, standardises processing methods and offers market-driven outputs can serve as the first step for identifying and de-risking investment opportunities. The main objective of this piece of work is the creation of a suitable methodology and further geospatial, data-, and commercially-driven energy investment decision tool to evaluate the potential of electrifying agricultural value chains. The tool created in this study is based on Python language and QGIS software, and is meant to be replicable across countries and agricultural value chains. It allows the processing of raw geospatial datasets to obtain the spatial distribution of electricity requirements from prospective irrigation and crop processing activities electrification. Furthermore, it offers the extraction of economic indicators through a techno-economic feasibility assessment to finally map high-potential areas for electrification. The Nigerian rice value chain has been used to validate the model. Results indicate that annual electricity requirements for potential irrigation, threshing, milling, and destoning of rice are 328.1 GWh, 40.5 GWh, 92.2 GWh, and 10.1 GWh, respectively. The number of electric agricultural equipment that would be needed to cover the national electricity requirements are estimated at approximately 730,000 solar water pumps, 51,000 threshers, 9,700 mills and 10,400 destoners, which represents a total renewable power capacity of 2.5 GW and an investment of 5.6 billion USD for the agricultural sector. Smallholder rice farmers and processors accessing solar PV irrigation and electric threshing, milling, and destoning activities would perceive payback periods lower than 14 (fourteen), 5 (five), 1 (one), and 3 (three) years respectively in many areas of the country. These areas showing lower payback periods and thus highest potential are located in the states of Taraba, Benue, Ebonyi, Ondo, Kwara, Kaduna, and Kano.

N2  - Aiming at the phenomenon of outflow of agricultural land by old farmers, the data cited from the China Rural Development Survey were used in the present study.Based on theoretical derivation, panel fixed effects regression and propensity score matching methods were employed to analyze the impact of the aging of agricultural labor force on the circulation of agricultural land. It was shown that the estimated coefficients increased after the sample missing problem was alleviated. For farming households with full pensions and a smaller household agricultural income per labor (below the average level in village) or lower percentage of household agricultural income (<0.25), the outflow of agricultural land under the influence of aging was greater. When villagers were covered by the new rural cooperative medical insurance or a nursing home in the village, the outflow of agricultural land from old farmers tended to increase. When the villages provided public goods that could improve agricultural efficiency, such as irrigation facilities or mechanized farmland services, there would be a further outflow of agricultural land from farming households with a smaller household agricultural income per labor or lower percentage of household agricultural income. Accordingly, countermeasures were proposed to increase social security for old farmers in rural areas and to actively invest in public goods that could improve agricultural productivity.
