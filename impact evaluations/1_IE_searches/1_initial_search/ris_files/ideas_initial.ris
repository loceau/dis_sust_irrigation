N2  - We set up a model of land-use and irrigation water choices to assess the impact of dry weather conditions and possible restriction policies on farmers' payoffs in the Beauce area in France. Given the informational context, we construct a dynamic two-period model in which farmers make conjectures on the water abstraction by other users and take into account variations in the height of the water table. We solve the problem using dynamic programming. We simulate different restriction policies, proposed in the literature and tested in the field. We show that these restrictions, although efficient with respect to hydrological criteria, result in serious economic losses for the farmers.

N2  - Global climate change is already impacting water resources and, in many areas, reducing the amount of water available for drinking, sanitation, and agriculture. Water conservation can be a means to mitigate the economic damages associated with water scarcity, including scarcity arising from climate change. In the agricultural sector, most water conservation efforts have focused on farm-level irrigation efficiency. However, since over one-third of water applied for agricultural irrigation in the U.S. comes from off-farm supplies, improvements in delivery and conveyance efficiency also have the potential to significantly reduce water losses. This study utilizes survey data from irrigation water delivery organizations in the Western U.S. to estimate the impact of lining and piping conveyance infrastructure on conveyance losses. The average irrigation delivery organization reports a conveyance loss of 15 percent of the total water brought into their system in 2019. Using a control function estimation, this study finds that at the margin an increase of one percentage point in the share of conveyance infrastructure piped leads to an expected 0.16 percentage point reduction in conveyance losses. A simulated water-conservation supply curve based on these estimates shows that about 2.3 percent of total water brought into these systems could be recaptured at a private capital cost below $10,000 per acre foot.

Using a detailed dataset of 16,000 farms across Italy, the study examines likely warming impacts in different regions and for different sectors of Italian agriculture. The study finds that farm net revenues are very sensitive to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation. Livestock and crop farms have different responses to climate as do rainfed farms and irrigated crop farms. The overall results suggest mild consequences from marginal changes in climate but increasingly harmful effects from more severe climate scenarios.

N2  - Although there is now an extensive literature on the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture, no study has yet addressed the endogeneity of irrigation. This paper examines how climate affects the choice to irrigate and the conditional income earned by each farmer. The paper develops a selection model of irrigation choice and conditional income. Using data from farmers across eleven African countries, the paper demonstrates that the choice of irrigation is sensitive to both temperature and precipitation. Rainfed and irrigated farm income also both respond to climate but have different climate sensitivity. Impact models that fail to account for endogenous irrigation are biased.

N2  - We estimate how farmers adapted to a water restriction imposed through local governance. The restriction imposed a uniform quota on water use with a 5-year allocation and allowed trading of the quota within the restricted area. Our analysis exploits unique micro-level data on irrigated water use, irrigated acreage, and crops. We use a difference-in-differences econometric strategy that also includes farmer-time fixed effects to estimate the response to the restriction, where we exploit water rights between 2 and 5 miles of the policy boundary as a control group. Results indicate that farmers reduced water use by 26% due to the policy with most of the response due to reductions in water use intensity on the same crops rather than through reductions in irrigated acreage or changes in crops. The results imply that the short-run welfare impact of the policy was smaller than a policy that reduces irrigated acreage.

N2  - In recognition of the importance of drip irrigation, the paper addresses two important issues: factors limiting or enhancing the adoption of drip irrigation systems, and policy actions needed at different levels to speed up the adoption of drip irrigation and groundwater development. The drip method of irrigation is found to have a significant impact on resources saving, cost of cultivation, yield of crops and farm profitability. The adoption of drip irrigation is significantly influenced by experience, farm size, proportion of wider spaced crops and participation in non-farm income activities. The policies should focus on promotion of drip irrigation in those regions where scarcity of water and labour is severe and where shift towards wider-spaced crops is taking place.

N2  - The main economic activity of the people of Eritrea is agriculture: crop production and livestock herding. Agriculture mainly comprises mixed farming and some commercial concessions. Most agriculture is rain-fed. The main rain-fed crops are sorghum, millet and sesame, and the main irrigated crops are all horticultural crops like bananas, onions and tomatoes and cotton. The major livestock production constraints are disease, water and feed shortages and agricultural expansion especially in the river frontages. The agricultural sector employs eighty percent of the working population, but its production has not managed to cover internal food demand and is forced to cover nearly 50 per cent of its annual cereal requirements through imports-commercial and food assistance. Like most African countries, Eritrea is also a victim of the problem of food insecurity. In good years the country produces only about 60 per cent of its total food needs and in poor years, it produces no more than 25 per cent. On average, once in 10 years, the country is threatened with famines. Annual crop production depends on rainfall that is variable and unevenly distributed from year to year. Therefore, the primary goal of Eritrea is to guarantee food security by introducing modern technology, irrigation, terracing, soil and water conservation, with less dependence on rainwater. Thus the Government has articulated its food policy, which stresses national ownership of grant food assistance and to achieve food security in the coming five years. The policy indeed encompasses all sectoral policies and represents the Government’s engagements with regard to food security. Despite the general trends of improvement in the economy of Eritrea, it has not yet fully recovered, and thus will still continue to require variable degrees of food assistance for the coming few more years. Based on this historical and recurrent food insecurity in Eritrea, an attempt is made in this paper to assess the agriculture dev

N2  - The nature and extent of crop diversification in the state of Bihar has been analyzed using secondary data obtained from different publish sources of Govt. of Bihar from 2000-01 to 2014-15 i.e. a period of 15 years. Composite Entropy Index (CEI) and double log step-wise linear regression model was applied to assess the determinants of crop diversification in the state. The results have revealed that in almost all crops group very low diversification indices were observed. The study has suggested that despite plenty of natural resources available in the state, the economic improvement of farmers is in infancy. Pre-requisite infrastructural facilities like cheap sources of irrigation water (assured irrigation as the monsoon in the present decade had been erratic and scanty rainfall) and extension of technological know-how (quality seeds and fertilizers), may acts as catalyst in diversification of agriculture towards high-valued crops. These developmental efforts may be helpful in fetching good incomes by the cultivators.

N2  - Climate change is likely to have a profound effect on many agricultural variables, although the extent of its influence will vary over the course of the annual farm management cycle. Consequently, the effect of different and interconnected physical, technical and economic factors must be modeled in order to estimate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. Such modeling commonly makes use of indicators that summarize the among environmental factors that are considered when farmers plan their activities. This study uses net evapotranspiration (ET N ), estimated using EPIC, as a proxy index for the physical factors considered by farmers when managing irrigation. Recent trends suggest that the probability distribution function of ET N may continue to change in the near future due to changes in the irrigation needs of crops. Also, water availability may continue to vary due to changes in the rainfall regime. The impacts of the uncertainties related to these changes on costs are evaluated using a Discrete Stochastic Programming model representing an irrigable Mediterranean area where limited water is supplied from a reservoir. In this context, adaptation to climate change can be best supported by improvements to the collective irrigation systems, rather than by measures aimed at individual farms such as those contained within the rural development policy.

The probability distribution function (PDF) of climate variables shows that the near future will see an increasing probability of high temperatures and major irrigation requirements, with limited water resources. An economic model simulates the choices of farmers given the uncertainty represented by the PDF variability.. Crops suffer mainly due to more limited water resources, which can be counteracted by improving collective infrastructures for irrigation. Cow’s milk production suffers from the rising temperatures, which can be mitigated with cooling systems.

The categories of land such as barren land, culturable waste land and permanent pastures and grazing land have shown declining trend. Further, declining trend in net sown area and other fallow lands has been noticed. Current fallows reduced over the period till 2000s but it began to rise since 2000s afterwards. The rainfall and road length did have significant impact on the level of current fallows. Erratic monsoon and scarcity of labour during the study period of present century resulted/led to accumulation of current fallow lands. It was further observed that the non-agricultural use of land was identified as the dominant factor for changes in common lands as it affected the current fallows negatively. It is a challenging task for policy makers to maximize the income of farming community from continuous decline in net sown area, deteriorating climatic condition (erratic monsoon) as well as labour scarce conditions thus finally resulting in aggregation of current fallows. In order to discourage/ arrest the rising tendency in current fallows or put the current fallows under profitable cultivation, cheap source of irrigation is needed to be made available to cultivators.

N2  - Endowment of fertile Gangetic alluvial soil and abundant water resources, particularly groundwater resources altogether constitute core components for development of agriculture in Bihar. An effort has been made in this paper to analyze factors responsible for changes in land use pattern especially increase in current fallows, shrinking net sown area and shifting of land for non-agricultural purposes in the state. The categories of land such as barren, culturable waste and permanent pastures and grazing lands have shown declining trend and these land may probably have shifted towards other categories of area under non-agricultural uses, land under tree crops and groves as well as fallow lands. A larger concentration of current fallow lands was accounted for in Gaya, Patna, Purnea, Munger, Jehanabad & Kishanganj districts. The rainfall and road length did have significant impact on the level of current fallows. Erratic monsoon and labour scarcity during the study period of present century resulted in accumulation of current fallow lands. It was further observed that the non-agricultural use of land was identified as the dominant factor for changes in common lands as it affected the current fallows negatively. It is a challenging task for policy makers to maximize the income of farmers from a continuously declining in net sown area, deteriorating climatic conditions as well as labour scarce conditions, therby resulting in aggregation of current fallows. In order to discourage the rising tendency in current fallows or to bring current fallows under cultivation, cheap sources of irrigation are needed. Revival of canal irrigation, large scale expansion of electric/solar operated irrigation devices may be the suitable way, who in turn lower the production cost and enhance the margin of profit to the farmers.

N2  - Assessment of the expected impacts from climate change is an essential input for agencies engaged in fostering adaptation of local social-ecological systems. However, data is seldom available at the required scale. This study overcomes this hurdle by gathering data via an expert elicitation protocol. We report experts' judgements about two topics: i) the impacts from climate change on crop yields in three communities located in the Bolivian Altiplano; and ii) the effectiveness of specific irrigation techniques in mitigating the impacts from climate change in the communities under study. Our gathered data allow us to document heterogeneity of expected impacts across communities –with one community expected to experience an increase in yields under wet climate change scenarios. Experts judge irrigation as an effective mitigation tool under most of the dry climate change scenarios presented to them. We believe that our data collection strategy represents a promising decision support tool for a wide range of public policy issues. Particularly, when monetary and time constraints converge with the lack of scientific information. In addition, the information gathered with this methodology can be incorporated into participatory methodologies gathering information from local social-ecological systems.

Using district-level panels for 42 years from India and nonstationary and dynamic panel estimation procedures, we estimate the impact of weather risk on land use intensity. Our results suggest the impact of weather risk on land use intensity is negative in the short run. Additionally, we find a positive effect of share of high yielding varieties production and share of irrigated acreage on land use intensity. Our study also indicates that the impact of weather risk on land use intensity has diminished in the postâ€“market reform period (after 1990).

Drought, in particular, has had significant impacts on the country’s agricultural sector, and the frequency of droughts is expected to increase due to climate change. Existing governance and policy frameworks seek to ensure that the agricultural sector is prepared for, and able to respond to, adverse events as they occur. While these mechanisms contribute to improved resilience, further opportunities exist to strengthen policy processes, in particular by increasing farmer and private sector participation.

N2  - Particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is predominantly rain-fed and, therefore, prone to unstable weather conditions and less productive than in other regions of the world. Increasing the efficiency and sustainability of farmer groups and cooperatives is of primary importance to many policy makers in developing countries. Experimental studies have suggested that the privileged person in a group would voluntarily provide the public good in social dilemma situations, while those with lower benefits would free-ride. Using a framed lab-in-the-field experiment complemented by a detailed household survey in rural Ghana, we examine how asymmetries in benefits and real wealth levels impact farmers’ behavior and group outcomes. We find that efficiency concerns (i.e. higher group returns) outweigh inequality concerns. Thus, the implication is that higher group benefits and heterogeneous within-group benefits reduce strategic uncertainty and enhance cooperation in agricultural settings of subsistence farmers. Finally, aside from the group-level effects, we show that farmers with smaller potential benefits and those who live in poor households contribute even more than the resource rich. The results indicate that, as much as interventions are aimed at saving the poor, the poor contribute much to save themselves. These results remain robust, controlling for a long list of covariates including socioeconomic characteristics, loss aversion and inequality aversion. The results overall have implications for structuring farmer groups and the provision and maintenance of both public goods and common-pool resources in poor countries.

N2  - Irrigation in the Eastern US receives little attention compared to the West, but farmers in humid states of the US, traditionally reliant on rainfall, have more than tripled irrigation since 1978. We examine this trend in Illinois where there has been a nearly threefold increase in center pivot irrigation systems (CPIS) installations since 1988. Specifically, we analyze where and when CPIS installations occur and their benefits in terms of annual crop yield, irrigated acreage, crop selection, and reduction in drought-related insurance payouts. To do so, we create a novel data set derived from a deep learning model capable of automatically identifying the location of CPIS during drought years along with annual county level crop, weather, and insurance data. The results indicate CPIS installations in Illinois are significantly more common over alluvial aquifers after droughts. Additionally, counties with a higher presence of CPIS do not have higher average crop yields, a shift to more water intensive crops, or an expansion of cropland. However, in drought years CPIS presence does have a significant positive effect on corn yield and a significant negative effect on indemnity payments for both soybeans and corn. The results provide insights into an emerging trend of irrigation in humid regions, raising potential policy considerations for crop insurance and signaling a potential need to address water rights as demand increases.

N2  - This paper studies the impact of lobbying on policies in a centrally managed water economy. First, we develop an optimal control model in which long-run water-management policies are an outcome of negotiation between policymakers and a politically organized farming sector. We show that under equilibrium conditions in the political game, larger political power of the farmers' lobby leads to faster exhaustion of naturally replenished water resources, and expedites the investment in water-supply backstop technologies such as desalination. Then, we employ a detailed hydro-economic model of Israel's water economy to assess the validity of claims by scientists and bureaucrats that lobbying by the local agricultural sector has contributed to the depletion of the country's natural freshwater resources and thus accelerated the development of seawater desalination. Specifically, we compare observed trajectories of water-management policies in the years 2000–2020 to their simulated counterparts, and find a better fit for simulated scenarios that involve lobbying than for a socially optimal one; this result prevails under simulated conditions of extreme water shortage due to faster population growth or lower recharge of natural water sources. The best-fitted political-equilibrium scenarios indicate considerable deadweight loss. We discuss potential causes of over- and undervaluation of the lobbying effect.

I exploit temporal variation in decades-long averages of weather and estimate crop acreage elasticities with respect to climate change in the United States. I find substantial climate change adaptation through acreage adjustments in US agriculture. Climate change explains about 10–35% of the observed US corn and soybean expansion over the past 30 years, and climate-driven crop substitution has played an important role. The acreage response is heterogeneous across major and minor producing areas and across dryland and irrigated counties.

In this case all climate change damages can be offset with a benefit cost ration larger than one in all the climate regimes. Expensive irrigation expansion should however be applied on a much more limited acreage compared with soft measures. If adaptation costs are those of the high end estimates, full adaptation ceases to be cost/effective.This points out the need of a careful planning and implementation of adaptation, irrespectively on the type, looking for measures apt to control its unit cost.

N2  -  The present research offers an economic assessment of climate change impacts on the four major crop families characterizing Nigerian agriculture. The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper “soft measures” and more costly “hard” irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.

N2  - Agricultural production is heavily dependent on water availability for increasing productivity and decreasing volatility in production. However climate change is expected to increase the sectoral competition for water resources and raise the need for major changes in water policies. This study is the first to analyze the likely effects of climate change and changes in the Turkish economy via an economy-wide Walrasian Computable General Equilibrium model with a detailed account of the agricultural sector: 20 agricultural activities in each of the 5 regions are differentiated as irrigated and rainfed. Major macroeconomic indicators change significantly. The decline in GDP is significant. Wage rate falls, while other factors’ prices increase. Production of irrigated crops decline significantly. Balance of trade in agricultural products becomes negative. Rural households benefits from the increase in the agricultural prices, while urban households are hit hard.

We develop a new modeling approach as an alternative to include water as a production factor within a global CGE model. We tailor the structure of the ICES model to characterize the key features of the world economy with a detailed representation of the agricultural sector. In order to reach this objective, a new database has been built to explicitly consider water endowments, precipitation changes, and unitary irrigation costs. Results suggest different economic consequences of climate change depending on the specific region. Impacts are related to change in crop production, endowment demands, and international trade.

N2  - We analyze the economic determinants and effects of prior appropriation water rights that were voluntarily implemented across an immense area of the US West, abruptly replacing common-law riparian water rights. At the same time and place, vast private irrigation infrastructure added to the US capital stock. We build upon Ostrom and Gardner (1993) and model irrigation as a coordination problem to show how prior appropriation facilitated greater private infrastructure development than was possible under the baseline riparian system by i) securing access to water against future entry and ii) defining a property right that formed the basis for contracting around collective action problems among numerous, heterogeneous agents. We construct a dataset of 7,800 rights in Colorado, established between 1852 and 2013 including location, date, size, infrastructure investment, irrigated acreage, crops, topography, stream flow, soil quality, and precipitation to test the predictions of the model. We find that prior appropriation facilitated cooperation, doubling infrastructure investment and ultimately contributing between 3% and 21% of western state income in 1930. These outcomes are relative to the baseline alternative of a riparian system. The analysis reveals institutional innovation that informs our understanding of the development of property rights, prior appropriation, and contemporary water policy.

N2  - Rajasthan, the largest state in India, occupies 10.5 per cent of the total geographical area of the country, although about two-thirds of its area is arid. The state has a predominantly agrarian economy, and agriculture is the mainstay of about two-thirds of the workforce. Interestingly, only 28 per cent of the net cultivable area in the state is irrigated, compared to the national average of 49.8 per cent. With the aim to improve irrigation facilities and increase agricultural productivity, the state government implemented the solar photovoltaic water pumping system (SPVWPS) in 2008-09 as an appropriate alternative to grid-connected water pumping. The aim of this paper is to assess the costs and benefits of adopting the SPVWPS using data from a field survey of 126 households. The findings show that use of the SPVWPS offers substantial benefits to adopters in the long run. In addition, government subsidy plays a major role in determining the payback period of adopters? investment in the scheme. The paper suggests that, alongside timely implementation of the scheme, the government should facilitate domestic manufacturing of solar cells and panels to fully harness social benefits of the SPVWPS.

The study analyzed the data collected from household survey of about 907 farmers from Western-Terai Landscape Complex of Nepal. Intra-species and inter-species richness and evenness in agriculture landscape were estimated and compared across a spectrum of land-uses. The study identified different social, economic, technological and ecological factors affecting the richness of intra-species and inter-species diversity of agriculture biodiversity using generalized linear regression models. Technology index, information index, food security, animal holding, ethnicity, irrigation facility and land-use were found as major variables affecting agriculture. The results also indicated that buffer zones had higher diversity than other land-uses, indicating positive effects of protected-land on surrounding agriculture biodiversity. Results supported need of coordinated efforts to mainstream agriculture biodiversity conservation with landscape conservation plans and socio-economic developments of the region.

N2  - This study starts by examining the background economic circumstances of the 2007 Water Act and the 2012 Murray Darling Basin Plan. During the 1990s, a competitive Australian dollar contributed to an expansion of some sectors in the Murray Darling Basin, notably wine grapes. From the turn of the millennium, two adverse background events brought difficulties for agriculture in the Basin. First, the millennium drought resulted in reduced irrigation water allocations and contributed to diminished dry-land productivity, notably in 2002-03 and from 2006-07 to 2008-09. Second, the Australian dollar appreciated markedly relative to levels of the 1990s in the wake of the mining boom. This diminished returns to agriculture. In the context of background difficulties, there were mixed responses in Basin communities to the Water Act (McCormick 2007). Some farmers embraced the financial option that arose from proposed buybacks, using proceeds as an opportunity to restructure or retire. Others regarded buybacks as a threat to the viability of Basin communities. Using TERM-H2O, a multi-regional CGE model of Basin regions, previous studies showed that the marginal impacts of buybacks are second-order relative to drought, and can even be positive. A change in political direction has resulted in a suspension of water buybacks, regarded by economists as the cheapest mechanism to increase environmental flows. The Basin Plan is at present concentrating on infrastructure upgrades. An updated version of TERM-H2O shows that a $4 billion program on upgrades between 2020 and 2024 to procure almost 500 GL of water for the environment would result in a net present value (NPV) welfare loss of $1.1 billion. The investment in upgrades increases jobs in the Basin by around 1000 relative to no investment for each of the five years of upgrades. Thereafter, Basin jobs increase by around 100 relative to no upgrades, based on estimated productivity gains arising from the upgrades. This study also models

N2  -  This study aims to empirically determine whether social capital affects farmland transactions in Taiwan. It uses a geographic information system to link the village-level data of the largest national farmland survey with the village-level data of religious groups, which are the most widely distributed civil society organizations. The combined data are analyzed using a spatial self-retrogression model. After controlling for farmland spatial adjacency, an increase in social capital brought an increase in the percentage of active leased farmland and a drop in the percentage of fallow farmland. Analysis of the 2015 cross-sectional data revealed that social capital was strongly conducive to the efficient allocation of farmland resources. While belong to irrigation associations can help to allocate farmland resources (as expected), this allocation is more greatly facilitated by the combination of religion and other traditions. Social capital in Taiwan helped to reduce the density of abandoned farmland, especially Daoist temples in religious communities. This study also used panel data to examine changes in within-village farmland tenancy rates. This analysis found that the identified effects of social capital may decline over time.

N2  - This paper develops and applies a method to value water trading on a river network. The framework relies on regulatory variation in diversion caps to identify production functions for irrigated farms, then uses the estimated shadow values to assess the market's reallocation. I apply this framework to the largest water market in human history, located in southeastern Australia. Observed water trading increased output by 4–6 percent from 2007 to 2015, equivalent to avoiding an 8–12 percent uniform decline in water resources. Reallocation and average surplus both increase substantially during drought, implying that water markets can be most valuable when climatic variability is most severe.

N2  - Based on field work in a village panchayat in Kerala, analyzing the complex issues concerning the development and working of irrigation institutions, the present study reveals that successful management of irrigation is contingent upon the level of participation of the water users in the management. By comparing irrigation institutions under different property rights, the study identifies the significant factors that contribute to the success and sustainability of irrigation institutions. It is found that albeit the physical characteristics of irrigation systems and the heterogeneities of the members of the user groups do impact the outcome, it is the institutional environment as reflected in the presence of clear as well as flexible systems of rules and regulations, enforcement mechanisms, nesting and networking of such institutions etc. that have become the most crucial determinants. For this, presence of able and fair leadership and the manoeuvring of various sources of power are found to be essential.

N2  - Price-based interventions can be corrective where users extract from a common resource, but may also impact existing social norms, often crowding them out. In contrast, I find a pumping fee implemented by a group of irrigators in Southern Colorado effectively crowds-in pro-conservation norms, enhancing the financial incentive's impact. Using a unique, spatially oriented panel-data set of groundwater wells, I separate the direct role of increased pumping costs from the indirect effect transmitted through altered conservation norms. To quantify conservation behavior, I estimate how pumping at one well responds to pumping at nearby wells – using instrumental variables to address simultaneity bias – and interact that behavior with a difference-in-difference framework to assess the influence of the intervention. In the preferred specification, the fee directly accounts for approximately 74% of the reduced pumping and the remaining 26% comes from crowding-in conservation norms.

N2  - Ongoing climate change will increase competition for water. Diversified demand for water-in contrast with the rigid design of water systems, institutions and infrastructure-could hinder the implementation of adaptation policies in water management for Latin American countries. In this context, weather derivatives are proposed as a complementary mechanism for the successful adoption of more efficient water allocations in irrigation districts. Weather derivatives spread risks and incorporate a better understanding of climate system behavior, strengthening irrigation districts¿ ability to deal with water availability and demand. The model uses a dynamic water resource allocation model, historical precipitation and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios to find optimal water allocation strategies for the baseline scenario and in the presence of climate change. This analysis is applied to two irrigation districts in Latin America: one in Mexico and the other in Peru, with their corresponding particularities and results.

N2  - Vietnamese rice production has achieved remarkable success over last decades. By the land and market reforms, known as “Doi Moi”, in which there were noticeable changes in policies such as land and production system were transformed from collective to individual contract system in 1980s, the process of legally privatization of farm properties, huge investment in irrigation system, Vietnam made progress in rice production. The country not only ensured its domestic demand but also started exporting rice and gradually became the second largest exporter in the world. An estimate of the constant elasticity of substitution function (CES) for Vietnam’s rice production is essential for the government to design effective policy on agricultural production. This study makes the first attempt to estimate the nested CES model for Vietnam rice production in 2012. The paper finds that the elasticity of substitution of Vietnam's nested CES model lies between 0.44 to 0.46. The results indicate that the weak substitutability between land and the nest (labor, capital) in the nested CES model. The paper also provides empirical evidence that the nested CES structure in which capital with land are nested inputs and labor plays a role as the third input is rejected. This suggests that it is impossible to take labor as the substitutable factor for land and capital. The findings would partly contribute to design the Vietnam’s effective policies on rice production with the appropriate allocation of inputs factors in order to achieve the optimal output.

Precipitation contracts are designed to help farmers manage risk. Three conclusions originate from the findings. First, the optimal irrigation strategy can greatly increase producers’ certainty-equivalent revenue. Second, changes in water pricing policy would have a limited impact on the amount of water used. And third, across levels of risk preference, the precipitation contracts are not effective in increasing certainty-equivalent revenue or reducing cumulative water use.

We first draw out key stylized facts on our farms, farmers and farming from various granular farmer's administrative data sets that allow us to observe what has happened at the plot, labor and household levels over the past decade, and cover more than 90% of farmers nationwide. We then use a stochastic frontier analysis to identify key drivers of household's agricultural productivity, and project the potential productivity impacts from the four key driving factors: climate change, aging, irrigation and technology for every tambon nationwide. A meta-analysis is then used to illustrate the landscape of technological development throughout the rice value chain in Thailand. Finally, we use lab in the field experiments to understand behavioral insights that underly farmer's incentives particularly in the context of technological adoption. Our results shed some lights on how to design, prioritize and implement policies to ensure that our farmers stay competitive, resilient and sustainable.

N2  - Social uprisings in response to privatization dynamics in the water sector have triggered widespread debate on the social and ecological impact of neoliberal water policies. Much of this debate remains in the urban and domestic water sector, thereby disregarding the struggles of marginalized urban and rural producers who use water for multiple purposes. Furthermore, while private providers are blamed for prioritizing profit over people, it is increasingly clear that while water may be a valuable commodity, the sector as a whole inhibits long-term profitability. Instead, using the concept of â€œaccumulation by dispossession,â€ the current process of privatization is understood as a new round of enclosures of the commons, implemented by a neoliberal state to open up new territories to capitalist development and to capitalist forms of market behavior. The contraction of global markets and the reconfiguration of the public sector as notions of nation and citizenship take on new meanings allow for the commodification and privatization of public goods and assets. Using the case of a Mexican irrigation district the paper shows how notions of scarcity are mobilized during neoliberal reform to reconfigure social relations of agricultural production so as to free up land, water, and labor for the market. This has not only resulted in large-scale dispossession of land and water, but also in stripping a group of their collective rights, and thereby dismantling a collective identity forged on past struggles over land and water.

N2  - We study label framing effects in linear public goods games. By accounting for heterogeneous frame connotation, we can identify individual framing effects. We test for such effects in a field experiment on irrigation management in India. Using membership of the water users association as a proxy for frame connotation, we find a differential impact on contributions in the game. Members contribute relatively more under the irrigation frame than non-members as compared to an alternative, neutral, frame. We conclude that experimental behaviour is sensitive to framing at the individual level but that such individual effects may cancel out on average, which explains previous studies that find mixed or only weak effects of framing.

N2  - California has suffered a four year drought that has imposed severe stress on the state's water resources. Irrigators and urban users have both been affected by unprecedented water restrictions. How should California allocate water? The state has long-standing water allocation issues, as economic mechanisms historically have played little or no role in allocation. USAGE-TERM is a multi-regional CGE model that represents 12 key irrigation counties in California as separate economies. Water trading between irrigators would help California cope with drought. In particular, sales of water from annual crops grower to perennial producers may lower the costs of maintaining plantations, given the high fixed costs arising from the alternative action of drilling new wells. Diverting substantial volumes of irrigation water from plantations to urban users may not be consistent with welfare maximisation.

N2  - Centralized organizations can internalize transaction costs and externalities, addressing possible inefficiencies of decentralized management. In practice, however, centralized organizations can have its own inefficiencies and decentralized management can do relatively well. Empirically testing relative efficiency is difficult because distinct organizations emerge endogenously in various contexts. This paper, in contrast, draws upon the unique history of New Mexico, leveraging a natural experiment to assess how the partial transition in the early 20th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. My results confirm that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33%. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias.

N2  - Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. Drawing on the unique history of New Mexico, I explore how the transition in the early 20 th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. My results confirm that that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33 percent. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias.

N2  - Food problem became more severe after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, presenting a series challenges to India’s agricultural sector. Even during good harvest years, food imports remain high. A large segment of people were poor. To mitigate these problems, India adopted farming strategies under the “Green Revolution” in the mid 1960s. The application of modern farming technology, introduction of high-yielding varieties of seeds, increased use of fertilizers, development and expansion of irrigation systems, extension of credit and educational services to farmers. These activities resulted in a drastic increase of farm products leading India to achieve self-sufficiency in food within a short period of time. The “Green Revolution” has contributed to Indian agriculture tremendously and transformed India from a starving nation to a food exporter. The activities that comprise the “Green Revolution” are worth emulating in the Eritrean environment. This paper explores the impact of the “Green Revolution” on Indian agricultural production with the aim of drawing lessons for Eritrea to modernize its agriculture and subsequently solve its food insecurity problem. The Indian experience serves as a model for Eritrea to achieve self-sufficiency in food.

N2  - This study examines the impact and potential opportunities of groundwater irrigation on rural farm households. Focusing on the size and pattern of the groundwater economy in selected villages located in the hard rock areas of Karnataka, India, the paper argues that the groundwater economy is shrinking due to the depletion of this precious resource. Although investment in groundwater irrigation provides wealth-creating opportunities in addition to helping to meet consumption needs, more often than not, the ongoing need to drill for new wells to counteract severe depletion problems cuts into the investment returns and ultimately affects the pool of assets. Farmers have adopted several coping strategies to overcome the negative externalities of groundwater depletion in this region. Groundwater irrigation has the potential to be a more productive instrument for sustainable rural development in fragile eco-regions. But, in order to make investment in this area a viable option for rural livelihood enhancement, certain policy, institutional factors and other issues need to be addressed.

N2  -  Based on village-level primary household survey in three districts of West Bengal, the present study tries to understand the groundwater market structure using the standard market theory. Comparing the internal rate of return of private investors on groundwater irrigation with past studies, it is found that although the degree of monopoly has gone down in the state over time, a certain element of monopoly still exists in the groundwater market. The estimates of price-to-marginal cost ratios and the Lerner index amply demonstrate the existence of high degree of monopoly in groundwater market. The study also shows that since banks give loans based on collateral, it is the large farmland owners who benefit from these bank loans for installation of electric submersibles for groundwater irrigation. Factors such as availability of rain and canal water, advance payment for water, distance of the land from the irrigation source, and maintenance and labour cost of water extraction mechanism also affect the price of water. As the groundwater extraction increases, it leads to lowering of the groundwater table leading to increasing cost for the water seller who in effect transfers the increasing cost to price leading to a rise in groundwater prices. This is a cause of concern not only for the small and marginal farmers but also for the sustainability of groundwater. JEL Classifications: Q15, D42, Q21

N2  - It is argued that the reason for the ills of irrigation management is the alienation of farmers from the process of planning and implementation. Often 'lack of political will' is identified as the main reason for the tardy progress in irrigation reforms at the state level. Andhra Pradesh has demonstrated the political will by initiating widespread irrigation reforms through legislation. This paper, based on the situation after six years of WUAs in existence, makes an attempt to provide a comprehensive view on the status and functioning of the Water Users' Associations in the State. It is argued that while substantial amounts of money were spent on the reform process, the money was used mainly for improving the ailing irrigation systems rather than strengthening the formal institutional structures. Though some benefits in terms of increased area under irrigation in canal systems and improved quality of irrigation is evident, the sustainability of these benefits is rather uncertain in the absence of efficient institutional structures. Despite the fact that WUAs are promoted as non-political institutions, 'elite capture' and political involvement dominate their functioning. And the present trend appears to be towards further politicization of these institutions. More importantly, even after six years of their existence devolution of powers to WUAs has not taken place, as most of the important functions like assessment, collection of water charges, sanctioning of works, etc., are still in the hands of the irrigation department. In the absence of devolution of powers the WUAs are aiming for political gains rather than improving the systems. It is argued that political will is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for making the WUAs autonomous and self-sufficient. Restructuring and reforming of the State irrigation departments and the bureaucracy is critical for effective and sustainable irrigation institutions.

N2  - This paper evaluates the role of rural infrastructure on the performance of some agricultural crops in Colombia. The study utilizes geo-referenced cross sectional data of four crops, coffee, rice, beans and plantains, collected for the majority of municipalities. Using genetic matching models, we find that both having access to irrigation and drainage systems and better infrastructure for marketing –rural roads and nearby retail and wholesale centers– significantly increase crop yield as well as planted and harvested areas. Results are robust to a suitable set of matching algorithms. The positive and significant impact on agricultural development provides support to reorient agricultural policy towards the supply of public goods that pushes up productivity.

N2  -  The interest in promoting food and water security through development projects has led to the need to evaluate the impact of these projects. This study evaluates the impact from transitioning to a modern irrigation technology. Deciding to adopt or not an alternative irrigation technology (sprinklers) is not necessarily a random determination. Therefore, selection bias can be present and this can lead to biased estimates. In this study, we apply methodological specifications to correct for self-selectivity biases. Then, we measure and compare the technical efficiency scores from adopters and non-adopters. The empirical application uses data covering 56 small-scale greenhouse farms in Crete (Greece) for the cropping years 2009-2013. The results reveal that the average technical efficiency for farmers who adopted sprinkler irrigation is lower than the group of non-adopters, when the presence of selectivity bias cannot be rejected. This implies that either the farmers need more time to incorporate the know-how of the newly acquired technology or they become less motivated after the adoption. Consequently, agricultural water saving technologies need to be promoted in combination with support to the farmers, so they can cope with the lower performance in the first years after adoption.

N2  - This study estimates the impact of major climate variables (temperature and rainfall) on crops’ productivity across four agro-ecological zones of Pakistan. The crops selected were rice, wheat, maize, cotton and sugarcane. The study used panel data from 1991 to 2010 and applied panel least square techniques. The results revealed that the effect of climatic variables on crops yield varied across agro climatic zone due to differences in their climate conditions. Temperature and rainfall were the important determinants affecting crops productivity across agro climatic zones of Pakistan. Wheat productivity has been impacted more in Northern Irrigated Plain-a by average temperature and in Northern Dry Mountains by rainfall than the other zones. Rice productivity has been impacted more in Dry Mountains by average temperature and in the Indus Delta by rainfall than other zones. Sugarcane productivity has been impacted more by average temperature and rainfall in Indus Delta than zone IV. Maize productivity has been impacted more by average temperature and rainfall in Northern Dry Mountains than other zones. Finally the study recommends proper mitigative and adaptative strategies to enhance the positive and lessen the adverse impact of climate change on crops productivity across agro climatic zones of Pakistan.

N2  - Ethiopia has failed to produce enough food to feed its population and the country has remained as one of the developing countries in the world. Irrigation technology has been identified as one of the most priorities in the strategies of the sustainable agricultural productivity in the country. In an effort to address this problem, the government has given due attention for soil and water conservation in the country. However, definitive and quantitative information regarding irrigation technology and its interactions with farm productivity is lacking. We evaluate the impact of irrigation interventions on income generation and food security status of smallholder farm households in East hararghe lowland areas of Ethiopia using cross sectional data collected from randomly selected 200 sample households during 2011/12 production season. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was employed. The logistic regression estimation of factors affecting participation irrigation technology revealed that educational level of the household head, cultivated area, social status, livestock holding, oxen owned and irrigation distance significantly affected the participation decision of households in irrigation. In matching processes, kernel matching with band width of 0.1 was found to be the best matching algorism. This method was also checked for covariate balancing with a standardized bias, t-test, and joint significance level tests. The results revealed that households that participate in irrigation practice have got an improvement of 34 percent and 48percent in calorie intake and farm income than those households that were not participated respectively, which shows participation has a significant, positive and robust impact on the outcome variables. Therefore, policy makers and other stockholders should give due attention in irrigation technology.

N2  - A major concern of the Brazilian coffee growers is closely related to the quantitative and qualitative impacts on the coffee sector as a result of possible climate changes, particularly regarding the production of Arabica coffee varieties, which have better beverage quality. This is because low temperatures (below 18 Â° C) or elevated (above 23 Â° C), causes the blocking of the biological functions responsible for the development of coffee tree, resulting in abortion of flowers and consequently in reducing crop yields and grain quality. Moreover, water deficits or poor water distribution (below 1200mm or above 1800mm annually) can also cause damage during flowering and fruiting, and consequent drop in production and final product quality. Among the available solutions to minimize the negative effects of climate change, stand irrigation, forestation and new varieties of coffee. Irrigation and trees can be used to circumvent both excess heat and cold as well as to protect the crops from frost. Among the technologies developed at the Agronomic Institute - IAC throughout its 126 years of research on coffee, just stand out studies on irrigation and forestation and development of varieties like ObatÃ£, which has shown good prospects for production in hot regions, traditionally considered marginal for the production of Arabica coffee, since accompanied by irrigation. However, the effects that have been observed with the use of production systems irrigated and shaded, and the cultivation ObatÃ£ not yet been quantified. As a result, this study aims to quantify the environmental, economic and social changes that have resulted from use of those technologies in certain regions of Brazil. To scale the impacts of those technologies we have developed a system consisting of a set of indicators aimed at evaluation of the contribution of technological innovation to environmental, social and economic development of an agricultural activity.

N2  - Do farm households taking steps to adapt to climate change experience a higher income than those who do not? This paper aims to answer this question in the context of crop and livestock income in the Savanna region of Togo. To that end, we build a bio-economic model based on farm household model theory. Using survey data collected from a sample of 450 farm households in the agricultural year 2012-2013, we identify farm household types through cluster analysis and apply them in the simulation model. From the results, we conclude that at their current costs, soil and water conservation techniques and irrigation can on average provide higher income even under climate change. The policy message we draw from this study is to encourage soil and water conservation techniques and sustainable irrigation as sound strategies for higher income under climate change in the region.

N2  - We estimate the economic impacts of irrigation using the panel data set from rural Thailand. We employed difference-in-differences estimation and showed that tertiary irrigation has unexpected impacts. Contrary to the local experts predicitions that it should have substantial productivity impacts as it allows better water controls for farmers, we found largely zero profitability impacts. Another unexpected finding is that, while profitability is not affected, we see an increase in cultivation probability with the construction of tertiary canals. This is observed in both wet and dry seasons. This finding suggests that Thai farmers are willing to expand operation scale once they get water.

N2  - This paper attempts to estimate the impacts of Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) irrigation system on modern varieties (MV) of paddy production in Bangladesh. This study was conducted using primary data. A total of 140 MV boro producers were randomly selected from Manoharpur village of Monirampur Upazila in the district of Jessore, of which 70 farmers used the advanced AWD irrigation technique and the remaining used traditional irrigation techniques in cultivating MV boro paddy. Information on inputs and output of MV boro paddy cultivation was collected through a structured questionnaire. The study findings indicate that AWD farmers used less chemical fertilisers (with the exception of TSP) such as urea, MP, Gypsum and Zinc compared to farmers using traditional irrigation. Moreover, the amount of chemical fertiliser used also varied significantly within the same farming system. The farmers used almost similar proportions of temporary hired and family (male and female) labour for MV boro paddy cultivation under both irrigation systems. However, per hectare yield of MV boro paddy, revenue and profit were significantly higher in farms that used the AWD irrigation technique. In addition, farmers using the AWD irrigation technique used excessive irrigation and urea per hectare compared to their traditional counterparts. AWD results in approximately 10 per cent increase in productivity. Another 4 per cent increase was due to differences in quantities of inputs used in the study area.

A total of 120 randomly sampled households were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results showed that the average land holding size, irrigated land holding size, livestock holding, income from agriculture, and investment of household income in agriculture to be higher in non-migrating households than in migrating households, whereas total household income was higher in migrating households than in non-migrating ones. The marginal value productivity of labor was lower for major crops than the average wage rate for non-farm work. The size of abandoned land was higher in migrating than non-migrating households. The average share of remittances in household income was 62.50% in migrating households. Out-migration affected the total annual gross agricultural production significantly contributing 16.80 percent to the total variation negatively. A large proportion of the remittances were used for consumption purposes, but only 5% was used in agriculture. Findings of this study reveal that although migration has a positive effect on the overall economy in the rural households, agricultural productivity suffers as a result.

N2  - Global freshwater demand is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, making water one of the most fiercely contested resources on the planet. Water is linked to many economic activities, and there are complex channels through which water affects economic growth. The purpose of this report is to provide background information useful for a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water scarcity on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The paper provides a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and economic growth, and identifies the possibilities and bottlenecks in incorporating water use into a CGE framework. It covers agricultural water consumption, with special attention to irrigation, water use in energy production, and demands for water by households, industry and services. Finally, it discusses water supply and allocation. Based on the evidence assembled, there appear to have been relatively few instances in which water scarcity has significantly slowed the long term rate of national economic growth. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across the board are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. The presence of large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium analysis. But implementation of a global CGE model with detailed representation of water demand and supply will be a significant undertaking. It is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model, treat water as both an input and an output, and add sectoral detail, with special attention to crop irrigation. Furthermore, there are cha

N2  - Farmers often buy water using fixed fees—rather than with marginal prices. We use two randomized controlled trials in Bangladesh to study the relationship between marginal prices, adoption of a water-saving technology, and water usage. Our first experiment shows that the technology only saves water when farmers face marginal prices. Our second experiment finds that an encouragement to voluntarily convert to hourly pumping charges does not save water. Taken together, efforts to conserve water work best when farmers face marginal prices, but simply giving an option for marginal pricing is insufficient to trigger water-saving investments and reduce irrigation demands.

N2  - Katharine Coman's &quot;Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,&quot; published in March 1911 in the first issue of the American Economic Review addressed issues of water supply, rights, and organization. These same issues have relevance today 100 years later in face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide as demand grows and as supplies become more uncertain due to the potential effects of climate change. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth re-allocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty. This institutional path dependence illustrates how past arrangements to meet conditions of the time constrain contemporary economic opportunities. They cannot be easily significantly modified or replaced ex post.

N2  - We show that societies with a history of irrigation-based agriculture have been less likely to adopt democracy than societies with a history of rainfed agriculture. Rather than actual irrigation, the empirical analysis is based on how much irrigation potentially can increase yields. Irrigation potential is derived from a range of exogenous geographic factors, and reverse causality is therefore ruled out. Our results hold both at the cross-country level, and at the subnational level in premodern societies surveyed by ethnographers.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture makes societies more likely to be ruled by authoritarian regimes. Ancient societies have long been thought to follow this pattern. We empirically show that irrigation affects political regimes even in the present. To avoid endogeneity, we use geographical and climatic variation to identify irrigation dependent societies. We find that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are about six points less democratic on the 21-point polity2 scale than countries where agriculture has been rainfed. We find qualitatively similar results across regions within countries. We argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more powerful and better able to oppose democratization. Consistent with this conjecture, we show that irrigation dependence predicts land inequality both at the country level, and in premodern societies surveyed by ethnographers.

N2  - We study the long-term impact of large-scale irrigation infrastructure on the composition of local economic activity in India. Our analysis uses high-resolution spatial data covering approximately 150,000 villages and towns and exploits spatial discontinuities in the coverage of irrigation projects. Irrigation increases agricultural output, wealth, and population density in rural villages. However, in towns it reduces population and nightlight density, the size of the non-agricultural sector, and large-firm activity. These results highlight the heterogeneous impacts that agricultural productivity gains can have on the patterns local economic development.

N2  - Irrigation is a lynchpin of rural development strategies and a key input to improving productivity and farm incomes, the key source of livelihood for the majority of the world's poor. Limited land and growing water scarcity mean that establishing systems to maximise the benefits from every drop is pivotal. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a canal irrigation project for smallholders in the Philippines, focusing on rice, one of the world's most water intensive crops. We contribute to two strands of literature by combining impact evaluation and efficiency analysis methods. Using a dataset for 714 treatment and 440 control farm parcels, we apply Propensity Score Matching and a selectivity-corrected Stochastic Production Frontier to handle biases from both observable and unobservable variables. We then analyse technical efficiency (TE) and frontier output using a shared Stochastic Meta-Frontier. We find that the project had a statistically significant impact on frontier output but not on TE, suggesting that improved irrigation technology increased beneficiaries' production potential, but it did not improve TE likely due to insufficient training and input access. Thus, beneficiaries were unable to take full advantage of their improved production potential, highlighting the need for suitable complementary support in future projects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main beneficiaries were downstream parcels, smaller parcels, those located in the poorer project district, and farmers with lower education, all implying a pro-poor impact. Finally, we find that female-headed households benefitted less from the project, suggesting the need for additional support in future interventions.

N2  - This paper deals with the problems of estimating irrigation water demand. We propose an original method of estimation in two steps. First, we develop a dynamic programming model in order to explain the optimal irrigation management plan. Based on a microeconomic approach describing the farmer's behavior, this economic model, introducing an agronomic model, and an algorithm of solution search, is used to compute a realistic database. Second, these data are used to estimate profit functions by a non-parametric method. The irrigation water demand function is estimated using a non-parametric derivation procedure.An application to irrigation water demand is proposed in the southwestern area of France where conflicts appear frequently. The same results appear for different climates: for small quantities of water available, irrigation water demand seems to be quite inelastic. If one increases the total quantity of water available, the shape of the curve changes and the demand appears more elastic. The threshold price at which the changes in price-responsiveness appears, depends on weather conditions and range from 0.30 F/m3 in a wet year to 1.60 F/m3 in a dry year. These results are crucial information for the regulator in order to analyze the effects of a water regulation policy, based on prices. The impact of an increase in the water price will depend not only on the climate but also on the location of the initial and final prices on the demand function.JEL classification: C14, C16, Q15

N2  -  A positive mathematical programming model was constructed in this study to assess the effect of three water pricing scenarios on Teboulba’s agricultural production systems. The effects of these scenarios were estimated for three groups of farmers from three irrigated districts. Results show that water demand in group 1 remains inelastic until achieving the price of 0.20 TD. A price above this level decreases water consumption, farmer’s incomes as well as seasonal labor demand. For groups 2 and 3, the water demand curves remain highly inelastic even with a full cost recovery price. However, once reaching this last price, the model shows important income reductions reaching 20% of the current observed income. Moreover, a pricing policy aiming to recover operational and maintenance costs and which will be implemented independently from other economic, social and environmental measures can threaten the sustainability of the production systems in the region.

N2  - Egypt's irrigation systems are inefficient; the use of water is profligate and soil salinity levels have risen. This has reduced agricultural yields and biased production patterns away from high value crops in favour of salt resistant crops. The need to improve irrigation water quality is accentuated by increasing demand for, and declining supplies of, water resources. This study uses a Computable General Equilibrium model, calibrated to an extended SAM and detailed satellite accounts for water quality, to assess the impacts of the huge investments needed to raise water quality. The results indicate strong positive economy-wide impacts in Egypt, which exceed the investment cost. Income increases by 4% and induce increases in the production of high-value crops; i.e., fruits (almost triple), seasonal vegetables (30–37%) and rice by (13%) with a 64% increase in rice exports. The study illustrates the importance of including water quality as a variable in the analyses of water systems.

N2  - The debate on the land-poverty nexus is inconclusive, with past research unable to identify the causal dynamics. We use a unique global panel dataset that links survey and census derived poverty data with measures of land ecosystems at the subnational level. Rainfall is used to overcome the endogeneity in the land-poverty relationship in an instrumental variable approach. This is the first global study using quasi-experimental methods to uncover the degree to which land improvements matter for poverty reduction. We draw three main conclusions. First, land improvements are important for poverty reduction in rural areas and particularly so for Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, land improvements are pro-poor: poorer areas see larger poverty alleviation effects due to improvements in land. Finally, irrigation plays a major role in breaking the link between bad weather and negative impacts on the poor through reduced vegetation growth and soil fertility.

N2  - Backward agriculture, inadequate farm income and absolute poverty have long characterized the economy of developing countries. Unequal distribution of agricultural land is often cited as a source of poverty and inefficiency in agriculture. However, much of literature on smallholders tends to address income inequality and (total) land size, while land inequality has been overlooked in those discourses. In view of filling the research gap, this paper provides a micro-level foundation for discussions on land inequality and food security in Laos as a case study for least developed countries. Using detailed primary data of farm households from Phongsaly, one of the poorest provinces in northern Laos, the study decomposes agricultural land into three types, namely irrigated lowland, rain-fed lowland and upland, and evaluates the effect of uneven distribution and quality of land on food security. A significant contribution of the paper consists in that land inequality is controlled for and access to agricultural infrastructure is measured by irrigated area. The study reveals that landholdings - regardless of types of land - improve rice self-sufficiency, and that superior land quality - irrigated or rain-fed lowland - enhances food security of farm households. The findings pertain to impact of land policy (allocation, utilization and management of agricultural land) on food security and poverty alleviation.

N2  - The land integration and titling policy (LITP) is a grassroots innovation for implementing a top-down land titling policy (LTP) that has critical institutional economic implications. Although the LITP can increase land economies of scale, institutional costs and practical constraints also exist. Specifically, land heterogeneity and fragmentation directly restrict the LITP. This paper uses survey data from 1507 farmers in Yangshan, Guangdong, in 2017 and a logistic semiparametric model to conduct an empirical analysis. The results show that the heterogeneity of geological fertility, irrigation facilities, and farmland rent have a significant negative effect on implementation of the LITP, with geological fertility heterogeneity having the most significant effect. Villages with hilly and mountainous terrain have more difficulty implementing the LITP. The degree of land fragmentation within the land heterogeneity factor significantly inhibits the LITP. Roads for cultivation machines and irrigation facilities significantly promote the implementation of the LITP, and moreover, cultivation-machine roads effectively eliminate the inhibiting effect of land fragmentation on the LITP. The LITP has its own system space, and a good institution always needs an institutional device for smooth promotion. Heterogeneity and the fragmentation of land are hard constraints for integration and titling, but they can be resolved through agricultural production infrastructure. Findings suggest that the joint promotion of a core and a supplementary institution can have great significance for the smooth progress of mandatory institutional changes, e.g., land titling.

N2  - The Spanish collective institutions for irrigation management have become a reiterated reference in the study of common pool resources. However, the success of Spanish irrigators in the local management of water contrasts with an important failure in the management of this common pool resource at the basin scale. During the second half of the ninetieth century, the water users’ associations of the large huertas (market gardens) of eastern Spain seek for the constitution of higher institutions to coordinate water management at the basin or sub-basin level. The aim of this institutional ambition, unsuccessful in this period, was to reduce the number and intensity of conflicts and to achieve a major level of water rights enforcement. This paper describes the case of the Sindicato General de Riegos del Turia, whose short experience (1850-1883) was conditioned by the firm opposition of water users’ from the upper and middle Turia, reluctant to join the institutional project. The design of the institution, previous to the model defined by the Water Law of 1866, was based in the transposition, to the basin level, of the successful principles used at the local management of irrigation. The paper focuses on the analysis of the principles of institutional design followed in the creation of the Sindicato, and explores the importance of the up-scaling processes in the development of nested institutions.

N2  - Decentralization of irrigation management to local communities is often claimed to improve performance. The argument is that decentralization enhances the perceived legitimacy of irrigation management, which in turn increases the willingness of water users to cooperate and contribute to irrigation management. To test this hypothesis, we collected information about water users’ legitimacy perceptions in five villages alongside an irrigation channel in Maharashtra, India. In two of the villages, the irrigation department is in charge of irrigation management, while in the other three villages, this task has been decentralized to local water users associations (WUAs). To assess the impact of legitimacy perceptions on cooperation, we used survey-based indicators of perceived legitimacy to explain three outcomes, each of which partly reflects the willingness of water users to cooperate and contribute to irrigation management: (1) water users’ self-reported charge payments, (2) WUA-reported charge payments, and (3) water users’ behavior in a field experiment that was framed in terms of irrigation management. Our results show that legitimacy perceptions differ between the two types of villages as well as between WUA members and non-members, but these differences do not explain any of the three outcomes. Non-members contribute significantly less under the irrigation frame as compared to WUA members, but game behavior is not correlated with (self-reported or WUA-reported) charge payments. We conclude that decentralization of irrigation management may enhance legitimacy perceptions but this has no effect on the willingness of water users to contribute to irrigation management.

N2  - Agricultural production is heavily dependent on water availability in Turkey, where half the crop production relies on irrigation. Irrigated agriculture consumes about 75 percent of total water used, which is about 30 percent of renewable water availability. This study analyzes the likely effects of increased competition for water resources and changes in the Turkish economy. The analysis uses an economy-wide Walrasian Computable General Equilibrium model with a detailed account of the agricultural sector. The study investigated the economy-wide effects of two external shocks, namely a permanent increase in the world prices of agricultural commodities and climate change, along with the impact of the domestic reallocation of water between agricultural and non-agricultural uses. It was also recognized that because of spatial heterogeneity of the climate, the simulated scenarios have differential impact on the agricultural production and hence on the allocation of factors of production including water. The greatest effects on major macroeconomic indicators occur in the climate change simulations. As a result of the transfer of water from rural to urban areas, overall production of all crops declines. Although production on rainfed land increases, production on irrigated land declines, most notably the production of maize and fruits. The decrease in agricultural production, coupled with the domestic price increase, is further reflected in net trade. Agricultural imports increase with a greater decline in agricultural exports.

N2  - In this paper, the term multi-purpose water infrastructure (MPWI) encompasses all man-made water systems, including dams, dykes, reservoirs and associated irrigation canals and water supply networks, which may be used for more than one purpose (for economic, social and environmental activities). While MPWI plays a significant role in the socio-economic development and ensuring water, food and energy security of many countries (not least in water-stressed Central Asia), many MPWI projects face various challenges. These including unsustainability of business models for financing, operation and maintenance, lower-than-expected performance or the emergence of unforeseen risks and negative externalities. This paper explores the complexity in designing, financing, regulating and managing MPWI projects, with the objective to inform policy and decision-making. It attempts to identify key issues related to managing MPWI, lessons learned from international experience and possible solutions to the challenges. It examines several principles, approaches and instruments to enhance the sustainability of MPWI, drawing on international experience. Finally, the paper identifies knowledge and experience gaps, needs for further research and possible areas of future work.

This study contributes to this debate by explicitly recognizing the endogeneity of institutional changes and uses lagged weather shocks as valid instruments. With improved data on irrigation and mechanization in a provincial-level dataset covering the1970-1987 period, the results of panel GMM estimations reveal that the Household Responsibility System had a significantly positive effect on China's agricultural growth, which is larger than that indicated by OLS estimates..

N2  - This study aims to measure the performance of communal irrigation systems (CIS), using cropping intensity and farm yield as indicators. In particular, the study focused on the importance of collective action and how it affects the performance of CIS as a form of irrigation system in the Philippines. The unit of analysis used is the irrigatorsâ€™ association (IA) that manages a CIS across the province of Bohol, Philippines. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether there are significant differences in the performance indicators among the three IA classifications. Likewise, Tobit analysis and ordinary least squares estimation method were used to determine the significant factors that influence cropping intensity and farm yield as performance indicators. The results showed that excellent-rated associations have significantly higher cropping intensity and farm yield than the satisfactory- and fair-rated associations. With respect to the determinants of the performance indicators, labor contribution as a proxy of collective action, has a positive and significant influence on the performance of the irrigation system. Likewise, farm size and farm location have significant and positive effects on cropping intensity and farm yield. However, firmed-up service area and age of the association is statistically significant in farm yield only. To improve the performance of CISs, the study recommends that both monetary and labor contributions must be promoted among farmer-members of each IA.

N2  -  In a canonical model of collective action, individual contribution to collective action is negatively correlated with group size. Yet, empirical evidence on the group size effect has been mixed, partly due to heterogeneities in group activities. In this paper, we first construct a simple model of collective action with the free rider problem, altruism, public goods, and positive externalities of social networks. We then empirically test the theoretical implications of the group size effect on individual contribution to four different types of collective action, i.e., monetary or nonmonetary contribution to directly or indirectly productive activities. To achieve this, we collect and employ artefactual field experimental data such as public goods and dictator games conducted in southern Sri Lanka under a natural experimental situation where the majority of farmers were relocated to randomly selected communities based on the government lottery. This unique situation enables us to identify the causal effects of community size on collective action. We find that the levels of collective action can be explained by the social preferences of farmers. We also show evidence of free riding by self-interested households with no landholdings. The pattern of collective action, however, differs significantly by mode of activity—collective action that is directly rather than indirectly related to production is less likely to suffer from the free rider problem. Also, monetary contribution is less likely to cause free riding than nonmonetary labor contribution. Unlike labor contributions, monetary contributions involve collection of fees which can be easily tracked and verified, possibly leading to better enforcement of collective action. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.

N2  - Rural roads are built to improve peopleâ€™s mobility and to enhance access to markets, administrative centres, schools and health posts, and are credited with important socio-economic changes. A less studied aspect is the impact of roads on hydrological resources, as roads interact with existing surface and groundwater flows, redistributing water-related hazards and resources across space with significant consequences on people and their livelihoods. In Ethiopia, the government has embarked on a massive road construction programme over the last decade, mainly to serve the needs of an essentially rural population and agrarian economy. In parallel, the government has also been investing significantly in water harvesting and conservation measures and irrigation to serve the needs of a population whose livelihoods depend heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Based on fieldwork conducted in 2014 in the semi-arid region of Tigray, Ethiopia, this article explores the opportunities and potential for multifunctional infrastructures. We argue that the two distinctive objectives of improving road connectivity and water availability for irrigation are interlinked and can be served by the same infrastructure, which we call multifunctional roads.

N2  - Myanmar’s agriculture sector offers substantial unexploited potential to underpin the country’s inclusive economic development. With extensive land, water, and labor resources, as well as proximity to fast-growing markets, the country’s agriculture has key competitive advantages. At the same time, Myanmar’s agricultural productivity trails its neighbors as a result of constraints in input markets, infrastructure, and institutions. Key actions to address these constraints include improving land tenure, expanding credit availability, investing in input markets for nutrients and machinery, developing drainage and irrigation systems, and enhancing rural transport and electricity connectivity. In the short-term, public–private partnerships may help to address these barriers to investment, but increased public investment is vital over the longer term. All these direct actions should be underpinned by investments in innovation and attention to climate change effects as part of comprehensive long-term agricultural development planning.

N2  - A great challenge facing future agricultural water policy is to explore the potential for transition from the current myopic competitive (common) exploitation of groundwater resources to a long-term efficient and sustainable allocation. A number of economic and/or command and control instruments can be used by the relevant water authority in order to deal with the economic and environmental problems generated by competitive exploitation. However, according to previous experience in both developed and developing countries, tradable permits seem as one of the most effective and efficient instruments, especially under conditions of limited water availability. On this account, the aim of the current study is to explore the feasibility and implementation of a tradable permit system in irrigated agriculture. To this end, two distinct optimization models are applied and compared: (a) an individual farmer’s model (representing the myopic non-cooperative exploitation of groundwater) and (b) a social planner’s model (representing the cooperative and sustainable allocation). The deviation of their results shows the rationale for using a tradable permit system, while the final allocation of the social planner’s model, solved as an optimal control problem that maximizes the social welfare under specific water policy objectives, denotes the equilibrium state of this system. The two models are then applied in a typical rural area of Greece where groundwater is the only source of irrigated agriculture. The derived time paths for water consumption and water availability illustrate the significant environmental benefits from the future implementation of a tradable permit system.

N2  - We focus on the interaction between a representative polluting tannery and a negatively impacted small farmer in Kanpur, India. The tannery produces leather and toxic chemical waste that ends up in wastewater used by the small farmer to irrigate agricultural land and grow vegetables. The waste generated by the tannery is functionally related to its output of leather. The small farmer faces a capacity constraint that describes the maximum amount of vegetables he can grow. In this setting, we perform three tasks. First, we determine the optimal production of leather when the tannery does not account for the negative effect it has on the small farmer. Second, on the assumption that the tannery compensates the small farmer per unit of waste it generates, we ascertain the optimal compensation amount, the optimal output of leather, and the profit levels of the tannery and the small farmer. Finally, we compare the solutions in the preceding two cases and explain what accounts for the differences between them.

N2  - Slow agricultural development has restrained economic growth and poverty alleviation in Cambodia. The country's volatile history has left a legacy of weak tenure security and large areas of underutilized land. This study estimates the impact of access to land on poverty in a logistic regression framework using household survey data. Increased access to land is shown to significantly lower the risk of household poverty. Tenure security, land improvements and irrigation strengthens this effect. Simulations of the potential impact of a land reform package predicts a 16 percentage points fall in poverty incidence among landowning rural households and a 30-point fall when targeting the landless. The analysis suggests that improved tenure security should be at the top of the policy agenda. Given political and economic constraints, implementation of reforms remains a key challenge.

N2  - Soil erosion is serious economic and environmental concern. Assessing soil erosion risk in the Alqueva dam watershed is urgently needed to conserve soil and water resources and prevent the accelerated dam siltation, taking into account the possible land-use changes, due to tourism development, intensification of irrigated farming and biomass production, as well as climate change. A comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with geostatistical techniques was adopted to study different land-use and management scenarios. The main objective of this study stage is to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of an agro-silvo pastoral system. The resultant soil erosion map shows an average of 14.1 t/ha/ year, with serious erosion risk (higher than 50 t/ha/year) in 4.3% of area. The highest values are associated mainly to high slopes and low vegetation. The final prediction maps for soil erosion and for each factor considered, can be used as a solid base to create a Decision Support System so as to provide specific procedures for decision-makers, promoting for sustainability of the ecosystems, reducing the risk of erosion and consequently increase lifetime of dam, under various land use and management scenarios

N2  - Climate change is predicted to bring changes in weather and water availability. The effect on agriculture depends on the ability of producers to modify their practices in response to changing distributions. We develop a two-stage theoretical model of planting and irrigation decisions and use a unique dataset to empirically estimate how producers respond to changes in expected water availability and deviations from expectations. As water supplies decrease, producers respond by planting fewer acres and concentrating the application of water. Highlighting the importance of adaptation in this context, failure to account for this behavioral response overstates climate change impacts by 17%.

N2  -  In most developing countries non-irrigation status often dominates adoption of traditional and modern irrigation technology. In this paper, we study the effect of production risk on irrigation technology choice among small-scale farmers in Chile, applying sample selection and discrete choice models. We find that more educated farmers, with credit access, receiving extension services, and living in communes with more adopters are more likely to use modern irrigation techniques. Moreover, production risk is often associated with adoption of traditional irrigation, and this risk often undermines a shift to more modern irrigation systems. Controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation choices clearly improves our understanding of small-scale farmer irrigation adoption decisions and we argue that weaker knowledge about and lower automatic diffusion of modern irrigation is a main obstacle for improving small-scale farmer productivity.

N2  - Wind erosion is detrimental to agriculture. Planting shelterbelt trees is a common strategy to protect vulnerable areas. I estimate the impact of shelterbelts on agriculture while instrumenting the endogeneity of planted location with a designated zone under the Great Plains Shelterbelt Project—a massive tree-planting operation implemented in 1935–1942. I find a shift from cropland to pasture associated with higher shelterbelt coverage due to differential productivity changes in livestock and crop production. The revenue increase from livestock was contributed by cattle, while the decline in crop production mainly occurred in western counties owing to obstacles to adopting new irrigation technology.

N2  - The Water Framework Directive requires a public participation into the new water planning process. This paper develops an analysis of the public opinion about the irrigated agriculture in Castilla y León as a previous step for the design of an active and successful participation process. In order to do so, a survey has been conducted addressing environmental and social effects of irrigated agriculture and the different instruments available for public management of these agricultural systems. The results show how regional public opinion considers positively the irrigated agriculture because of its contributions to social welfare. However, it is thought that the budget burden required for the transformation and the maintenance of these kind of agricultural systems could be used more efficiently in other public policies. As a consequence, regional society refuses policies based on transforming new areas into irrigation. Opposite, it is demanded a more strict regulatory policy that minimizes its environmental impact in the region.

N2  - This paper evaluates the effects of a public groundwater provision program on water tables in Northern India. I theorize that public provision leads to sustainable use of groundwater when the fixed costs for private well provision are high. I use village-level longitudinal data on aquifers and wells, and exploit the physical and technological limitations of surface pumps that generate a cost difference at a specific water depth to test this model. My findings suggest that public provision can be used as an alternative in scenarios where prohibitive monitoring costs might preclude the use of other regulatory approaches to prevent over-extraction.

N2  - Resource scarcity has become an increasingly pressing challenge to the world. How scarcity affects people’s preferences and behavior has been taken as an important issue for development. This study examines the impact of long-term exposure to resource scarcity on farmers’ cooperation. Specifically, we focus on water scarcity in irrigation agriculture, and examine the effect of water scarcity on cooperation in the context of a gravity irrigation system in western China. A historical irrigation water quota system provides an opportunity to measure exogenous variations of water scarcity within an otherwise homogeneous region. We use the ratio of the arable land area to the irrigation water quota of each village as our measure of water scarcity. Moreover, we use the contributions in a public goods game to measure the farmers’ willingness to cooperate. Combining a household survey and a lab-in-the-field experiment with 312 rural residents in northwestern China, we find that irrigation water scarcity significantly increases farmers’ willingness to cooperate. The results are robust to potential endogeneity concerns and many confounding factors. We also find that water scarcity is positively correlated with irrigation management activities and canal conditions. Our findings provide important policy implications for common pool resource management and collective actions in rural communities.

N2  - In the famous “anti-Commons” theory, resources are underused when multiple owners are endowed with the right to exclude other potential users, in contrast to the “Commons” theory that identifies resource over-exploitation. In this crucial preliminary study, “Intestate Succession” (i.e. “Succession without Will”) is under investigation, thus evaluating whether the number of land cotenants (heirs, in “Intestate Succession”) affects significantly (or not) land market values, by taking into account certain significant economic variables, representing the whole population official and primary data, officially available from the municipal Serres Farmlands. Applying advanced GLM, we perform ANCOVA analysis, considering as dependent variable the market land value. We find that, controlling for the objective land value (IRS land value), location, irrigation, farmer identity, and land segmentation-fragmentation all affect significantly the market land value variable. Significantly, the number of heirs does not seem to be a significant factor yet in the context of the “anti-Commons” theory.

N2  - Irrigation provides insurance against aggregate weather shocks, which can interact with other institutions functioning in village communities. I study this relationship in a model of joint co-operation over irrigation and risk sharing under limited commitment. The model dynamics show that if access to irrigation can be regulated by villagers, the two institutions reinforce each other. However, non-excludable irrigation crowds out risk sharing (as is the case with government-managed irrigation). I estimate the framework on data from three villages in India and use it to quantify the relationship between informal insurance and irrigation, and the welfare impact of irrigation public policy.

N2  -  This paper investigates the effect of social capital between irrigation canal head-enders and tail-enders on their water allocation problem. In irrigation management, the water allocation problem between head-enders and tail-enders is one of the serious problems. Using unique natural and artefactual field experiment data as well as general household survey data collected by JICA, this study finds that social capital, especially trust toward their tail-enders, has a significantly positive effect on satisfaction with water usage among head-enders. Considering the fact that the incentive structure of irrigation water allocation for head-enders closely resembles that in the dictator and trust games, this finding also supports the validity of experimentally measured social capital. In addition, this study deals with the simultaneity bias between satisfaction level and experimentally measured social capital, and finds that OLS estimators are downward biased, which is consistent with the hypothesis that scarcity of resources enhances social capital.

N2  - Although social capital is considered to be a key instrument for common pool resource (CPR) management, its effect among heterogenous players such as upstream and downstream farmers along an irrigation canal is not clear. Using a combination of lab-in-the-field experiments to measure social capital and household survey data in a unique natural experimental setting, this study shows that upstream farmers with higher trust toward the downstream farmers are more likely to be satisfied with their water usage. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that upstream farmers with higher trust demand less water and leave more water in a canal because they expect reciprocal behaviour from downstream farmers. Since the incentive structures of irrigation management closely resemble those of the standard experiments to measure social capital, this finding also provides a unique case study of the real-world relevance of these experiments.

N2  - In Vietnam, all lands belong to the state, which assigns usufruct rights to those lands to individuals and households. In 1993, the state gave 20-year usufruct rights to growers of annual crops, and 50-year usufruct rights to growers of perennial crops. In 2013, as the usufruct rights of growers of annual crops were about to expire, the Vietnamese government passed a law—the Land Law of 2013—that extended the usufruct rights of all landowners by 50 years. We exploit this largely unanticipated shock to study the effect of tenurial security on agricultural investment. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the Land Law of 2013 is associated with a higher likelihood of investment by growers of annual crops in irrigation technology or soil and water conservation, but not other types of investment. Our results are robust to controlling for endogenous switching from annual to perennial crops, and our data support the parallel trends assumption.

N2  - This paper summarizes and synthesizes the role of markets in facilitating climate change adaptation. It explains how market signals encourage adaptation through land markets. It also identifies impediments to critical market signals, provides related policy recommendations, and points to promising new technologies. Urban, coastal, and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change. These signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and by policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs. In agriculture, they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices, seed types, timing, and location of production. They also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies. In urban areas, they motivate new housing construction, elevation, and location away from harm. They channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures. To be effective, however, land markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust. Where these conditions are not met, land market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced. Because public policy is driven by constituent demands, it may not be a remedy. The evidence of the National Flood Insurance Program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive.

N2  - Markets, especially land markets, can facilitate climate change adaptation through price signals. A review of research reveals that urban, coastal, and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change. These signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs. In agriculture, they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices, seed types, timing, and location of production. They also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies. In urban areas, they motivate new housing construction, elevation, and location away from harm. They channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures. Related water markets play a similar role in adjusting water use and reallocation. To be effective, however, markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust. Where these conditions are not met, market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced. Because public policy is driven by constituent demands, it may not be a remedy. The evidence of the National Flood Insurance Program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive.

N2  - The economic impact of global warming likely varies across farms because of differences in climate, technology, and adaptive capacity. Therefore, aggregate estimates of the average effect of warming may be insufficient to model climate change vulnerability. In this study, I propose a quantile model for the distributional effect of climate change. I estimate interquantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 °C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation.

N2  - This study employs a difference-in-differences framework to assess the effectiveness of the 2008–2012 pilot phase of the Kansas Water Right Transition Assistance Program at reducing either groundwater or surface water use. We distinguish between two program components: creek subbasins and designated High Priority Areas. Results demonstrate that water right retirement in the High Priority Areas substantially reduced groundwater use. Regardless of the program component, we find no effect on surface water use. Our conclusions are robust to various specifications. This study is the first to directly estimate the effect of water right retirement or any form of restriction on irrigation-related water rights.

N2  - With EU accession, Romania must comply with policies and directives related to agriculture and rural development, and adapt to it' s own legislation and agricultural policy. According to EU policies and directives, Romania oriented his own policy toward farms and various forms of their association, as the main beneficiaries of state aid for agriculture and hence for irrigation. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the Romanian national strategies for land improvement in the context of conditioning aid application to the recovery of the costs of water services including those relating to the environment. There are also presented the reality of the Romanian agricultural land improvement sector in general and of the Covurlui Plateau agricultural land improvement, in particular. Considering the real issues of land improvement sector in Romania we conclude that it can not take full account of the principle of cost recovery from the direction of Irrigation beneficiaries (farmers and their associations), so long as the alternative would be the destruction of Irrigation and fall of agricultural activity in Romania.

N2  - Agriculture on the American Plains has been constrained historically by water scarcity. Post-WWII technologies enabled farmers over the Ogallala aquifer to extract groundwater for large-scale irrigation. Comparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties, groundwater access increased agricultural land values and initially reduced the impact of droughts. Over time, land use adjusted toward water intensive crops and drought sensitivity increased. Viewed differently, farmers in nearby water-scarce areas maintained lowervalue drought-resistant practices that fully mitigate naturally higher drought sensitivity. The evolving impact of the Ogallala illustrates the importance of water for agricultural production, but also the large scope for agricultural adaptation to groundwater and drought.

Degree days, a non-linear transformation of the climatic variables suggested by agronomic experiments as more relevant to crop yield gives an improved fit and increased robustness. Estimated coefficients are consistent with the experimental results. The model is employed to estimate the potential impacts on farmland values for a range of recent warming scenarios. The predictions are very robust and more than 75% of the counties in our sample show a statistically significant effect, ranging from moderate gains to large losses, with losses in the aggregate that can become quite large under scenarios involving sustained heavy use of fossil fuels.

The analysis is based on two data sources- the first is a unique district-season level panel dataset that we construct using multiple sources- and the second is unit-record data from the NSS Employment Unemployment Surveys. To identify causal effects, we employ a difference-indifference matching (DIDM) procedure, where districts are matched based on propensity scores- the use of propensity scores represents a novel aspect of this paper. We also examine pre-programme trends for each outcome variable to provide a check on the validity of our estimates. Our results indicate modest changes in cropping patterns that are state- and period-specific- however they do not indicate any improvements in crop yields that were expected given the MGNREGA’s focus on investments in irrigation, although there is some evidence that irrigated area may have expanded after a lag. We also find that there is no systematic evidence of impact on wages, and therefore no evidence that public works employment in MGNREGA crowded out casual labour in agriculture.

N2  - Decentralization of irrigation management is claimed to improve performance by enhancing legitimacy and, thus, increasing cooperation. We test this hypothesis by collecting information about water users’ legitimacy perceptions and assessing the impact of these perceptions on irrigation charge payments and behavior in a framed field experiment. Our results show that legitimacy perceptions differ between communities and between water users association members and non-members but that these differences do not explain charge payments nor behavior in the irrigation treatment of the game. We conclude that decentralization may enhance legitimacy perceptions but that this does not necessarily increase cooperation in irrigation management.

N2  - How natural resources are measured and bounded within a property right system can influence their development and productivity. This is especially true for surface water given its fluid, fungible, and stochastic nature. Two quantifications have emerged: The prior appropriation doctrine provides absolute quantities to water allocated based on first use while proportional water rights distribute a set percentage of total water to owners. While theoretical differences have been identified, empirical tests are scarce due to the endogenous choice of water rights. I identify and utilize a natural experiment where acequias (Hispanic-rooted irrigation ditches) developed in Territorial New Mexico are later divided by the formation of Colorado, exogenously compelling that subset to be subject to the priority system while those in New Mexico continue to practice proportional division. Drawing on a broad compilation of archival, administrative, satellite, hydrological, and survey data, I find priority rights curtail investment for later irrigators, but that the marginal product of water is generally lower under that right system. This research advances our understanding of how distinct property right systems affect resource development and use. The results can guide stakeholders devising or reforming rights to a resource, particularly ones with stochastic flows.

N2  - Agricultural groundwater use is increasingly being restricted to address the negative impacts of pumping on instream flows for downstream users, endangered species habitat, and recreation. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of the costs of water use restrictions to farmers is critical to evaluating the effectiveness of current and alternative water management policies. We use a geospatial population dataset of irrigation wells in the Republican River Basin of Nebraska and model the simultaneous crop choice, land and water use decisions at a well level. We estimate the magnitude and distribution of costs of current groundwater restrictions as well as cost savings from alternative market-based policies that allow trading of permits between farmers. Our analysis highlights the importance of the initial distribution of permits and the institutional context in which trading occurs. Both allocated but unused permits and land estimated to move from irrigated to dryland crops provide important trading volume into the water rights market. The results show that the cost savings from allowing trading of groundwater pumping rights are distributed unevenly between wells, counties, and groundwater management institutions.

N2  - By providing more public goods (irrigation), collective agriculture can deal with negative weather shocks more effectively. Yet, collective institutions are fraught with problems of work incentives, excessive grain procurement, and the like, which in one extreme historical instance had resulted in great tragedy—China's Great Leap Famine. By exploiting the variation in the pace of agricultural decollectivization among the Chinese provinces during 1978–1984, we test the respective effects of weather shocks, the lasting impact of the Great Leap Famine, and public goods provision on the villages' institutional choice between collective and family farming. We find that bad weather at the time of decollectivization had the likely effect of strengthening the collectives, but that effect reverses in provinces that had experienced greater famine severity or had enjoyed better public goods provision.

N2  - Constitutionally in India, the individual states have responsibility for water, forests, and agriculture. Major canal irrigation accounts for over 80 percent of India's irrigation. The intensive wheat irrigated system in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states of India is observed to analyze the impact of incentive mechanism favoring the crop yield and water use. The regions selected for the present study are built on a long tradition of canal irrigation. Findings from farm surveys are used to examine water management and water productivity in the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh state. Attributes of the irrigation sources help explain the widespread interest in groundwater use and the relative demise of canal water use. Sole consumption of groundwater as irrigation source was altered by the initiation of conjunctive water of both surface and ground through the incentive pathway by municipal level irrigation managers. A combination of technological, land use and market based approaches is likely to be most effective in achieving sustainable water management in these intensive cereal systems. Based on the data set for the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the overall goal of this paper was to examine how the irrigation management reform has proceeded since the early stages of implementation and what the impacts are of the incentive mechanisms on water use and crop yields. The results show that irrigation management reform has accelerated in the study sites. The econometric model results indicate that using incentive mechanisms to promote water savings is effective under the arrangement of contracting management. However, if incentives are provided to the irrigation managers, the wheat yield declines significantly. The results imply that at the later stage of the reform, the cost of reducing water use by providing incentives to managers includes negative impacts on crop yields. Therefore, the design of win–win supporting policies is aimed to be achieved from the present study to ensure the heal

Agriculture has been identified as a strategic sector and environmental objectives are progressively integrated into the reformed agricultural policy. The use of models and tools is recommended in the WFD to support the implementation process of the Directive. This paper first briefly clarifies the policy context, then considers tools and models applied in Italy to water management and agriculture. Recommendations are then presented on how tools should be used, taking the Trebbia irrigation district experience in the Po valley as an example, where a participatory process supports the Irrigation Board in preparing the water conservation plan.

N2  - The paper reports the results of an empirical study on profitability of rice cultivation in the East Calcutta Wetlands (ECW) region where untreated sewage from the city of Kolkata (earlier Calcutta), India, is used for the purpose of irrigation during the winter/summer crop. The results show that plots using wastewater containing organic nutrients earn lower profits than those using groundwater. We also find that the profitability of plots using wastewater is negatively affected by the presence of heavy metals such as Lead and Mercury that are carried through untreated sewage-water canals and deposited in the soil. Of the two opposing effects of wastewater irrigation, the negative effect of heavy metal toxicity outweighs the positive effects of organic nutrients. The results support regulation of the discharge of the heavy metals like Lead and Mercury into the wastewater from households and industries. This would lead to conservation of the Wetlands generating a number of ecological and environmental benefits to the society.

N2  - Irrigation is a key determinant of agricultural productivity, income, and sustainable development. This paper estimates the impact of the National Irrigation Program with a Watershed Approach (PRONAREC) on the value of agricultural production, investments in complementary technologies, household income, and water resource management in rural communities in Bolivia. We use a unique cross-sectional data set collected from a sample of 1,682 farmers (583 beneficiaries and 1,099 controls) for the 2014-2015 agricultural cycle. To evaluate the effects of the program, we exploit special features of the program design by comparing two rounds of program participants: treated communities are those that received the program first, while control communities are those that were in the pipeline to receive the treatment at a later period. The strategy controls for program placement and self-selection bias at the community level, and we control for self-selection based on observable characteristics with the implementation of Propensity Score Matching. The results show that participation in the program improved the value of agricultural production, and it triggered a deeper process of technological change that led to investments in complementary inputs. Additionally, there is evidence PRONAREC has strengthened farmers’ access to markets, increased household incomes, promoted the formalization of water users’ associations, and improved the organization and management of irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the lack of effects on agricultural productivity suggests program beneficiaries are in the upward sloping curve of the learning process

N2  - The data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was used to estimate the technical efficiency (TE) scores, the Malmquist total factor productivity (TFP) indices, and their implicit input shadow shares for 12 irrigation districts in Southern Alberta using data for the period 2008–12. The main purpose was to establish benchmarks so that future increases in conservation, efficiency and total factor productivity of water use (major goals of Alberta’s Water for Life strategy) can be assessed. Results of an input-oriented DEA model indicated that the irrigation districts were, on average, 84.3 % technically efficient in their input use, primarily the net water diverted. The output-oriented model indicated that the irrigation districts, alternatively, could expand their total irrigated areas by 58.3 % with the current level of input use. Over the period 2008–12, the year-to-year mean Malmquist TFP for the irrigation districts of Southern Alberta was estimated to be 0.98 %. Net water diverted was identified as the most important contributing input (76 %) to the TFP change. The second and third contributing factors were pivot irrigation technology (6 %) and precipitation (5 %). Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014

N2  - Water is critical for agriculture, yet surprisingly few studies internationally have analysed the value placed on water in specific farming contexts. We do so using a rich longitudinal dataset for the Mackenzie District (Canterbury, New Zealand) over nineteen years, enabling us to extract the value placed by farmers on long-term access to irrigated water. New Zealand has a system of water consents under the Resource Management Act (RMA) that enables farmers with consents to extract specified quantities of water for agricultural purposes. Some water is extracted through large-scale irrigation infrastructure and other flows by more localised means; the RMA and the water consents themselves are a critical legal infrastructure underpinning farming. Using panel methods, we estimate property sale price and assessed value as a function of the size of the farm's water right (if it has one), farm characteristics, and the water right interacted with farm characteristics to determine how the value of a water consent varies according to local conditions. We find that flatter areas and areas with poorly draining soils benefit most from irrigation, possibly because the water is retained for longer on these properties. Drier areas appear to benefit more from irrigation than do areas with higher rainfall. Farms that are situated close to towns derive especially strong benefits from irrigation since these properties are most likely to have potential water-intensive land uses such as dairying and cropping that require access to processing facilities and/or an urban labour pool.

N2  - This paper evaluates the impact of access to groundwater on poverty using data from rural India. The estimation exploits the fact that the technology required to access groundwater changes exogenously due to constraints imposed by laws of physics at a depth of eight meters. I find that rural poverty in areas where depth from surface is below the cutoff is 9 to 10 percent higher. Using survey data for a subsample of villages, I also show that disputes over irrigation water increase by 25 percent around the cutoff. Historical endowments of groundwater facilitate adoption of yield enhancing technologies over the long-run.

N2  - En agriculture, l'utilisation de techniques d'irrigation plus efficaces est souvent vue comme un moyen de protéger l'environnement en créant un impact positif sur la gestion de la ressource en eau. Utiliser des techniques efficaces doit ainsi permettre d'atteindre des rendements agricoles similaires à ceux obtenus initialement en utilisant un volume d'eau moins important (irrigation verte). Toutefois, un système d'irrigation plus efficace peut paradoxalement inciter les producteurs agricoles à utiliser plus d'eau. Cet effet, connu sous le nom d'effet rebond, est lié à l'augmentation de la productivité du facteur de production. L'objectif de cet article est d'identifier les facteurs qui garantissent l'efficacité de l'irrigation verte. Notre contribution porte sur le développement d'un modèle qui prend en compte l'évolution des charges énergétiques. Nos résultats suggèrent que des technologies d'irrigation plus efficaces peuvent conduire à une augmentation de la demande d'eau (effet rebond) et aussi de la demande d'énergie. L'effet rebond est, en partie, compensé par une augmentation des charges énergétiques, mais la consommation d'énergie peut contribuer à l'émission de gaz à effet de serre. Les décideurs publics doivent donc coordonner les objectifs de politiques environnementales en eau et en énergie, afin qu'ils soient atteints et non pas neutralisés.Classification JEL : Q15, Q25, Q55.
