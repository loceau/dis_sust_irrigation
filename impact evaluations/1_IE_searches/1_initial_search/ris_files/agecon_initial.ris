N2  - For fear of being accused of land grabbing, investors, the governments of host countries and international donors have sought to develop jointly capitalist farming and family farming by seeking synergies from “win-win” projects. The Irrigation Development Support Project (IDSP), established under the supervision of the Zambian government and financed by the World Bank, constitutes one of the prototypes of this new generation of projects. The aim of this article is to examine the conception and implementation of this project and to question its likely impact. By relying on the professional experience of one of the authors of this article on three of the sites of the project, on the critical reading of the project’s documents put at our disposal and, finally, on qualitative surveys carried out in 2017, 2018 and 2019, we highlight the contradictions inherent to the project, implementation difficulties and the foreseeable impact of the project on family farming, as well as in terms of national benefit.

N2  - The efficient and sustainable use of water is becoming standard practice in water scarce regions and pro-active policy initiatives are taken to increase supply reliability considering the local context. The aim of this paper is to evaluate farmers’ acceptance of policy strategies to increase water supply reliability in a water scarce river basin in the south east of Spain. Results from a choice experiment study suggest that farmers are willing to pay double water prices to ensure water supply reliability, through government supply guaranteed programs. However, they are averse to any other institutional changes that could assist the government to achieve increased water supply.

N2  - The main purpose of this paper is evaluating the competitiveness of the Alqueva 
irrigation project in the Alentejo region, South of Portugal. This study was based on three 
representative farms which were selected from one farm sample of the Monte Novo irrigation 
scheme. For each farm, it was developed a multi-period mathematical programming 
model which represents its specific skills. Results show that Common Agricultural Policy 
and Water Framework Directive have adverse impact on competitiveness. However, the adoption of new technological innovations and more environmental sustainable systems of agricultural production 
might help to mitigate those adverse impacts and promote the competitiveness of this irrigation project.

N2  - A tanulmány arra törekszik, hogy olyan átfogó elemzést bocsásson az olvasó rendelkezésére, amely az agrárgazdaság helyzetét tényszerűen, részletesen dokumentálva, az agrárökonómia szemüvegén keresztül értékeli. Célja megvilágítani az ágazatban kialakult helyzet okait, a várható tendenciákat, illetve felhívni a figyelmet a döntési pontokra. Magyarország agrárgazdasága az elmúlt két és fél évtizedben drasztikus pozícióvesztést szenvedett el a világ élelmiszer-termelésében, részesedése mintegy felére csökkent, jelenleg messze nem használja ki az ez irányú adottságait. Nemzetgazdasági szerepe, főbb makrogazdasági mutatói az európai mezőnybe illeszkednek. A GDP termelésben a mezőgazdaság aránya 3%, ugyanakkor az agrobiznisz szerkezeti problémáira utal és az élelmiszer-feldolgozás lemaradását jelzi, hogy az élelmiszeripar részesedése a bruttó hazai termékből mindössze 2%. Magyarországon a földpiac és a földbérleti piac elszakadt egymástól, különváltan működnek, eltérő, esetenként ellentétes hatásokat, információkat közvetítenek a termelők és a tulajdonosok felé. A tulajdoni szerkezetből és a földtulajdonosok státuszából adódóan a bérelt területek nagysága a nyugat-európainál jelentősebb, hiszen a teljes mezőgazdasági terület több mint felét teszik ki. Az elmúlt időszakban Magyarországon érezhetően csökkent a földkínálat és növekedett a földkereslet, ami – a területalapú támogatások által is ösztönözve – a földhaszonbérleti díjak emelkedésével járt együtt. Az öntözés fejlesztése stratégiai kérdés, mivel a jelenlegi öntözési helyzet nemzetközi összevetésben is tarthatatlan: az öntözött terület aránya Magyarországon mindössze 2%. Bár a foglalkoztatás mérése az egyik legbizonytalanabb eleme a statisztikának, különböző módszertan alapján készült adatközlések a 2010–2015-ös időszakra egyaránt a mezőgazdaság munkaerőigényének növekedését mutatják. Ez a folyamat azonban nem az ágazat teljesítménynövekedésének, a piaci alapú foglalkoztatás bővülésének a következménye, sokkal inkább ebbe az irányba hatott a lakosság közmunkaprogramokban történő részvétele. A nemzetközi tapasztalatok azt bizonyítják, hogy azoknak az országoknak a mezőgazdasága tudott az elmúlt évtizedekben megfelelni a világgazdasági kihívásoknak, ahol erős volt az agrárinnovációs tevékenység, magas volt a K+F aránya. Az innovációt befolyásolja a szaktanácsadás, a szakoktatás, a felsőoktatás és az agrárkutatás is, amelyek színvonalát és az erre szánt forrásokat emelni kell. Az elemzések adatai összességében azt bizonyították, hogy a mezőgazdaság a 2011–2014 közti időszak eredményei alapján a gazdasági kondíciót tekintve még napjainkban is „kegyelmi” helyzetben van, annak ellenére, hogy a jövedelemtermelését tekintve 2015-ben drasztikus volt a visszaesés. Ezt a kedvező állapotot a versenyképesség javulását eredményező fejlesztésekre kellene kihasználni. A több év átlagában relatíve magas árak és az uniós támogatások miatt még mindig erős – bár gyengülő – a gazdaságok pénzügyi helyzete, jelentősek a megtakarítások, kedvezőek a területalapú szubvenciók és ebben a támogatási ciklusban a Vidékfejlesztési Program jogcímei is lehetőséget jelentenek. Mindezek mellett alacsonyak a hitelkamatok, adottak tehát a feltételek egy intenzív beruházási ciklusra. A források azonban csak akkor mozdulnak meg, akkor generálnak beruházásokat, ha ehhez hosszú távra stabilnak remélt agrárpolitikai környezet kapcsolódik. = The study aims to create a detailed and objective analysis of Hungarian agriculture. It focuses on the reasons behind the present situation in the sector and suggests expected trends as well as drawing attention to decisions that need to be made. Hungary’s agriculture has suffered a drastic fall in its position in world food production in the last two and a half decades, its share falling by 50%. Hungary does not make use of its agricultural capabilities. Its role in the national economy, and main macroeconomic indicators fit into the European norm. The share of agricultural production in the gross domestic product (GDP) is 3%. However, the fact that the food industry’s share of the GDP is just 2%, indicates that there are structural problems within the agribusiness and that food processing has fallen behind. In Hungary, the land market and land rental market function separately, at times even conveying opposing effects to the producers and owners. Due to the ownership structure and the status of landowners, the size of the rented area is larger than in Western Europe, as it constitutes more than half of the total agricultural land in the country. In the recent period in Hungary there has been a marked reduction in land supply and increase in demand for land, and these changes have caused a rise in the land lease tariffs (that have also been encouraged by area-based subsidies). Irrigation development is a strategic issue, as the current situation is unsustainable. Only 2% of the land is irrigated, compared to 9% on average in the European Union, and 20% on average world-wide (with differences in climate). While the measuring of employment is one of the most uncertain elements in statistics, research based on different methodologies has indicated a growing demand for agricultural labour in the period between 2010 and 2015. However, this process is not due to the growth in the production of the industry or the growth in market-based employment, but much rather on the “public work” programme. International experience shows that the countries that were actively engaged in agricultural innovation and had a high level of research and development were the same countries that were able to live up to the world economic challenges of the past decades. Innovation is influenced by the use of consultants, training, higher education and agricultural research, the levels of which along with the allocated funds need to be raised. The research data show that the last 3-4 years have been exceptionally fortunate for agriculture, and the good economic climate should be used to aid development that will boost Hungary’s competitiveness. Relatively high prices and EU support have strengthened the financial position of farms, there are significant savings, the area-based subsidies are favourable in rural development. Moreover, lending rates are low. Thus the requirements needed for an intensive investment cycle are there. The sources, however, can only be mobilised if these can be linked to the promise of long-term stability of agricultural policy.

N2  - Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth. Its most important irrigation development is in the Murray-Darling Basin, which is relatively adjacent to the majority of Australia’s population. CGE modelling using TERM-H2O has demonstrated that attempts to restore the balance between water for economic purposes and water for the environment in the basin will have little impact on regional economies. However, substantial public spending has been on inefficient water infrastructure upgrades to appease concerns about regional economic damage. Modelling of the Flinders-Gilbert irrigation scheme proposed in far northern Queensland indicates that it is unlikely to yield net economic benefits. Although in theory there is abundant water that irrigators could use, extreme isolation is among the reasons that the scheme is unlikely to be viable. The Ord River scheme, completed in tropical Western Australia in the early 1970s, has created few jobs relative to construction costs. Research is currently under way on variants of the “Bradfield” scheme. Projects under this scheme aim to use water in remote Queensland for economic purposes.

N2  - With adverse impacts of climate change growing in number and intensity, there is an urgent need to reduce emissions from food systems to net zero. This can only be achieved if rural areas in low- and middle-income countries gain access to clean energy. A review of the research and capacity building contributions of the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) over the last 10 years suggests important contributions in the areas of energy policy and energy investment planning, cost and feasibility frameworks, and business models for clean energy technology uptake. WLE has also conducted successful pilot projects on solar irrigation to provide an evidence base for scaling up innovative energy initiatives. Finally, the program also considered non-agricultural uses of energy where relevant to food systems, and implemented capacity building activities. Going forward, CGIAR has a key role to play in providing information, supporting access and piloting innovative, scalable clean energy interventions to support the achievement of multiple impacts for the poorest and most food-insecure women and men farmers and entrepreneurs.

N1  - Presented at the 19th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Washington DC, USA
N2  - Human activities are increasingly leading to overuse of surface water and nonrenewable groundwater, challenging the capacity of water resources to ensure food security and continuous growth of the economy. Adaptation policies targeting specifically water security can easily overlook its interaction with other sustainability metrics and unanticipated local responses to the larger-scale policy interventions. Using a recently developed global partial equilibrium, grid-resolving model, nick-named SIMPLE-on-a-Grid and coupling it with the global Water Balance Model, we simulate the impacts of reducing unsustainable irrigation water withdrawals on land use change and food supply, under a variety of future (2050) scenarios with and without adaptations. Comparisons are made among three policy interventions: inter-basin water transfers, investments in agricultural productivity-enhancing technologies, and the promotion of virtual water trade. Although each of these scenarios affects regional food supply in a similar fashion, their implications for land cover change, carbon emissions and global food security are quite different. By allowing for a systematic comparison of these alternative adaptations to future scarcity, the global gridded modeling approach offers unique insights into the multiscale nature of the water scarcity challenge.

N2  - Agricultural development is essential for improved well-being in rural Ecuador. As much as 40% of the population relies on agriculture as its primary source of income and agricultural exports account for a significant proportion of foreign exchange revenue. In the highlands, potatoes are a major staple, and more than 90,000 producers grow them on about 60,000 hectares of land. Potato production is associated with heavy use of chemical inputs--pesticides and fertilizers--to manage pests and optimize profits. Concerns have emerged about the sustainability of Ecuador's potato crop as rising input costs have created a cost squeeze and public health officials are increasingly concerned about health consequences of pesticide over use. Producers need alternative pest management approaches that are feasible, economically sustainable, and effective at controlling pests. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach that can help lower production costs, reduce exposure to pesticides, and improve long-term sustainability of the agricultural system. The national agricultural research institution in Ecuador (INIAP), supported in part by the IPM Collaborative Research Support Project (IPM CRSP) funded by USAID has developed technologies to manage potato pests. Information regarding these technologies reaches farmers through several diffusion mechanisms, including farmer field schools (FFS), field days, exposure to other farmers, and written media (e.g. pamphlets). Given only limited involvement of the public sector in technology transfer, decision makers need to understand the relative cost effectiveness of alternative dissemination methods. This understanding can help promote better technology transfer and, in so doing, effectively create a more sustainable potato production sector in Ecuador.

This study had several objectives: 1) to analyze the extent of IPM use in Carchi and identify the determinants and constraints to IPM adoption, 2) to evaluate how IPM technologies are spread among potato farmers in Carchi, Ecuador, and 3) to compare the cost-effectiveness of the FFSs to other information dissemination methods. Carchi is of interest because it is Ecuador's primary potato production region, its potato producers suffer damage from the three major potato pests, and because it shares a border with Colombia. There is interest in generating stable agriculture-base livelihoods in the region. 

The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to achieve the above objectives. A comprehensive survey was conducted of 109 potato farmers in Carchi. Respondents included 30 Farmer Field School (FFS) participants, 28 farmers who had been exposed to FFS-participants, and 51 randomly selected farmers. Farmers were asked a series of questions including the following information categories: demographic and socioeconomic, potato production, pesticide usage and handling, IPM knowledge and implemented techniques, and knowledge about the three most significant potato pests. These pests are, in order of economic significance, Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans), the Andean Potato Weevil (Premnotrypes vorax), and the Central American Tuber Moth (Tecia solanivora). The quantitative information was combined with qualitative interviews, information on budgets and costs from the FFSs, and expert opinion.

The analysis involved three steps: (i) determination of spread of information and sources of information by adoption level; (ii) analysis of the determinants of adoption using an ordered probit model; and (iii) use of the econometric results together with information on program costs to examine cost effectiveness. Step (i) involved use of descriptive statistics and differences in means. Each farmer was given a score for his or her level of IPM usage: 1=no usage, 2=minimal adoption, 3=moderate adoption, 4=high adoption, and 5=full adoption. The IPM index value is used to analyze the relationship between access to information, IPM knowledge and adoption. It is also used as the dependent variable in the econometric model. 

In the ordered probit model, independent variables included three categories of potential determinants of adoption for IPM potato technologies including: (i) farmer characteristics, (ii) economic factors, and (iii) institutional factors. Technology characteristics (complexity and labor requirements) and farmer perceptions (perceived profitability, risk, and preferences) are considered, not as separate variables in the model, but qualitatively to provide feedback in conjunction with model results. Specific variables included in the econometric model were: farmer age, education, household size, household members over the age of 14 (indication of labor availability), land holdings, illness from pesticides, and five variables representing the sources of information for acquiring knowledge about IPM. The five information sources included: (i) attended FFS, (ii) exposed to FFS-participant farmers, (iii) exposed to non-FFS farmers, (iv) attended one or more field days, and (v) exposed to written materials (pamphlets). 

Model results showed that farmer characteristics (socio-economic factors) did not play a significant role in affecting adoption rates. Four of five information sources had a positive impact on adoption. FFS-participation was the main determinant of adoption, followed by field days, pamphlets, and exposure to FFS-participants. Apart from information effects, the only other significant variable in the model was household size where larger households adopted less IPM. Lack of effects from household variables may be due to limitations in the survey sample. On the other hand, farmer characteristics affected participation in FFS, which, in turn, was a major determinant of IPM adoption.

The variable land holdings was included in the model to evaluate whether there was a relationship between household wealth and adoption. Although it was not significant in the probit regression, there is evidence that capital or income may be a constraint for adopters. When we examined technology attributes of specific IPM activities and the patterns of adoption, we found that activities perceived as risky and/or were capital-intensive were adopted least in all farmer groups. These activities included buying high-quality seed, use of resistant varieties, irrigation, use of recommended storage, and use of fungicides with different active ingredients. In addition, most farmers claimed that an increase in pesticide prices or potato prices would cause them to use more IPM. 

Marginal effects from the ordered probit model and cost data were used to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of information dissemination mechanisms. In terms of quality of information, FFS participants have the most thorough understanding of IPM and the highest adoption rates. Concerning pesticide safety, FFSs have had the most effect on farmers in terms of safe pesticide handling. Factoring in costs, field days and pamphlets are possibly more cost-effective as diffusion mechanisms. Although these farmers have slightly lower knowledge scores and adoption rates, the benefits are high relative to the costs of implementation. FFS cost 20 times as much as a field days and 60 times as much as a pamphlet. They provide valuable information but only a small percentage of farmers can attend the limited number of schools. Through exposure to FFS participants, other farmers choose to learn about IPM through field days and pamphlets. By combining these information diffusion mechanisms (FFS, field days, farmer interactions and pamphlets), large populations of farmers are able to access important IPM messages. Based on our survey results, we expect that access to information will lead to higher rates of adoption. 

The study found evidence of farmer-to-farmer diffusion from FFS to non-FFS farmers, but further analysis is necessary to evaluate the nature and quality of information transfers. Analysis is also needed to identify communities that have not been exposed to IPM and evaluate the best approach for those areas.

N2  - Hunger and starvation in sub-Saharan Africa have lasted too long. But Africans are not consigned to a lifetime of food insecurity. The knowledge, technology and resources for closing the food security deficit are available today, and breakthroughs will continue to emerge from research and development. But no one believes it is possible simply to distribute better seeds and more fertilizer to African farmers and then to walk away. Nor will economic growth alone solve the problem. The failures that add up to food insecurity are pervasive, from agricultural, health, education and nutrition policies to research, extension services, sanitation, local government, commerce and transport. An effective response to a challenge this broad cannot be narrowed to a single intervention, discipline or institutional mandate. It will take a coordinated response across sectors. This Africa Human Development Report, the first, argues that sustainable increases in agricultural productivity protect food entitlements— the ability of people to access food. Furthering human development requires nutrition policies that unleash the potential of today’s and future generations. Also, communities must be resilient enough to absorb shocks and have the power to make decisions about their own lives. Food security for human development For too long the face of sub-Saharan Africa has been one of dehumanizing hunger. More than one in four Africans is undernourished, and food insecurity— the inability to consistently acquire enough calories and nutrients for a healthy and productive life— is pervasive. The spectre of famine, which has virtually disappeared elsewhere in the world, continues to haunt parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Famines grab headlines, but chronic food insecurity and malnutrition are more insidious, often silent, daily calamities for millions of Africans. Yet sub-Saharan Africa has ample agricultural land, plenty of water and a generally favourable climate for growing food. And in the last 10 years many African countries posted world-beating economic growth rates and became among the fastest movers on the Human Development Index. With these endowments and important economic and social achievements, why is the region still food insecure? These two jarring paradoxes are the point of departure for this Report. The Report argues that sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and better nutrition are the drivers of food-secure growth and human development. The argument is straightforward: more productive agriculture will build food security by increasing food availability and lowering food prices, thus improving access. Higher productivity can also raise the incomes of millions of smallholder farmers, elevating living standards and improving health and education, thus expanding people’s capabilities. Through science, technology and the diffusion of innovation greater agricultural productivity can also enable better stewardship of the environment. Sound nutrition links food security to human development. Well-nourished people exercise their freedoms and capabilities in different domains— the essence of human development— and, completing the cycle, will be inclined to demand food security from their leaders. The human development approach focuses on entitlements and capabilities. Food security should thus be leveraged by empowering people to make their own choices and by building resilience in the face of shocks. That means preserving people’s food entitlements— the income, market structures, institutional rules and governance that enable the poor to buy and trade food in fair markets. It also means reinforcing essential human capabilities in health and education. Focusing policies on these four areas— agricultural productivity, nutrition, resilience and empowerment— can unleash a dynamic virtuous cycle of food security and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa still trails the world in human development, but the quickening pace of change and the new economic vitality in the region offer grounds for renewed (if guarded) optimism. Conditions in sub-Saharan Africa today Sub-Saharan Africa has abundant agricultural resources. But shamefully, in all corners of the region, millions of people remain hungry and malnourished— the result of glaringly uneven local food production and distribution and chronically deficient diets, especially among the poorest. This is a daily violation of people’s dignity, with many governments not fulfilling their basic responsibility of protecting their citizens from hunger. The chain of food security that runs from availability through access to use comes under constant stress in a region vulnerable to the impacts of erratic weather, volatile food prices, and conflict and violence. Agricultural productivity remains low— much lower than in other regions. Many sub-Saharan African countries are net food importers and even depend on food aid during all-too-frequent humanitarian crises. Where food is available, millions cannot afford it or are prevented from buying or trading it by underdeveloped markets, poor roads, long distances to markets and high transport costs. Important as food availability and access are, food security is about still more. Proper use of food and good nutrition determine whether food security sustains human development. Malnutrition leads to illness and death— as insufficient access to safe water, energy and sanitation combine with diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria in a lethal mix that perpetuates the problem. Hunger exacts a crippling toll on individuals and society alike. Poorly nourished children have weakened immune systems and die from communicable diseases that are ordinarily curable. Malnourishment in the first 1,000 days after conception can lead to irreparable damage to children’s physical and mental development. Malnourished mothers are at greater risk of dying during childbirth or of delivering lowbirthweight babies who do not survive infancy. Infants that make it through childhood are more likely to suffer stunting that shortens their lives and to perpetuate the cycle of deprivation when those children in turn produce low-birthweight babies. Africans have been trapped by hunger for decades, with millions consuming staple foods deficient in the micronutrients needed to sustain child growth and adult productivity. Hunger also eviscerates society by increasing disease, mortality and disability. It inflates healthcare costs, reduces worker productivity and diminishes social and economic returns to education. It violates basic human dignity and damages self-esteem. Persistent challenges and emerging threats Misguided policies, weak institutions and failing markets are the deeper causes of sub-Saharan Africa’s food insecurity. This tainted inheritance is most evident in households and communities, where unequal power relations trap vulnerable groups— subsistence farmers, the landless poor, many women and children— in a vicious cycle of deprivation, food insecurity and low human development. For decades the policies of national governments and international institutions neglected sub-Saharan Africa’s rural and agricultural development in favour of urban populations. Their damaging legacies include ineffective postcolonial industrialization plans that exhausted development resources, leaving agriculture behind. Structural adjustment programmes aimed to close budget gaps but instead created large human development deficits, especially among the vulnerable poor, and skewed allocations of national revenue and foreign aid that overlooked agriculture and nutrition. Despite some improvements since the mid- 1990s, many African governments continue to burden domestic agriculture with high, arbitrary taxes while bestowing subsidies, incentives and macroeconomic support on other sectors. Meanwhile, many developed countries have moved the other way, heavily subsidizing agriculture long after its role as a development driver has passed, giving their farmers a tremendous advantage in international trade. Sub-Saharan Africa’s smallholder farmers, sidelined by biased policies and squeezed by failing markets, long ago gave up struggling to compete against the world’s most formidable agricultural systems. Breaking with the past, standing up to the vested interests of the privileged few and building institutions that rebalance power relations at all levels of society will require courageous citizens and dedicated leaders. Taking these steps is all the more pressing as new threats to the sustainability of sub-Saharan Africa’s food systems have emerged. Demographic change, environmental pressure, and global and local climate change are profoundly reconfiguring the region’s development options. These new challenges will be magnified by sub-Saharan Africa’s rising population, almost 2 billion by 2050. Meeting the increasing demand for food will require substantially boosting food crop yields over the next half century and mitigating stresses put on agricultural production by climate change and current agricultural practices. Only sharp and sustainable increases in agricultural productivity will enable food production, incomes and livelihoods to keep pace with these developments. Raising agricultural productivity Local agricultural capacity is the bedrock of food security in sub-Saharan Africa, a truth so apparent it would hardly require stating had it not been so consistently slighted. Agriculture determines the availability of food, the first link in the chain of food security. For most Africans, especially the poor, agriculture is also the wellspring of income and work, core elements of human development. In turn, earnings and employment bolster food security by enabling access to sufficient quantities of nutritious food. Beyond these crucial and mutually reinforcing effects, agriculture also shapes how— and how sustainably— the region uses much of its land and water. Despite agriculture’s importance, it has performed below its potential for generations in sub-Saharan Africa, neglected by government policies and held back by low farm productivity. Following age-old practices, African smallholder farmers have long survived by growing crops on reclaimed forest and grazing land or by recycling plots without replenishing their nutrients. Production increases have come from expanding cultivated land area, not from making farming more efficient. The scope for further area expansion is diminishing, and farmers now need to produce more food for each unit of land, with the help of modern technology. Productivity increases will generate farm employment; decent wages, including those for unskilled labour; and income for rural communities. Boosting productivity requires more fertilizers and seeds, stronger research and development, and a more coordinated and responsive extension system staffed by experts versed in the behaviours and habitats of local farming communities. “Smart subsidies,” which encourage smallholder farmers to shift to high-yield crop varieties without saddling the state with long-term costs, can energize food production and markets. Research that embraces local farmers’ knowledge as part of the technology for improving yields can deliver results where blinkered laboratory designs have failed. Encouraging smallholder farmers to adopt new inputs begins with understanding their resistance to change. Policy-making and institutional research should focus on varietal options for health and nutrition. Multidisciplinary knowledge is required to develop environmentally sustainable farm technologies. Modern agricultural technology can deliver solutions that not only boost yields but also economize on inputs, making fertilizer and water use more environment friendly. Creating and diffusing science and innovation require more collaboration among breeders, researchers and farmers. Irrigation presents a long-term challenge for sub-Saharan Africa. Most countries have to make large investments in irrigation methods designed for sustainable and employment-intensive water management. But not all parts of the region need irrigation. Many semihumid and humid zones have enough moisture to make other means of water control feasible. Better market access can also boost yields. When farmers can transport their surpluses quickly and cheaply to points of sale or storage, they have incentives to increase production. This will take market development policies, transport regulation reforms to introduce competition, and substantial investment in rural roads, information technology, railways and warehouses. Access to credit and insurance through innovative schemes can lower the risks of adopting new inputs and motivate farmers to experiment with new varieties. Attracting young Africans to participate in agriculture will bring new energy and ideas into its development. Technology and innovation can create enticing and profitable openings, enterprises and occupations along the value chain of a sector that young people have come to denigrate as a backwater. Connecting three assets— a bulging youth population, advances in innovation and the promise of agricultural development— is a natural way forward for many countries. Higher agricultural productivity can deliver a triple dividend— sustained food security, higher human development and lower pressure on land and water. But governments will have to rethink their priorities in order to pay for the required investments. Self-defeating policies that put guns before bread, cities before farms and fatty foods before nutrition will not measure up. Adequate funding for agricultural research and development and for effective regional collaboration on big-ticket investments in land and water control will yield a richer harvest for sub-Saharan Africa than will sowing conflicts with bullets or converting continental breadbaskets into fuel tanks. From food security to human development through nutrition Too often the news from sub-Saharan Africa is easy to predict: famine and humanitarian food crises on the front page, volatile international food prices in the business section and numbing images of emaciated children in the magazine supplement. But while hunger dominates the African narrative, malnutrition— its silent accomplice— seldom makes headlines. Malnutrition is an obstacle to human development, inflicting irreversible damage on individuals early in life and imposing large economic and social losses on countries for years to come. Malnutrition is a plague on childhood. It can span generations in the form of hidden hunger, a lifesapping inheritance of nutrient deficiency resulting from past practices of eating low-quality foods. But fortifying these staples can preserve their place in traditional diets. Improving micronutrient intake is among the most effective— and cost-effective— ways to combat malnutrition. Concentrating on a handful of nutrients (vitamin A, iodine, iron and zinc) can leverage large human development returns from a small input— one of society’s most efficient development investments. Many of the most critical and cost-effective nutrition interventions are not expensive. One is empowering women, a far-reaching way to help households break the cycle of intergenerational deprivation. When women have less say in decisions than men do, nutrition suffers, household food security deteriorates and access to healthcare lags. When women have more influence on household choices, child nutrition often prospers. Well-nourished people are more productive and more receptive to learning. Well-nourished children learn better and are more likely to live lives they value. Indeed, the importance of nutrition begins even before children are born: nutrition during gestation has long-term benefits for children’s ability to learn and grow. Food science is uncovering new ways to improve the diets of the poor. Research on biofortification— breeding nutrients into crops— holds great promise because it focuses on the unprocessed food staples that poor people eat in large quantities every day. Biofortification implicitly targets its nutrient enrichment to low-income households that do not consume commercially fortified processed foods. While the technology has limits, it could give traditional African diets a major nutrition boost. Nutrition is affected by a range of circumstances— from the political economy and seasonal and climate conditions to cultural and religious customs, the availability of health services and the level of household education, including knowledge of sound eating and health practices. Also in play are agricultural production and income, access to varied and nutritious foods, a sanitary environment and sufficient safe water and cooking fuel. A multidimensional challenge of this order demands a multisectoral nutrition strategy— one with high-level government commitment, adequate resources and nutrition-sensitive interventions by the state, civil society, the private sector and the international community. Nutrition has to move up the policy agenda and down to households. Otherwise, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to incur the high costs to its citizens and societies of one of the region’s most disabling deficits. Building resilience From field to table the supply of food in sub-Saharan Africa is fraught with risk. Shocks, cycles and trends threaten food security and livelihoods. Conflict, droughts, floods, food price spikes and other shocks inflict immediate hardship on the poorest and most vulnerable households and constrain future human development. And too often the damage is permanent. Cyclical or longer term stresses— such as seasonal harvesting patterns that result in long “hungry seasons” between harvests, or creeping environmental degradation— are slower moving and more predictable. But they devastate communities all the same— especially those that cannot manage their exposure to hazards and protect their livelihoods. Stresses from population pressure are pervasive and growing. Preventing or relieving stresses before they undermine food systems requires action across multiple fronts— from the environment to conflict resolution, market stability and women’s empowerment. Long-term thinking requires lowering agriculture’s contribution to climate change through policies that emphasize climate-smart practices. Ensuring that techniques to boost agricultural productivity are sustainable will allow farmers to adapt to climate change and to reap the benefits of nutrient-enriched soils today without adding to environmental stress. Action to curb conflicts in the region would reduce the frequency of food system collapses. Dampening the volatility of global food prices is a collective endeavour for the international community. But African countries have a large stake in backing a new global architecture for agriculture and food security based on better market access for food importers, fewer restrictions on exporters and less distortion in biofuel markets. Effective responses to rising demographic pressures on the food supply start with enlarging women’s capabilities by improving their access to education, earnings and effective family planning services. Forward-looking measures can buffer food systems from stress— or at least reduce the frequency and intensity of the most damaging strains. But crises happen, and poor communities must be ready to manage risks and cope with shocks. Social protection— such as insurance, employment protection, food and cash-for-work programmes, food assistance, subsidies and social transfers— can determine whether crisis-struck households survive or succumb. However, avoiding deterioration in food systems and mitigating the impacts of breakdowns are hardly progress. The most effective social protection policies raise returns to core productive assets— in sub-Saharan Africa, labour and land— and lift people out of poverty, reducing their need for social support and building their capacity to withstand recurring shocks. Linking social protection to measures that enhance farmers’ access to technology, stabilize rural markets and commodity prices, and build up rural infrastructure can make farmers, households and markets more resilient. Empowerment, social justice and gender This Report shows that the basic right to food— and the right to life itself— is being violated in sub-Saharan Africa to an intolerable degree. Building a food secure continent requires transformative change— change that will be most effective if accompanied by a shift of resources, capacities and decisions to smallholder farmers, poor communities and women. When women and other vulnerable groups gain a voice in the decisions affecting their lives and livelihoods, their capacity to produce, trade and use food is materially enhanced. Knowledge and organization are the keys to opening the public space. Information technology can put up-to-the-minute knowledge about market prices and conditions at farmers’ fingertips, increasing their leverage, while cooperatives and producer associations can provide platforms for collective bargaining. When food market actors— farmers, transporters, sellers and buyers— communicate regularly and quickly, costs and transaction times fall and farmers’ incomes tend to rise. High connectivity can make farmers better traders and markets more transparent. New inputs and farming techniques can liberate farmers from cycles of low productivity and poverty. But technology is double-edged. Misapplied, it dispossesses or marginalizes smallholder farmers. Science conducted far from where its results are used, and compartmentalized in water-tight disciplines, can lead to designs poorly suited to smallholder farms and local habitats. Participation and voice grow stronger when political, economic and social power is widely dispersed. Locally determined solutions are usually more sustainable than top-down decisions. Producer organizations amplify the political voice of farmers, reduce the costs of marketing inputs and outputs and provide a meeting point for collective approaches. Community-based targeting can prevent elites from capturing social transfers, drawing on local knowledge to identify people most eligible for social protection. African farmers have found vocal allies in autonomous civil society organizations, which can mobilize public interest around issues, monitor the performance of governments and lobby them to act in line with basic human rights. In addition to rights-based organizations, a range of development-based civil society organizations focused on charity, recovery and relief undertake food security interventions. But African civil society is still evolving, so its role in delivering food security can be neither discounted nor relied on completely. Accountability is the necessary counterpart to voice. When accountable authorities answer to engaged communities, social justice is served. In the short run community organization and civic engagement will have to fill many gaps. Communitybased social audits to monitor delivery of social protection programmes and other public services— and rights-based (rather than discretionary) approaches that elevate interventions to the status of citizens’ rights—can strengthen the social contract between people and their government. Control over land is crucial for smallholder farmers. In sub-Saharan Africa family holdings pass from one generation to the next with ill-defined rights of tenure, leaving smallholder farmers vulnerable to dispossession and exploitation. A new development that risks aggravating these insecurities is the recent international scramble for land in sub-Saharan Africa. One danger is that largescale investments may displace people without consultation or adequate compensation. In countries where many people work in agriculture, separating them from their land without first creating opportunities in nonfarm sectors is likely to increase poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. There are strong and mutually reinforcing links between expanding women’s capabilities— through better education, more direct control over resources and a more decisive voice in decision-making— and enhancing food security. Empowering women, who make up almost half the agricultural labour force in sub-Saharan Africa, is a highly efficient way to achieve progress across the multiple dimensions of food security. But even beyond such instrumental qualities and possible gains in efficiency, women’s empowerment must remain a central policy priority because equality and nondiscrimination are of intrinsic value. As human rights, women’s rights deserve to be promoted for that reason alone. Yet women in sub-Saharan Africa have less control than men do over productive resources such as assets, land and credit; their time is often devoted to activities that are nonmarketed and undervalued; and their access to key institutions such as courts and markets is curtailed. Famines and food crises continue to plague the region as nowhere else. The cycles of hunger and despair with which so many Africans struggle and “cope,” and which too often trap them, show no signs of letting go. Responsibility for these appalling conditions is shared among governments, institutions and markets in the region and abroad. The challenge of food security in sub-Saharan Africa is formidable, the timeframe for action is tight and the investment required is substantial. But the potential gains for human development are immense.

N2  - High population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita and a process of agricultural intensification in South Asia. While this process has significantly increased food production to feed the growing population, it has also entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. This paper employs the analytical tools of economic theory, environmental and ecological economics to model the impact of irrigation in South Asia. It underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to environmentalizing agricultural development.

N2  - Since the early 1990s, India has undergone substantial economic policy reform
and economic growth. Though reforms in agricultural policy have lagged those in other
sectors, they have nonetheless created a somewhat more open economic orientation. In
this study, we evaluate the protection and support versus disprotection of agriculture in
India. Our methodology involves examining market price support (MPS) for eleven
crops, the expenditures on input subsidies benefiting farmers (for fertilizer, electricity and
irrigation), and product-specific and total producer support estimates (PSEs) over the
period 1985-2002. We draw on the extensive price-comparison and subsidy-measurement
data sets and analysis developed earlier by Gulati and his co-authors, often using
disaggregated analysis for representative surplus and deficit states. This allows us to
explore how key cost adjustments impact the results.
Overall, our results indicate that support for agriculture in India has been countercyclical.
Support for agriculture has been rising when world prices are low (as in the mid
1980s and 1998-2002) and falling when world prices are high (as in the early and mid
1990s). Our results demonstrate the increased importance of budgetary payments for
input subsidies in agriculture in recent years. Yet, in the aggregate for both price support
and budgetary expenditures over the period 1985-2002 the counter-cyclical dimension of
agricultural policy dominates a clear trend of movement from disprotection towards
protection.
Using different variants of MPS and PSE measurment we have extended earlier
analysis to demonstrate the impact of key assumptions on the calculations. These
assumptions we argue are important to consider. For example, in the standard approach,
the MPS for the covered commodities is “scaled up” based on the share of the covered
commodities in the total value of production. If the commodity coverage is less than
complete, as is often the case, the scaling up procedure leads to a total MPS of greater
absolute value than the MPS for the covered commodities. This can result in PSEs of
different sign than the non-scaled up version but is inappropriate unless market price
support for the commodities not covered is similar to that of the covered commodities. Furthermore, we find that the standard procedure of computing the MPS through
a comparison of the domestic price to an adjusted reference price based on observed
imports or exports can be problematic. This happens when trade volumes are relatively
small. In such a scenario a reference price based on observed imports or exports can lead
to misleading conclusions. To address the reference price issue, we follow Byerlee and
Morris (1993). Essentially the approach adopted is to compute the level of protection or
disprotection based on a counterfactual reference price chosen on economic criteria i.e.
the adjusted reference price that would exist in the country if the policy interventions
were removed. The relevant price can either be the autarky equilibrium price or the
import or export adjusted reference price depending on the relationship among these
prices. We apply this modified procedure for six crops (wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, sugar
and groundnuts). The choice of the crops is dictated by the fact that India has been near
self-sufficiency and there have been changes in the direction of trade over the period of
analysis.
The magnitudes of estimated support for agriculture obtained in this paper are
important for several reasons. The estimates confirm that high levels of subsidies were
required for India to export wheat or rice in recent years, a conclusion reached by several
other studies. However, we report less disprotection of Indian agriculture in the 1990s
than in earlier studies. Partly this difference is explained by the modified procedure for
choice of a reference price. A large component of this difference can be accounted for by
whether or not the scaling up procedure is invoked.
There are also fertile areas for future research. Estimates of adjustment costs used
in domestic-to-border price comparisons, such as transportation and processing costs or
marketing margins, are crucial variables in the analysis and merit being re-examined and
further updated. Resolving what are the most reasonable assumptions about reference
prices, or extending the analysis to additional crops and livestock to reduce uncertainty in
future assessments will also contribute to fuller understanding of the net stance of policy
toward agriculture and how it has evolved over time.

N2  - General circulation models predict significant and accelerating changes in local patterns of precipitation and temperature over the next century. The vulnerability of agriculture to climate change will depend on both the biophysical impacts of climate change on crop yields and on the agricultural system’s ability to adapt to changing production conditions. Shifts in the extent and distribution of irrigated and dryland production are a potentially important adaptation response. Farmer flexibility to adapt may be limited, however, by changing availability of irrigation water under future climate conditions. This study uses a suite of models to explore the biophysical and economic impacts of climate change on U.S. fieldcrop production under several potential future climate projections, and the potential limits and opportunities for adaptation arising from shifting regional water balances. Study findings suggest that the impacts of irrigation shortage on cropland use vary by region but that the net impacts on national production of surface-water irrigation shortages attributable to climate change are small relative to the direct biophysical impacts of climate change on yield.

N2  - This paper uses an advanced Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model coupled with biophysical data on future changes in crop yields due to climate change to examine: 1) the consequences of climate change for India’s agricultural and food products; 2) the extent to which water scarcity can affect the irrigation adoption and demand for water; and 3) how water scarcity, climate change, and trade jointly alter land use changes across the Indian subcontinent. It shows that when water scarcity is ignored, irrigated areas grows due to changes in crop yields induced by climate change. When water scarcity is introduced, competition for water increases and that largely reduces demand for irrigation across all river basins in India. When available water for irrigation is not limited, climate change alone could moderately increase agricultural outputs at national level and that leads to some welfare gains. However, water scarcity, induced by expansion in water demand in non-agricultural uses and lack of water infrastructure, blocks the demand for irrigation and that generates significant negative impacts on the economy of India and its agricultural activates. The overall welfare losses due to water scarcity for this economy is expected to be about $3.2 billion (at 2007 prices) in 2030. With a 3% discount rate, the net present value of the annual reductions in welfare will be about $24.3 billion for 2008 to 2030.

N2  - Agricultural water plays a significant role in terms of enhancing food self-sufficiency and food security. The supply of agricultural water based on the irrigation facilities contributes to improving agricultural productivity. The objective of this study is to explore both farmers’ and non-farmers’ perceptions and satisfactions about a government policy of improving irrigation facilities. Also, the paper investigates factors affecting their satisfaction about the government maintenance and management project of irrigation facilities. The results demonstrate that farmers, who insist the necessity of renovation of a reservoir located where they live in, are apt to be relatively dissatisfied with the government project. The magnitudes of marginal effects indicate that farmers’ satisfaction living in an agricultural area is higher than that of non-farmers. Finally, it is shown that farmers with higher satisfaction toward a government undertaking of improving a reservoir tend to be satisfied with a government project of repairing an irrigation and drainage canal as well.

N2  - Recently, there has been very little irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa. The main reasons cited for this lack of interest in developing irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa is that irrigation projects are expensive and perform poorly compared to projects from other regions. However, when classified into success and failure projects, the sub-Saharan Africa success projects’ investment costs are not significantly higher than from other regions. African countries like Ethiopia, which has embarked on an agricultural led development program, aspire to use irrigation as a development strategy with small scale irrigation playing a key role in rural development. This study evaluates the financial performance of small scale irrigation using O &amp; M and investment recovery, and the ability to replicate the investments. It is concluded that the systems are financially viable and provide a low cost development option for rural areas.

N2  - This paper examines the anti-poverty impacts of irrigation and markets on the welfare of rural households within the PRISM framework. Specifically, the papers addresses: the magnitude of anti-poverty effects of irrigation and conditions strengthening the poverty-reducing impact of it; and the market constraints of fruit and vegetable producers. The relationship between irrigation, market-orientation of smallholders and poverty is examined using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis. In the descriptive analysis, low prices for vegetable and fruit, weak demand, lack of price information, and inadequate transportation have been identified as the main limiting factor for output market. The beneficial effect of irrigation, literacy rate of household heads, and extra years of schooling is readily apparent from the regression. A simulation approach is also used to explore the impact of irrigation and other factors, individually and together, on poverty. The results show that although irrigation reduces poverty, the effect is greater when combined with improving the literacy level of households. This evidence calls for policy measures that focus on the concurrent interventions in irrigation, education, markets, and other supporting inputs, thereby reducing poverty in the cash growing rural areas.

N2  - India's semi-arid tropical (SAT) region is characterized by seasonally concentrated rainfall, low agricultural productivity, degraded natural resources, and substantial human poverty. The green revolution that transformed agriculture elsewhere in India had little impact on rainfed agriculture in the SAT. In the 1980s and 1990s, agricultural scientists and planners aimed to promote rainfed agricultural development through watershed development. A watershed is an area from which all water drains to a common point, making it an attractive unit for technical efforts to manage water and soil resources for production and conservation. 

Watershed projects are complicated, however, by the fact that watershed boundaries rarely correspond to human-defined boundaries. Also, watershed projects often distribute costs and benefits unevenly, with costs incurred disproportionately upstream, typically among poorer residents, and benefits realized disproportionately downstream, where irrigation is concentrated and the wealthiest farmers own most of the land. 

Watershed projects take a wide variety of strategies, ranging from those that are more technocratic to those that pay more attention to the social organization of watersheds. By the mid-1990s annual expenditure on watershed development in India approached $500 million, but there was relatively little information available on the success of different project approaches. 

This study addresses three main research questions: 1) What projects are most successful in promoting the objectives of raising agricultural productivity, improving natural resource management and reducing poverty? 2) What approaches enable them to succeed? 3) What nonproject factors also contribute to achieving these objectives? The major hypotheses are that participatory approaches that devote more attention to social organization yield superior project impact, and that favorable economic conditions and good infrastructure also support better natural resource management and higher productivity. 

A detailed survey of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh states covered 86 villages under several watershed projects as well as nonproject villages with no project. The projects covered operated under the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Rural Development, various nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and in collaboration between NGOs and the Government of Maharashtra. The government projects were more technocratic in focus, whereas the NGO projects focused more on social organization, and the government-nongovernment collaborative projects tried to draw on the strengths of both approaches. 

The analysis of the Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh villages compared pre- and post-project conditions in the study villages. Quantitative analysis at the village level addressed performance indicators such as changes in access to water for irrigation and drinking, change in employment opportunities, soil erosion and conservation on uncultivated lands and drainage lines, and change in availability of various products from the common (government revenue) lands. At the plot level, performance indicators included changes in cropping intensity, change in yields, soil erosion on cultivated lands, farmers' land improvement investments, and annual net returns to cultivation. This analysis was supplemented by qualitative information about the effects of the projects on different interest groups in the villages such as farmers with irrigation, farmers without irrigation, landless people, shepherds, and women. 

Findings of the empirical study in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh lend support to the hypothesis that more participatory projects perform better than their more technocratic, top-down counterparts, and that a combination of participation and sound technical input may perform the best of all. Evidence about the role of economic conditions and infrastructure is more limited. 

Despite rhetoric to the contrary, successful participatory projects remain few in number so their impact is limited. In the study area in rainfed areas of Maharashtra's Pune and Ahmednagar districts, for example, the innovative projects operated in only 40 out of over 1000 villages, even though they are particularly highly concentrated in this area compared to the rest of India. Also, the most successful projects enjoyed special treatment that will be difficult to replicate on a large scale. Spreading participatory watershed development throughout the country will not be easy. 

One continuing challenge for almost all projects is in designing interventions and organizing communities so that benefits are distributed more evenly to landless people, shepherds and women. These are the least influential community members and their needs and interests require special attention. Otherwise watershed projects can actually make them worse off than before by restricting their access to resources that contribute to their livelihoods. Unstructured interviews with these groups suggested that all of the Maharashtra projects have room for improvement in serving their needs. Some NGOs in Andhra Pradesh have developed innovative ways to build everyone's interests into the projects in advance, and other projects would gain by learning from them.

N2  - The climate change in the agricultural sector acting on multiple weather variables at different times
of the various crop cycles. In several cases by changing the mean level of variables (rainfall,
temperature, etc..), in other cases by changing the distribution of events. This work provides an
evaluation of the economic impact due to changes in multiple events, and to the associated
uncertainty. For this reason, a classical two-stage stochastic programming model was extend into a
three-stages model. The model is specified for an area of Sardinia, and examines the impact of
climate change on rainfall and hence on the availability of water for agriculture, and on maximum
temperatures and, therefore, on the requirements of some irrigated crops relevant to the agricultural
economy of the area. The effect of climate change is obtained by comparing the results of scenarios
that represent the climatic conditions in the current situation and in the future, obtained by
projecting to 2015 the climate trends of the last fifty years. The results show that the agricultural
sector of the area adapt itself with a low cost by use of land and cultural practices. This cost,
however, is very high for some farms that suffer a significant reduction of the income. There is also
an increase of the use of natural resources, in particularly groundwater. The economic impact of
these changes is due primarily to the decreased of water availability in the future. The availability of
water becomes the crucial factor to adapting to climate change, because the effects of temperature
can be compensate by increased the use of water resources.

N2  - This 2016 report provides an economic overview of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food system using the most recent
data available. It is meant to be a multi-purpose reference document that presents:
• the agriculture and agri-food system in the context of the Canadian economy and international markets; and,
• a snapshot of the composition and performance of the agriculture and agri-food system as it evolves in response to
challenges, opportunities and market developments.
The report begins with a special feature section on natural resource use and the environment. This section examines
the impact of agriculture on the environment and quantifies greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by Canada’s various
economic sectors, including agriculture. Historical levels of emission trends by agricultural sub-sector (e.g. livestock and
crop, land use, on-farm energy use) are provided, along with emissions/removals associated with land management
changes. Projected GHG emissions for the agriculture sector through 2030 are given. The remainder of the section
addresses Canada’s agricultural use of land and water resources, including types of agricultural land cover, water use
and consumption by sector, irrigation levels by province, farm size, farm type, and crop, as well as irrigation methods and
sources of irrigation water.
The rest of the report looks at the agriculture and agri-food system’s relevance to the Canadian economy, as measured
by its share of the Canadian gross domestic product (GDP) and number of jobs in Canada. It also reviews the sector’s
performance internationally, in terms of its share of agriculture and agri-food trade to total world trade and a snap shot
of each segment of the agriculture and agri-food system covering: primary agriculture, food processing, consumers and
food distribution. The report ends with an overview of government support to agriculture.
The report describes the Canadian agriculture and agri-food system as a modern, integrated and competitive supply
chain that is important to the Canadian economy. It is a dynamic and resilient system that constantly adapts to changing
consumer demands, technological advances and globalization.

N2  - The dairy industry in northern Victoria faced dramatic changes between 2001/02 and 2002/03. Drought resulted in a substantial decrease in availability, and subsequent increase in price, of irrigation water and supplementary feed. Most farms recorded substantial net cash flow deficits. Prior to 2002/03, a project had been established using case studies and a spreadsheet model to examine potential futures for different farm types. This approach was successfully adapted to examine drought impacts and recovery options under the vastly different prevailing circumstances. Several factors appear to have contributed to the adaptability of the approach, as follows:
• The approach considered many aspects of farm management systems, but was simple enough to allow adaptation.
• The project team and steering committee had developed a good understanding of the relationships between components of farming systems, enabling rapid adaptation of their mental frameworks.
• The approach focussed more on helping people question, discuss and learn, rather than providing an absolute answer.

N2  - China's fast growing economy has brought some environmental problems, especially in water administration. Inefficiencies in irrigation activities have created severe negative effects to the environment of rural communities, and the more serious water shortages hamper food production, too. Major questions at hand are, how to improve water use efficiency, to reduce negative external effects, to optimize water allocation in agriculture, to invest in water saving technologies, and to assure more water for high value added agriculture. This paper investigates the impacts of irrigation technologies and investments in water saving on the rural economy and the environment. By taking into account individual farmers' inclination to adopt modern water-saving technologies and governments' willingness to improve public water transit systems, we optimize water use in a Chinese watershed. The main contribution is a model that shows how to optimize spatial allocation and adoption of irrigation technology given farm and investment costs. The paper employs a mathematical, spatial programming model using GAMS for optimization. It shows the importance of water pricing and discusses various policy measures such as pricing and public conveyance. The model results are of value for policy makers and project managers to allocate water more efficiently, to optimize irrigation projects, and to provide references for farmers in applying water conservation technologies.

N2  - The irrigation sector plays a vital role in food production and rural economy. Realizing the importance
various reforms are carried out world over to modernize irrigation systems and make them more efficient. One such
approach is the decentralization of irrigation management from the government agencies to the end users. This
paper looks into the implementation of Irrigation Management Act in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh where
partial responsibility of irrigation management was transferred to the end users. Emphasis is given on the
administrative, governance, institutional and financial reforms carried out as per the act and the impact these
reforms had on the irrigation management. The success of such programs is highly dependent on effectiveness of the
execution and the financial resources available with the government which are often limited. Such programs will
reap desired benefits, if the end users are involved in more effective manner with greater autonomy and delegation
of authority. Also in view of financial scarcity with governments to carry out such large programs, the idea of
involving private sector investors in irrigation management may be a good option. Such alternative institutional
models can be considered to further improve the overall efficiency and management of the irrigation systems.

N2  - This research develops several indicators for assessing local vulnerability to climate change in the agricultural sector of Tocantins, Brazil, where the Inter-American Development Bank is carrying irrigation investments via the Development Program for the Southwest (PRODOESTE). Vulnerability to climate indicators are constructed from exposure and sensitivity indicators and estimated using panel data on yields and farmers’ profits as a function of climatic variables. Our baseline assessment indicates that those municipalities where PRODOESTE operates present medium to high levels of precipitation and temperature vulnerability, relative to the rest of Tocantins. In particular, temperature vulnerability is higher than precipitation vulnerability. We also find that vulnerability will increase in all municipalities due to climate change and it will be higher in the long-run and in more extreme climate change scenarios. Finally, irrigation is evaluated as a potential adaptation strategy and it is found to reduce climate vulnerability in the long-term, indicating that PRODOESTE’s irrigation investments may be successful at reducing vulnerability due to climate change.

Proceedings of the Second National Workshop on Strategic Issues in Indian Irrigation, New Delhi, India, 8-9 April 2009. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - This paper attempts to identify and evolve a method for valuing and estimating the net gains from domestic and industrial water supply from the interbasin transfer schemes contemplated in the National River Link Project (NRLP). An existing interbasin transfer (IBT) scheme, namely Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP) and a proposed IBT scheme namely Polavaram- Vijaywada (PV) Link Canal were chosen for detailed analyses. Secondary data were used for identifying the region and the populations that benefited from the schemes. Economic gains arising out of water supply to the actual or potentially benefited areas were estimated. The estimation involved assessment of current costs incurred by the people in the area, in terms of both paid-out costs and time spent in fetching water. The saving in time was valued at market wage rates prevalent in the area and paid-out costs were assessed in terms of current market prices, ignoring the administered prices involved. The gains to urban populations were assessed by estimating the reduction in energy costs incurred by municipal authorities in undertaking the supply. Amortized capital costs for putting necessary hardware for distributing water from the IBT schemes as well as operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of running these schemes were netted from the gains to obtain the figures for net economic gains. More indirect benefits such as reduced drudgery or improved educational performance as well as reduced health expenditure were recognized but were all ignored to ensure greater robustness in the estimates. Only net gains to the society were considered and hence gains arising out of creation of industrial estates within the commands were ignored since similar gains could also be obtained by locating these estates elsewhere. The net economic gains are seen to depend on both demographic features of the region and its ecology. Desert-like conditions of the IGNP-benefited areas tend to make the gains from domestic water supply schemes large, while similar gains in the Polavaram-Vijaywada areas are smaller. The net economic gains are of a significant order and would seem to indicate that, at least insofar as the dry areas of the country are concerned, these can perhaps exceed the gains due to increased agricultural production and hence could perhaps justify the creation of the schemes by themselves.

N2  - Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are being increasingly used as conservation instruments, particularly in Latin America. PES programs seek to capture part of the benefits derived from environmental services and channel them to natural resource managers who generate these services, thus increasing their incentive to conserve them. Many have assumed that these payments would go mostly to poor land users, and thus contribute to poverty reduction. There has been little empirical verification of this assumption to date, however. The PES approach was conceptualized as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of natural resource management, and not as a mechanism for poverty reduction. Pagiola et al. (2005) identified three main questions regarding the linkages between PES and poverty: (1) Who are the actual and potential participants in PES programs, and how many of them are poor? (2) Are poorer households able to participate in PES programs? And (3) are poor households affected indirectly by PES programs? We focus here on the first question of eligibility. This study examines whether the recipients of payments for environmental services are likely to be poor. Our focus is on watershed-scale PES mechanisms in which water users make payments to service providers. In Guatemala, as in other countries, it has long been argued that land users in marginal areas such as the steep slopes of upper watersheds tend to be poor. We use data from highland Guatemala to examine this assumed close spatial correlation between areas of high poverty and areas that provide environmental services. We first identify specific watershed areas in which PES mechanisms could potentially be developed, based on the presence of major downstream water uses such as hydroelectric power generation, domestic water supply, and irrigation. We then compare these areas with the spatial distribution of poverty in the country, allowing us to ask two questions that are central to the potential for PES to reach the poor: (1) How many of the potential providers of water services are poor? The local poverty impact of a PES program on poverty will depend on whether potential providers are poor or not. And (2) how many of the poor are potential water service providers? The potential impact of PES on poverty at a national scale will depend on whether many of the poor are in fact in areas where PES mechanisms might be implemented. Even if most potential PES recipients are poor, it may be that few of the poor are potential PES recipients. We map the ‘water supply areas’ by identifying the location of the intakes from which users obtain their water and then delineating the portions of the watershed that contribute to those intakes. About 1.9 million ha have significant potential for development of PES mechanisms through the presence of major water uses. This area is under-estimated as data could only be obtained for a subset of all users. All water supply areas are not equivalent. Some have substantial potential for PES because of the importance of downstream water uses, while others have more limited potential. For each user, we collect information on the nature and magnitude of their water use and construct use-specific indices of the relative importance or “value” of water supply areas. With about 56% of its population under the poverty line, Guatemala has one of the highest poverty rates in Central America. Using the watershed-level poverty map developed by Nelson and Chomitz (2007), we analyze both the poverty rate and the poverty density in water supply areas. Our analysis shows that both the poverty rate and the poverty density in the water supply areas vary substantially. The average poverty rate in water supply areas is only 44 percent, which is lower than the national average of 53%. There is essentially no correlation between the importance of a water supply area and the poverty rate of people living within it. The total number of poor that could potentially be reached if PES mechanisms were developed in all water supply areas is about 1.76 million, or 73% of the country’s poor. This analysis only considers the potential for PES programs to reach the poor. Even where many of the potential service providers are poor, it does not follow that the poor will get the benefits. A variety of obstacles, including insecure land tenure, lack of title, small farm holdings, and lack of access to credit might limit the participation by the poor in a PES program. The extent to which these problems prove to be obstacles in practice depends on the specific characteristics of the PES program and the conditions under which it is implemented.

N2  - Irrigation land suitability assessment and mapping play an imperative role for sustainable utilization of scarce physical land resources. The objectives of this study were to prepare spatial data base of physical land resources for irrigated agriculture and to assess land suitability for irrigation and developing suitable area map for the study area. The study was conducted at Fogera catchment, South Gondar. Soil and water sampling spots were selected based on free and grid survey techniques and their locations were taken using Global Positioning System (GPS). Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were used to develop irrigation land suitability map of the study area. Attributes of parameters were collected and used for suitability assessment. Attributes used as criteria for irrigation suitability analysis were ECe, ESP, soil depth, texture, pH, top and sub soil stoniness, water table depth, flood hazard, ground water quality (SAR and EC) and slope. Point data with their attribute were arranged and proximity analysis of Arc-GIS was made this resulted into twelve mapping units. The final irrigation suitability map of the project area was derived after overlay analysis. On the basis of stoniness, soil salinity, soil alkalinity, soil depth and groundwater quality it was concluded that 72 percent of the study area is potentially suitable for irrigation and 28 percent was classified as unsuitable (N) due to drainage limitation, flood hazard, texture and slope factors. Of the potentially suitable land, 1 percent was highly suitable (S1), 28 percent was moderately suitable (S2), and 43 percent is marginally suitable (S3).

N2  - Objetivou-se, neste trabalho, avaliar os impactos da Política Nacional de Irrigação (PNI), na bacia do rio São Francisco no Norte do
Estado de Minas Gerais, mais especificamente, os impactos do Projeto Jaíba Etapa I. Esse projeto, implantado em 1975, no município
de Manga, foi o primeiro e maior perímetro irrigado da região, ocupando uma área irrigável de 24.752 hectares. Do ponto de vista
metodológico, foi utilizado um método quase experimental de avaliação de impacto para verificar os fatores que caracterizavam os
municípios da bacia no período anterior às ações da PNI, bem como definir um grupo de municípios não beneficiados com a construção
do Projeto Jaíba (grupo de controle) para comparação com o município de Manga (beneficiado), cujo território abrangia os atuais
municípios de Jaíba e Matias Cardoso. As análises realizadas demonstraram que os impactos do projeto se manifestaram de formas
diferentes em relação aos indicadores examinados, sendo os indicadores econômicos os mais atingidos. Assim, conclui-se que o Projeto
Jaíba alcançou parcialmente os resultados esperados, pois, se por um lado, ocorreram impactos positivos na produção agrícola, na
geração de empregos e no crescimento do PIB per capita, por outro, nota-se que o projeto não teve força suficiente para impulsionar
os indicadores desenvolvimento humano e distribuição de renda do município beneficiado.

N2  - On September 11 and 12, 2017, a symposium on "Irrigation in agriculture", jointly organized by the Thünen Institute, the Julius-Kühn Institute and the University of Applied Sciences Ostfalia took place at the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, Campus Suderburg. For this purpose, experts from the field of irrigation were invited to give current assessments on the development of irrigation needs and the irrigation-worthiness of different crops at different locations in Ger-many as well as on the development of irrigation technology. The irrigation of crops in outdoor vegetables or special crops has long been a common practice. The profitability of irrigating agri-cultural crops in Germany has so far been limited to a few, dry locations. As a result of climate change, an increasing average annual temperature and changed precipitation patterns (in partic-ular lower rainfall at the beginning of the vegetation period in spring) have been observed in Germany for some years now. For the future, according to the results of climate models, a fur-ther increase in temperatures and further changes in the precipitation distribution such as a de-crease in the summer precipitation and an increase in winter precipitation are to be expected. The conference proceedings provide an overview of the latest research findings from the field of drought stress and discuss possible alternative sources for meeting the additional water require-ments of agricultural crops. Aspects of the landscape water balance and hydrological correlations in the agricultural landscape are addressed and solutions presented. Insights into possible con-flicts of water use and practical experience with the development of solutions are accompanied by the presentation of the legal framework for water use. The contributions are supplemented by reports of long-term irrigation field trials conducted by the LWK Lower Saxony. On the one hand, the experiments have shown that irrigation can increase the nutrient efficiency of crops and the quality of crops. On the other hand, the present state of the art of irrigation will be explained and limits and possibilities for increasing efficiency in the future will be presented. In order to in-crease the efficiency of irrigation, irrigation control is of great importance; its current status is presented and the trends for the future are shown. The profitability of investments in irrigation technology is presented in two contributions. Here, both the different techniques and their prof-itability in different crops are assessed economically. Possible developments of regional irrigation needs are exemplarily shown for the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The conference proceedings conclude with a chapter on the overview of previous projects in the field of water management and on irrigation of agricultural land in view of future climate change in Germany.

N2  - Current climate adaptation polices in Brazil are influencing not only the choice of crops but also many agricultural practices at the farm level including changes in planting and sowing periods, use of irrigation-saving technologies, and increased nitrogen fertilization, among others. The shape and content of these adaptation policies and measures for Brazil are not limited to production agriculture, but include also conservation reserve and risk-reducing farm programs. In addition, the decades-old adaptation and management strategies for agricultural production under tropical conditions carried out by EMBRAPA, Brazil’s premier agricultural research agency, continue to play a prominent role. As Brazil is one the world’s largest agricultural producers and exporters of agricultural commodities, impacts in Brazil that may occur under different climate scenarios could have broad implications for food supply and prices worldwide. We find that farmers’ adoption of adaptation strategies could result in significant increases in agricultural productivity, changes in suitable crop growing areas, reduced vulnerability to temperature changes, and improved income generation for farmers.

N2  - The State government has a vital role to play in developing groundwater resources to help improve the lot of the poorest people in eastern India's rural communities. Many States have tried to achieve this over the past 50 years through centrally planned public tube-well programs. Recently published research says that most of these efforts have failed to bring irrigation or improved livelihoods to the poor.
This research shows how policy makers can have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction by removing pump subsidies and opening pump markets to international competition. Subsidies and import restrictions have kept pump prices in India artificially inflated, by more than 35-45%, over those of neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh.
If a 'shock therapy' approach of removing restrictions is too drastic or politically difficult, the next best option is to use market mechanisms to manage pump subsidy and loan programs for the poor. A good example of this approach is the jointly managed subsidy programs that have helped usher in eastern India's belated Green Revolution. Here local pump dealers are active participants in the management of pump subsidy programs, alongside government and nationalized banks. The examples of eastern Uttar Pradesh and north Bihar provide working models of such approaches.

N2  - In this working paper, the biophysical factors and socio-economic conditions that led to Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULC) and land degradation in Burkina Faso are reviewed. It is found that the country is densely populated and population continues to rise at a rate of more than 3% a year. However, nearly half of the population still lives below the poverty line. The electrification relies heavily on fossil fuels as the country has limited hydropower potential and solar energy received little investment. The rate of electrification is still very low, triggering the use of other sources of energy derived from firewood in rural areas. In addition, Burkina Faso has experienced land degradation in the North as a consequence of the 1970s and 1980s droughts that struck all the Sahel. Subsequently, migration took place from the degraded areas to the central, western and southern regions of the country causing further LULC changes. Furthermore, the country suffers from the effects of climate change and climate variability through increasing temperature trends, highly variable precipitation regimes and intensification of extreme events. Projected changes reveal prevailing conditions that indicate an increased risk of disasters in the agriculture, water and health sectors, among others. Due to this situation, some technological responses and policy actions have been developed for sustainable land management and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The adopted technological approaches include, among others, irrigation expansion and efficiency, rainwater harvesting, crop diversification, adoption of drought-tolerant crop varieties and rotational grazing. Some policies have been put in place to facilitate the adoption of these technologies. They consist of carbon trading, land-use zoning and integrated landscape planning, payment for ecosystem services, providing access to markets and agricultural advisory services, securing land tenure and empowering women. These actions are part of broader programs and investment plans that include, but not limited to, the Strategic Framework for Poverty Reduction (SFPR), the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD), the National Rural Sector Program (PNSR), the Resilience and Support Plan for Vulnerable Population (RSPVP) and the Cereals Price Stabilization Program (CPSP) among others.

N2  - The simultaneous achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is, to say the least, challenging. In a situation of increasing and multiple demands over limited resources, pursuing each goal separately could lead to increased competition. The situation in Africa is particularly problematic, as the continent lags behind all others in terms of quality and quantity of infrastructure and counts the highest shares of population living in poverty and without access to food, safe water, and energy. At the same time, natural resources are under increasing pressure from population growth, environmental degradation, and climate change. Given the entity of the challenge, finding synergies and strengthening coordination across sectors will be crucial and the energy sector has an important role to play. As recognized in the Agenda 2030, the energy sector holds the key to many aspects of development, however no energy solution (albeit green or synergetic) should be casually labelled as a nexus solution. This could be deceiving also because of the ambiguities that surround the concept of nexus. In order to give concrete insights to policy makers, this paper proposes a pragmatic approach to the nexus that allows on one hand to detect areas where cooperation needs to be strengthened, on the other to explore the nexus potential of energy solutions. This is in line with a view of the nexus as a way of thinking, which can apply both at the level of policy making and in the actual implementation of projects. We will give three concrete examples to improve energy access at different levels: multipurpose hydropower for large-scale electricity production, solar pumps for irrigation in farms, and efficient cookstoves in households. These can catalyse much needed action in other areas (notably water supply, agriculture, and forestry) but realizing their potential requires stronger cooperation and coordination across sectors. Moreover, their successful implementation requires an honest and thorough assessment of the local context in terms of constraints as well as opportunities.

N2  - AB Provision of irrigation has been thought to be crucial in improving the livelihoods of millions of tribals in Central belt of India, who are locked in perpetual poverty. Green Revolution Technology, which has been at the heart of India’s agricultural development, has more or less bypassed the tribal population. For one, irrigation infrastructure is inadequate in the tribal regions and again when irrigation infrastructure is made available, the tribals do not seem to make adequate use of them. Creating demand for irrigation among the tribal farmers seems to be most important challenge. It is in this backdrop that we undertook our case study in a tribal dominated block of Gujarat. Unlike the other tribal dominated areas Jharkhand and Chattisgarh), the tribals in our study area were third generation farmers and therefore they faced no cognitive barriers in adopting irrigated agriculture. They are also as skilled a farmer as any other, which is reflected by the fact that there are no discernable yield differences between a tribal and a non-tribal farmer. We studied four canal irrigation schemes, which have been all turned over to the farmers at the behest of AKRSP (I)’s intervention. All these four schemes are tribal dominated, some of them are completely so, others have a handful of non-tribal population. The schemes we studied were Pingot RBMC, Baldeva LBMC, Pingot LBMC and Issar Minor Irrigation scheme. Our results confirm that irrigated agriculture has brought about tremendous benefits to a tribal farmer in the form of yield increases, higher cropping intensity, lower out migration and higher wage rates within the village. The trajectory of change for a typical tribal farming has been from cultivating local paddy in Kharif and migrating in Rabi and summer to cultivating hybrid paddy in kharif and irrigated groundnut or moong in summer. Irrigated agriculture has become central to their livelihoods and this in part explains why Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) has been more or less successful here. However, the non-tribal farmers have benefited more from PIM than tribal farmers, because they shifted to very lucrative sugarcane farming. The non-tribals (Patels) have also played a significant role in these irrigation co-operatives in that they have provided the much needed “demonstration effect” of profitability of irrigated agriculture. AKRSP (I)’s role as facilitator of PIM in Pingot RBMC and Baldeva LBMC has been acclaimed nationally. But we propose that the success of these two schemes lies in the creation of Pingot LBMC society, where tribal farmers came forward on their own and formed irrigation society to take over management of the canal system. The very fact that an all-tribal farmer group could successfully replicate PIM experiment in Gujarat that was started with Pingot RBMC and Baldeva LBMC is a proof enough for the success of PIM as a whole. We also propose that in the long term, the sustainability of PIM will depend on the overall profitability of irrigated agriculture and therefore efforts should be made to make farming a more profitable venture for the tribal farmers. Encouraging them to shift to highly lucrative crops such as sugarcane and orchard crops could perhaps make irrigated agriculture more profitable in future.

Development on Rural Poverty and the
Environment” emphasis was given to the rural development of communities performing irrigation. Main goal was to analyze the potential of irrigation development, which should be performed in an environmentally sound way to ensure good living conditions for future generations. Environmentally sound
means to maintain soil fertility, water quality, to be concerned about health impacts and maintaining biodiversity. The starting point for this review is an
irrigation database, a classification of irrigation schemes in Ethiopia and the resulting selection of case studies of irrigation schemes. The study aims to support the clarification of environmental factors and processes related to irrigation development. The socioeconomic
implications of environmental impacts of
irrigation investments such as links to poverty, health and policies and institutions will also be treated. The methods used include field measurements and observations, laboratory analyses, structured questionnaire surveys and PRA.
The investigated field studies performed under the project’s specific task “Assessment of generic environmental and health issues as related to irrigated agricultural development” are presented. The collected material is compiled and made accessible through a database. The case studies results are critically

N2  - Rural livelihood in arid irrigated areas is hampered by water scarcity, land degradation and climate change. Studies showed a possibility to tackle these challenges by establishing tree plantations on marginal croplands as supported by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forestation programs. Despite the environmental impact such projects would also affect the decision making of rural population by changing their land use activities, incomes and consumption structures. Thus, this study further analyzed the impact of CDM forestation on rural livelihood by considering rural interdependencies via wage-labor relations of agribusiness-operated farms and rural households in the Khorezm province and southern districts of Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan. We developed a farm-household dynamic programming model that jointly maximizes farm profits and rural households net incomes over a 15-years horizon under the scenario of decreasing irrigation water availability and plantation forestry with a seven year rotation period. The analysis showed that shortly following a land use change towards afforestation, the farm demand for rural households’ labor would decline thus decreasing the household incomes. Yet, later on after harvesting tree plantations, in year seven, the farm benefits would be transmitted to rural households via access to cheaper fuelwood and leaves as fodder, as well as via improved land use activities. The availability of fuelwood from tree plantations would significantly decrease CO2 emissions of households by substituting fossil fuels, while leaves would reduce expenditures for livestock fodder. These substitution effects would lead to the increase of income and in turn improve households’ food consumption. Besides, given the low irrigation demand of trees, a conversion of marginal cropland to tree plantations would increase the irrigation water availability for other productive croplands. These changes would lead that tree plantations would increase in year seven profits of farmer (up to 39,200 USD) and net incomes of rural households (up to 12,700 USD). Whereas when only conventional land uses are followed the decline in water availability would reduce profits of farm (from 13,000 USD to 9,850 USD) and net incomes of rural households (from 11,900 to 10,500 USD) over the modeled period. Overall, we argue that the implementation of the short-term CDM forestation could help cushion repercussions of water shortages on rural livelihoods, sustaining energy, income and food security, as well as mitigating climate change in drylands.

N2  - Irrigation occupies a central position in China’s crop production. However, due to low per capita water resources, much worse, unevenly distributed over regions and time and the rapid increase of water diversions to non-irrigation sectors, irrigation water shortages have become a very serious problem. Without the adoption of effective measures this problem may even threaten China’s food security. Currently, irrigation efficiency is very low in general, irrigation water prices cannot fully recover water supply costs, and irrigation facilities are aging due to the lack of funding for O&amp;M (operation &amp; maintenance). Since water prices are regulated by the government, and not determined by the market, water prices did not work effectively in water allocation. The adoption of more economic incentive measures, such as increasing water prices, has become the main strategy of the Chinese government. Since 1 January 2004, China has carried out a new water pricing regulation. The main objectives of this regulation are that water price should be increased to fully recover water supply cost and that water should be treated as a market good. In non-irrigation sectors, the consensus is that water price could be charged to fully recover water supply cost. However, there is still controversy over the charge of irrigation water pricing. Indeed, increasing water price to fully recover supply cost may seriously affect grain production, and farmers’ income. Past studies in China on these issues mainly focused on the theoretical aspects of the problem, analyzing whether irrigation water price should be increased or not. Little studies have quantified the potential impact of the reforms in China. The following questions need to be elaborated: Are irrigation water pricing reforms effective?; What are the attitudes of the farmers towards the reforms?; How do farmers respond to water pricing reforms?; What comprehensive methods should be adopted to achieve the goals of the reforms?
This project is based on the analysis of three case studies (Wudu, Jinghuiqu, and Shijin irrigation districts). Jinghuiqu is located in an arid region, Shijin is located in a semi-arid region and Wudu is located in the more humid Southwest. All the issues mentioned above, have been studied using econometric methods on the basis of the data gathered at the household, field canal, pump, and village level. The study reveals that the farmers’ ability to pay for irrigation water is still low and that the current water prices reflect the farmers’ willingness to pay, which implies that it is in fact very difficult to increase water prices further, let alone fully recover water supply cost. Farmers do not really participate in the irrigation management process, even at the field canal level, which limits the farmers’ willingness to pay. In areas confronted with severe water shortages, such as in the Jinghuiqu and Shijin irrigation districts, it is estimated that the volume of water use significantly affects wheat and maize yields, and the reduction of field water use will lead to the decline of grain production. In such cases, although increasing irrigation water price will encourage farmers to reduce water use, it may also force them to decrease their grain production. These measures affect the farmers’ revenues, which are largely dependent on crop production, thus increasing social inequities. Other policies need to protect weaker groups, such as poor farmers and farmers whose income mainly depends on crops. For instance, water property has still not been initialized and both irrigation bureaus and farmers lack incentives to adopt water-saving technologies. Initiating water property, expanding low-cost water-saving technologies, reforming irrigation management and fostering a water market are all important measures to achieve the policy goals of water-saving. At this point, it is necessary to emphasize that surface water price reforms may deeply affect groundwater resources use, especially in the conjunctive irrigation areas. Without the enhancement of groundwater resources management, saving surface water may lead to more overexploitation of groundwater resources, such was the case in the Jinghuiqu and Shijin irrigation districts.
All in all, irrigation water price reforms represent a revolution when compared with traditional irrigation water resource management in China. Comprehensive and integrated policies should be carried out. China being such a large country, reforms cannot be uniform in all areas. Different areas, with different precipitation levels, should adopt different measures. In most parts of South China, volumetric water pricing is not appropriate, since this method requires large infrastructure investments. Collecting water fees on the basis of the farmers’ irrigated area is an alternative policy, although it requires involving farmers in the irrigation management process. Even in the northern regions, the standards of irrigation infrastructure should not be overemphasized and more attention should be paid to the cost-benefits analysis of irrigation investments.

N1  - Replaced with revised version of paper 07/24/09.
N2  - Agricultural productivity growth in Chinese provinces during the 1994-2005 period is examined using two alternative approaches: a parametric stochastic frontier and a non-parametric Malmquist index. These models are suitable to the Chinese situation due to the existence of procurement prices, quotas, and other interventions that have distorted prices. Results show that there is high but declining productivity growth rates in the mid 1990’s with productivity growth decreasing in the late 1990’s but with a reversal of the trend around 1998 when growth rates start accelerating. A stochastic frontier translog production function is estimated to obtain an alternative measure of total factor productivity growth. Results are compared across these two models. Although average growth in technical change is similar in the two models, the regional rates are dissimilar. 
A model that includes three variables hypothesized to explain the difference in performance across regions is also estimated. The three variables included in the model are irrigation ratio, illiterate ratio and agriculture expenditure level. These variables make allowance for the difference of land and labor quality and the effect of public inputs. The irrigation ratio and agriculture expenditure are found to positively relate to the technical efficiency change and the illiterate ratio is found to negatively relate to the technical efficiency change. The results are consistent with expectations.

N2  - Although a handful of forage species such as perennial ryegrass are predominant, there are a wide range of forage species that can be grown in sub tropical and temperate regions in Australia as dairy pastures. These species have differing seasonal yields, nutrient quality and water use efficiency characteristics, as demonstrated in a large study evaluating 30 species University of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. Some species can be grazed, while others require mechanical harvesting that incurs a further cost. Previous comparisons of species that relied on yields of dry matter per unit of some input (typically land or water) cannot simultaneously take into account the season in which forage is produced, or other factors related to the costs of production and delivery to the cows. To effectively compare the profitability of individual species, or combinations of species, requires the use of a whole-farm model. Linear programming was used to find the most profitable mix of forage species for an irrigated dairy farm in an irrigation region of New South Wales, Australia. It was concluded that a typical farmer facing the prevailing milk and purchased feed prices with average milk production per cow would find a mix of species including large proportions of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii) was most profitable. The result was robust to changes in seasonal milk pricing and moving from year round to seasonal calving patterns.

N2  - Impacts on Australian agriculture of projected climate change are likely to be spatially and temporally diverse, with many regions likely to experience increased downside risk in agricultural production. Some regions, such as south-west Australia, are projected to be particularly at risk of adverse outcomes associated with climate change.

The rate and extent of warming, along with impacts on rainfall distributions, are key determinants of agricultural impacts and will affect the success of adaptation strategies. The likely gradual unfolding of climate change should provide farmers in many regions and industries with sufficient time to utilise or develop adaptation strategies. Many of these strategies are likely to be based on farmers’ current responses to climate variability. Investments in R&amp;D and innovation could be important ingredients in facilitating farmers’ adaptation to climate change. 

Farmers are likely to face additional costs of capital adjustment due to climate change. Investment in long-lived climate-dependent agricultural assets such as irrigation infrastructure, vineyards and agroforestry will become more problematic. Investing in ecological assets in rural regions, especially where these assets may become stranded by climate change, also will be increasingly problematic.

N2  - Helicoverpa spp. (heliothis) are a major insect pest of cotton, grains and horticulture in the Murray‐ Darling Basin. Climate change is likely to make conditions more favourable for heliothis. This could cause regional comparative advantages in irrigation systems to change as management costs increase and yields decrease. Irrigation in the Murray Darling Basin produces 12 percent of Australia’s total gross value of agricultural production. If producers fail to consider climate change impacts on heliothis they may misallocate resources.Adamson et al. (2007 and 2009) have used a state contingent approach to risk and uncertainty to illustrate how producers could allocate irrigation resources based on climate change impacts on water resources. This is achieved by separating environmental risks and uncertainties into defined states of nature to which the decision makers have a set of defined responses. This approach assumes that the decision makers can achieve optimal allocation of resources as they have perfect knowledge in how they should respond to each state of nature (i.e. producers know how to manage heliothis now). Climate change brings a set of new conditions for which existing state parameters (mean and variance) will alter. Consequently a decision maker will have incomplete information about the state description; and the relationship between state allocable inputs and the associated state dependent output, until they have experienced all possible outcomes. Therefore if producers ignore climate changes to heliothis they may lock in resources that may prove to be unprofitable in the long run. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a framework that could be used for determining climate change impacts of heliothis (i.e. density), illustrate that management costs rise as density increases and how a stochastic function could deal with incomplete knowledge in a state contingent framework.

N2  - Climate change is likely to have substantial effects on irrigated agriculture. It is anticipated that many areas that are already dry will become drier, while areas that already receive high rainfall may experience further increases. Extreme climate events such as droughts are likely to become more common. These patterns are evident in projections of climate change for the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia. To understand the effects of climate change, as modified by mitigation and adaptation, active management responses designed to improve returns in particular states of nature, such as in the case of drought must be considered. A change in the frequency of drought will induce a change in the allocation of land and water between productive activities. Even with action to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at or near current levels, climate change will continue for some decades and adaptation will therefore be necessary. Conversely, most adaptation strategies are feasible only if the rate and extent of climate change is limited by mitigation. In this paper, a simulation model of state-contingent production is used to analyze these issues.

N2  - Climate change is likely to have substantial effects on irrigated agriculture. Extreme climate events such as droughts are likely to become more common. These patterns are evident in median projections of climate change for the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia. Understanding climate change effects on returns from irrigation involves explicit representation of spatial changes in natural stocks (i.e. water supply) and their temporal variability (i.e. frequency of drought states of nature) and the active management responses to capital stocks represented by mitigation and alternative adaptation strategies by state of nature . A change in the frequency of drought will induce a change in the allocation of land and water between productive activities. In this paper, a simulation model of state-contingent production is used to analyze the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In the absence of mitigation, climate change will have severe adverse effects on irrigated agriculture in the Basin. However, a combination of climate mitigation and adaptation through changes in land and water use will allow the maintenance of agricultural water use and environmental flows.

N2  - Policies to devolve responsibility for natural resource management to local bodies have become widespread in the past 20 years. Although the theoretical advantages of user management have been convincing and the impetus for devolution policies strong, the actual outcomes of devolution programs in various sectors and countries have been mixed. This paper summarizes key research findings on factors that contribute to effective devolution programs in the forestry, fisheries, irrigation, and rangelands sectors, which were presented and discussed at an international Policy Workshop on Property Rights, Collective Action and Devolution of Natural Resource Management, June 21-25, 1999, in Puerto Azul, the Philippines. We begin by addressing the language of devolution in an effort to clarify concepts and terminology that enable a more productive discussion of the issues. This is followed by some of the key arguments made by the workshop participants for devolving rights to resources to local users. Policies and factors that have the potential to strengthen or constrain devolution are addressed at a broad level before looking specifically at how property rights and collective action institutions can shape devolution outcomes. Whereas some factors cut across resource sectors and regions, others are more specific to their contexts. In all cases, proponents of devolution of rights to resource users struggle to understand better what elements facilitate collective action and what factors hinder its creation and sustainability. Finally, a set of recommended frameworks formulated by the workshop participants highlight the potential for fostering a devolution process that leads to the simultaneous improvement of natural resource management and the livelihoods of the poor.

N2  - The study is conveyed to compare the profitability of chickpea and boro rice in Rajshahi district, which is one of the most drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. In this study, a total of 180 farmers (90 chickpea growers and 90 boro rice growers) are used as sample respondents, and data were collected by using a structured questionnaire in 2019. A probit regression model is used to find out the determinants that affect the cultivation of chickpea and boro rice. The important finding of this study is that the Benefit-Cost Ratio for chickpea and boro rice production is 1.88 and 1.05, respectively. The results indicate that chickpea cultivation is more profitable than boro rice cultivation. Besides, the study reveals that occupation, farm size, and seed have a positive impact while family size, human labor, and irrigation have negative effects on farmer’s decision to cultivate chickpea cultivation rather than boro rice. It is, therefore, concluded that the farmers should be encouraged to grow more chickpea rather than boro rice as a means of increasing farm income through crop diversification program.

N2  - This research analyzes two groundwater conservation policies in the Kansas High Plains
located within the Ogallala aquifer: 1) cost-share assistance to increase irrigation efficiency;
and 2) incentive payments to convert irrigated crop production to dryland crop production. To
compare the cost-effectiveness of these two policies, a dynamic model simulated a representative
irrigator’s optimal technology choice, crop selection, and irrigation water use over
time. The results suggest that the overall water-saving effectiveness can be improved when
different policy tools are considered under different conditions. High prevailing crop prices
greatly reduce irrigators’ incentive to give up irrigation and therefore cause low enrollment
and ineffectiveness of the incentive payment program. In areas with low aquifer-saturated
thickness, the incentive payment program is more effective, whereas in areas with relatively
higher water availability, the cost-share program could be a better choice.

N2  - In Zacatecas, agriculture consumes 77% of the underground water; 44% of the aquifers are over extracted. All protected agriculture production systems pump water from the aquifers for irrigation, and 96% of the production units were constructed with government support. They also receive support for inputs and domestic production factors. This paper analyzes the impact of agricultural policy on protected tomato production in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico, by examining competitive and efficient technologies and considering alternative sustainable production practices. The Extended Policy Analysis Matrix was applied. The analysis included four technologies under current conditions and two scenarios: a) adoption of sustainable production practices and b) unsustainable practices, at economic and private prices. The sustainable project paid for itself under both private and economic prices.

N1  - Presented at the 25th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis (Virtual Conference)
N2  - Countries have committed themselves to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, such as Zero Hunger (SDG2), and Life on Land (SDG15). Many countries are still far from reaching the targets as expressed in these goals. To help steer these developments, the necessary transitions in the food system of a country for achieving healthy and affordable diets for all people need to identified, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. The transition to healthy diets means a change in the demand for and consumption of various agricultural commodities. This change in demand will drive price changes, both for consumers and at the farm gate. This affects agricultural incomes, domestic food production and patterns of trade. Changes in domestic food production will in turn alter land use patterns, fertilizer use and other agricultural inputs which have environmental consequences with respect to land demand for agriculture, nutrient emissions, greenhouse gas emissions and irrigation water demand. In this study we investigate a number of aspects of this challenge by linking a biophysical (BIOSPCAS) and an economic (MAGNET) model, and simulating consequences of a transition to a healthy diet in Ethiopia in 2030. The impacts of economic and environmental consequences of a transition to a healthy diet in Ethiopia are compared with the SSP2 (O’Neill et al. 2017) business as usual future projections of the Ethiopian economy and agricultural system in 2030 with the current patterns of consumption, to illustrate the differences and highlight the impacts of the transition. Further as domestic food prices are linked to the global marketplace for agricultural commodities, we explore a scenario where the rest world makes the transition to a healthy diet as well. This global transition will affect the demand for Ethiopian exports and the prices for imports facing farmers and consumers.

N2  - Water for irrigation and irrigation infrastructure are both common pool resources, due to their low excludability and high rivalry. The wellknown common pool resource dilemma is often the consequence. Collective action may be a way how societies can overcome this dilemma. First results from a three-month empirical field study in Bulgaria are presented trying to explain how actor groups characteristics, such as lack of trust between community members and effective institutional settings at the local level, such as information asymmetry, limited sanctioning and enforcement mechanisms and almost no monitoring mechanisms provide conditions under which opportunistic behaviour dominates. The effective rules-in-use in local communities are presented. The simplest example is watering crops without paying the water price. Individuals will use their power to maintain their opportunistic strategies and, consequently, they will not agree to any rule change. Moreover, the actors` attitude towards collective action is very pessimistic. This has a crucial impact on the evolving of credible commitment which is one prerequisite for collective action. The effects on water management can be severe and the common pool resource dilemma situation may continue. This article questions if there are additional influencing variables inherited from the transformation process that will have an impact on the institutional change and constrain the emergence of collective action solutions. The discussion is based on empirical material from Varbiza village in the south of Bulgaria.

The project is based on a series of experiments carried out with farmers, environmental officers and researchers (Aquae proyect) on the Aveyron-Lere catchment area. Within this framework: 1) a model of the catchment was constructed in order to examine water consumption and nitrate losses in the area, and 2) scenarios were simulated so as to assess possible management improvement. Two types of scenarios were tested with the objective of limiting water use to available volumes and reducing nitrate losses: first, irrigation and fertilization optimization; after that crop rotation management at local scale (in the five zones defined in the catchment), as well as the scale of the whole basin. The model allows the evaluation, for the different management scenarios, the cost for the farmers of respecting current water and fertilization regulations, as a function of the inter-annual climatic variability.

N2  - Decades of Soviet rule have left a heritage of environmental and social problems
in Central Asia. The demise of an entire ecosystem at unprecedented pace, the
"Aral Sea Syndrome", is the most prominent of the undesired outcomes of the
focus on agricultural production that has dominated land and resource use and
continues till today. The international outcry over this ecological crisis has delegated
other – and maybe more urgent – problems to a second pane. Rural livelihoods
are rapidly deteriorating, unemployment is high, and rural poverty widespread.
Ecological aspects, although strongly affecting everyday life in rural areas – such as
water and soil salinity and environmental pollution – are not the fore most concern
to the local population, as the economic survival is the more pressing need.
Nevertheless, it is exactly in this situation where the larger part of the population
exploits the natural resources further rather than preserving the ecological basis
as a natural means of the local land’s productivity.
Since their independence in 1991, the five countries of Central Asia have dealt
with these challenges in different ways. Uzbekistan has opted for slow, gradual
reforms, keeping a strong government control over agricultural production. Its agricultural
sector is still characterized by a dominance of state ordered crops, mainly
cotton and winter wheat which are sold to state agencies. State control and the
lack of land ownership, true privatization (land is leased, not owned) and skills are
widely seen as the major causes for the rural poverty and rampant environmental
degradation. According to common opinion, the slow pace of reforms and the
strong government control have aggravated environmental degradation and social
problems. Careful analysis shows that the real picture is more complex and less
straightforward than a quick look at the system would suggest, however.
It is here that the Center's for Development Research (ZEF) project on "Economic
and Ecological Restructuring of Land- and Water Use in the Region Khorezm
(Uzbekistan)" sees its role. In this rural economy the use of natural resources,
economic performance and the related social dimensions are closely linked. The
innovative approach of the project is to tackle the issues at stake with a strongly
interdisciplinary approach. Economists, social scientists and natural scientists are
working together to analyse the on-going changes in land and water use, allowing
a deeper insight into the causal change between land use, poverty and environmental
degradation. The results of some of the individual research projects –
some of them surprising – are the subject of this book and will provide the basis for recommendations and solutions for decision-makers that address the ecological
deterioration as well as its economic and social consequences. The project aims
at providing a comprehensive, science-based plan for restructuring, at three nested
intervention levels: Markets, policies and institutions, and technologies. Modelling
will assist in developing scenarios of different levels of resource use and provide
decision makers with information as to the future consequences of the decisions
taken today.
These concepts are being developed in a long-term scientific research program
with the ultimate goal of improving rural livelihoods through judicious and sustainable
land and water resource management. There is a specific regional focus
on the Khorezm district of Uzbekistan, and the main partner is the State University
of Urgench (capital of the Uzbek region Khorezm). The co-operation is based on
strong links built with local partners and international agencies for technical cooperation.
Most prominent in this context are the collaborative agreements with
UNESCO and with the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources Management
of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The cooperation with both partners is essential,
not least because they will further ensure a strong embedding in national policy
making and capacity building efforts.
Khorezm is a district of the Republic of Uzbekistan, located in the irrigated lowlands
of the Amu Darya River, which is the major tributary to the Aral Sea. It is
in many ways an example of all of the irrigated lands along the rivers that cut
through the Middle Asian deserts – mostly flatland, former desert areas that are
irrigated for hundreds – if not sometimes even thousands of years – which have
been subjected to huge changes in the last 40-50 years by means of immense
irrigation projects that represent a very strong path dependency for today’s efforts
to manage the resources in the region.
From the outset the main donor of the project, the Federal Ministry of Education
and Research (BMBF) of Germany, understood that such a project can be developed
only with a long-term perspective. The project was laid out for 10 to 12
years, structured into four phases of which the first two have been completed so
far. Phase I saw the establishment of central databases and infrastructure, and
Phase II field surveys and trials for understanding institutions and processes,
that allowed the development of simulation and optimization models. Phase III
will be dedicated to testing an integrated concept for restructuring land use in a
typical area of the region, on-farm, which will lead in Phase IV to the development
of policy recommendations and a contribution to informed decision making
by Uzbek policy makers, by the water administration, and by farmers.
The present volume represents preliminary results of the research undertaken
mainly in the social and economic realm during project phase I and part of
phase II. It combines the contributions from a workshop held at Bonn University
in April 2005. Its intention is manifold: First it provides basic information related to ongoing changes in land and water use and thereby enhances the knowledge
base for judging the effects of further change. Second, it describes those research
tools which have been adapted by colleagues to become suitable for this region
in transition and for the given historical background. One other goal was to
enhance the analytical capacity on the basis of which solutions and/or recommendations
are to be developed. As the articles are the result of phase I and, to
some extent, of phase II of the project, they are "work in progress".
This book should be seen in the context of two forthcoming volumes: One on the
diverse aspects of tree intercropping systems in the Central Asian regions, and
another that will provide an integrative view of the research undertaken in the
first years of this project.
We would like to thank all partners, and particularly our colleagues from Uzbekistan,
for having made this book possible. Without the close cooperation in this
international, multicultural research team, the achievement would not have been
possible. Most prominently we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Alimboy Sadullaev,
Dr. Ruzumboy Eshchanov and Prof. Dr. Bahtiyor Ruzmetov from the State
University of Urgench who have always supported this project unfalteringly and
with great enthusiasm and continue to do so.
Furthermore, we would like to thank those who have helped in editing the text.
In that respect the special attention given to this volume by our colleague
Jennifer Franz is greatly appreciated. Thanks also go to Guzal Matniyazova,
Elena Kan, and Vefa Moustafaev for their support and the provision and correction
of Russian abstracts. We finally would like to acknowledge the never failing
efforts by Sandra Staudenrausch, Eva Niepagenkemper and Kirsten Kienzler with
editing, formatting and endless bug-chasing. Without them, the edition of this
book would have been delayed much more! And of course our most sincere thanks
go to Paul. L.G. Vlek, Director at ZEF, who initiated this project. Without his
guidance and support, his unwavering efforts for raising the necessary funds and
his readiness to always openly discuss the topics and problems of agriculture in
Central Asia, this book would never have been possible. Last but not least, we
also are greatly indebted to the BMBF for its continuous efforts to provide the
project funds, and we would like to thank especially Dr. Jürgen Heidborn and
Dr. Susanne Kieffer at BMBF, as well as Dr. Ingo Fitting from Project Management
Jülich for their never failing support.

N2  - The study is a descriptive survey done at Mpolonjeni ADP which is a representative sample for the project as it is affected by climate change and variability. This is evident as there is high level of food insecurity, crop failure, poverty and hunger Mpolonjeni ADP. The increased involvement of food relief agencies nearly on an annual basis is a clear indication that agricultural production, the mainstay of the areas has drastically fallen, and households’ livelihoods are at risk. The objectives of the study were to identify the impact of climate change on crop production, identify private adaptation strategies, conduct a cost benefit analysis for the adaptation strategies identified and identify socioeconomic factors influencing the choice of households when adapting to climate change. Sample was randomly selected and personal interviews were conducted. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Ricardian regression model, cost benefit analysis and multinomial logistic model. The results indicated that temperatures are increasing and rainfall is decreasing and this reduces maize yields. Adaptation strategies used are; drought resistant varieties, switching crops, irrigation, crop rotation, mulching, minimum tillage, early planting, late planting and intercropping. Switching crops has the highest NPV, where maize (E14.40) should be substituted with drought tolerant crops such as cotton (E1864.40), sorghum (E283.30) and dry beans (292.20). Factors influencing the choice of adaptation were; age of household head, occupation of household head, belonging to a social group , land category , access to credit, access to extension services training, high incidences of crop pest and disease, high input prices, high food prices, perceptions of households towards climate change. From the results, it is recommended that households should grow drought tolerant crops such as cotton, sorghum and dry beans instead of maize. The government should provide irrigation system, strengthen extension services and subsidise inputs. Further studies should analyse by CEA and MCA.

London, UK: Earthscan; Ottawa, Canada: International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - Interventions proposed and implemented for the mitigation of diarrhoeal diseases associated with wastewater reuse in agriculture have received little, if any, comparative assessment of their cost-effectiveness. This chapter assesses the costs, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the so-called ‘treatment’ and ‘non- or post-treatment’ interventions as well as a combination of these for wastewater irrigation in urban Ghana using an approach that integrates quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) for the treatment and non-treatment interventions assessed ranged from US$31/DALY to US$812/DALY averted. Risk-reduction measures targeting farming practices and the basic rehabilitation of local wastewater treatment plants were the most attractive interventions with a CER well below the threshold of US$150/DALY, sometimes considered as the upper limit for a health intervention to be cost-effective in developing countries. All combinations associated with the basic rehabilitation of the treatment plants, with either on-farm or post-harvest interventions or both, resulted in CERs within the range of US$40/DALY to US$57/DALY. However, the CERs for the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant either as an independent intervention or in combination with on-farm and post-harvest interventions were unattractive in view of health-risk reduction for wastewater irrigation. Although attractive, the CERs of non-treatment options are largely dependent on compliance (adoption) by farmers and food vendors. In this regard, the CER increased by almost fivefold when the adoption rate was only 25 per cent by farmers and food vendors; but was attractive as long as adoption rates did not fall below 70 per cent. On the other hand, the success of the treatment option depends on the functionality of the treatment plants which is not without challenges in a country like Ghana. Thus, this chapter stresses the need for a balanced risk-management approach through a combination of treatment and non-treatment interventions to hedge against failures that may affect CERs at any end. While this chapter provides a contribution to the debate on interventions for health-risk mitigation in wastewater irrigation, more case studies would be useful to verify the data presented here.

Water balance method was adopted to study the water requirement and water consumption law of cotton under mulched drip irrigation in Tarim Irrigated Area. Statistical analysis of experimental data of irrigation indicates that the relationship between yield of cotton and irrigation presents a quadratic parabola. We fit the model of cotton water production on the basis of field experimental data of cotton. And the analysis on water saving Benefit of cotton under mulched drip irrigation was done. Results indicate that water requirements for the irrigated cotton are 543 mm in Tarim Irrigated Area. The water requirements of seedling stage is 252 mm, budding stage is 186 mm, bolling stage is 316 mm and wadding stage is 139 mm. the irrigation amount determines the spatial distribution of soil moisture and water consumption during cotton life cycle. However, water consumption at different growth stages was inconsistent with irrigation. Quantitatively, the water consumed by cotton decreases upon the increase of irrigation amount. From the perspective of water saving, the maximal water use efficiency can reach 3 091 m3/ha. But the highest cotton yield needs 3464 m3/ha irrigation water. In summary, compared to the conventional drip irrigation, a number of benefits in water saving and yield increase were observed when using plastic mulch. At the same amount of irrigation, the cotton yield with plastic mulch was 30.2% higher than conventional approaches, and the efficiency of water utilization increased by 30.2%. While at the same yield level, 29.3% water was saved by using plastic mulch, and the efficiency increased by 41.5%.

N2  - Water availability, at the right time and in appropriate quantity is at the heart of agricultural practices worldwide; and the availability of water is largely dependent on the use of energy to pump it. Energy use also drives many other farm operations – tilling, sowing, harvesting and the manufacture of chemical fertilisers. We have, over the years, tended to overuse both water and energy in agricultural operations; practices that are now at odds with the challenges due to the emerging changes in hydrology and the increasing global concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs). It has been argued that water-use efficiency and energy efficiency in agriculture are self-regulating phenomena, largely driven by water and energy prices. This is only partially correct now. Climate change requires us to effectively decarbonise our economies by the third quarter of this century. This implies that agricultural operations will need to become fossil-fuel free in the next two decades. We believe that this requires three parallel interventions: (i) enhance water-use efficiency and energy-use efficiency in agricultural operations; (ii) convert agricultural operations to use electricity instead of fossil fuels; and (iii) decarbonise the electricity supply by converting to renewable sources, instead of fossil fuels, as energy sources for electricity generation. All the three interventions require policies, incentives, and regulations for their initial acceptance, commercial model development, and large-scale replication. However, the first two interventions require actions mainly by farmer-entrepreneurs, while the third intervention requires action both by the farmer-entrepreneurs (through generating their own solar electricity) as well as by electricity generation companies. What would these interventions look like? An example that covers all the three interventions is the promotion of energy-efficient solar pumps for irrigation accompanied by micro-irrigation facilities, with the excess electricity being bought by the electricity distribution company. The micro-irrigation facilities and the energy-efficient pump reduce the requirement for water pumping, and consequently the electricity needed to pump it, thus reducing the cost of the expensive solar panels. At the same time, the purchase, by others, of the excess electricity provides a revenue stream for farmer-entrepreneurs, which enables them to invest in the solar panels, energy-efficient pump and micro-irrigation facilities, as well as minimise fertiliser and water use. Another example is the promotion of energy-efficient electric tillers, harvesters and other farm equipment. These avoid greenhouse gas emissions, at the user level, and provide the potential to contribute to zero-GHG agriculture with the decarbonisation of the electricity grid. Energy-efficient solar pumps with micro-irrigation facilities are already less expensive, on a lifetime cost basis, as compared to flood irrigation by inefficient diesel or electric pumps. Similarly, electric machinery is cheaper than diesel-run machinery, though the capital cost is higher for electricitydriven machinery, such as electric tractors which require onboard storage of electricity in batteries. The major challenge that these interventions face is the creation of demand for the zero-GHG energy-efficient options (so that economies of scale can drive down prices); and the availability of capital (loans) for farmer-entrepreneurs to invest in these options. These are challenges that have been successfully overcome in the past – in enabling the Green Revolution, and more recently in building the market demand for energy-efficient refrigerators and air conditioners, buildings, etc. Drops for crops are essential; energy efficiency provides us with the entry point to enable a perfect storm for change – which addresses the wellbeing of the farmer-entrepreneurs and local water availability, as well as global climate concerns.

N2  - The construction of large dams is one of the most costly and controversial forms of public infrastructure investment in developing countries, but little is known about their impact. This paper studies the productivity and distributional effects of large dams in India. To account for endogenous placement of dams we use GIS data and the fact that river gradient affects a district's suitability for dams to provide instrumental variable estimates of their impact. We find that, in a district where a dam is built, agricultural production does not increase but poverty does. In contrast, districts located downstream from the dam benefit from increased irrigation and see agricultural production increase and poverty fall. Overall, our estimates suggest that large dam construction in India is a marginally cost-effective investment with significant distributional implications, and has, in aggregate, increased poverty.

N2  - Desertification is a condition of human-induced land degradation that occurs in arid, semiarid and dry sub-humid regions (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration or P/ETP 0.05 to 0.65) and leads to a persistent decline in economic productivity (&gt; 15% of the potential) of useful biota related to a land use or a production system. Climatic variations intensify the decline in productivity, restorative management mitigates it. Drylands or territories susceptible to desertification occupy 39.7% (~5.2 billion ha) of the global terrestrial area (~ 13 billion ha). The highest concentration of drylands occurs in Africa, Asia and Australia. Two out of every three hectares of drylands suffer from land degradation of one kind or another. Barring 78 M ha which are irreversibly degraded, the remainder area -affected by desertification -is reclaimable at a price. Desertification is caused primarily by over-exploitation of natural resources beyond their carrying capacity. Solutions to combat desertification lie in the management of the causes of desertification. However, there are no easy options to combat it. While managing demographic pressure should receive priority, the solutions to combat desertification involve local action, guided by land use and climatic conditions and in harmony with local needs and people’s expectations. Drylands are used as rangelands or as croplands, with the latter either irrigated or rainfed. Integrated data on land and soil degradation and on the socio-economic environment within which it occurs are the basis to formulate strategies for reclamation and proper use of drylands. Rangelands constitute the dominant land use (est. 88%) in the territories susceptible to desertification. Of the 3333 M ha rangeland area affected by land degradation 757 M ha are severely affected., 72 M ha irreversibly. Within rangelands, vegetation degradation is the primary cause of desertification –it represents 72% of the total area desertified worldwide (2576 M ha out of 3592 M ha). Overgrazing by excessive numbers of low productivity livestock and fuel wood extraction by man are the principal causes of vegetation degradation. Centralized management of common rangeland resources and insecure tenancy laws stand in the way of communities and herders adopting a long-term view to conserve and invest in range improvement measures. Inadequate dissemination of knowledge on vegetation improvement methods is another cause of rangeland degradation. Five suggestions are made to assure sustainability and effectiveness of rangeland management programs: (1) shifting to community management of rangelands that have been nationalized, (2) granting formal rights to individual transhumance herders that have been settled, (3) providing education and training on range management and improvement, (4) introducing elite breeds of livestock for high productivity, (5) implementing programs for harnessing alternative sources of energy for cooking (solar and biogas).Rainfed croplands occupy an area of 457 M ha, 216 M ha of which have degraded soils. Some 4 M ha suffer from irreversible degradation. Of the remainder, 29 M ha and 183 M ha are, respectively, affected by severe (reclaimable with engineering works) and moderate degradation. Soil constraints in rainfed croplands arise primarily from their vulnerability to erosion, which leads to loss of organic matter, fertility and rooting depth. Eroded soils are structurally unstable and are prone to crusting and compaction. Risk arising from drought susceptibility and poverty limit the adoption of restorative management. Rainwater conservation to minimize risk is not adopted due to insecure tenancy and centralized management of government supported programs. A lack of adequate knowledge and skills of efficient use and storage of rainwater allow degradation processes to proceed unchecked. The imperatives to succeed are: (1) land tenure policies towards freehold ownership; (2) community participation in the management of rainwater, (3) efficient use of harvested water supported by high value land use options built on indigenous knowledge and (4) government support to facilitate the development of rainfed agriculture. Irrigated croplands occupy an area of 145 M ha. Of this, 2 M ha are affected by irreversible degradation and 41 Mha suffer from reversible degradation, mainly from salinity and waterlogging. The mechanisms of salinity development differ and so do the solutions when canal or underground water is used for irrigation. With canal water irrigation, three key development options are suggested to remove excess salts and water and to minimize conveyance and application losses of water: (1) effective drainage, (2) properly lined or closed water conveyance systems and efficient irrigation techniques, and (3) participatory management of irrigation systems. The costs of installing drainage and leak-proof conveyance systems are high, but so are the economic and ecological gains. With underground water use, salinity develops as the water reserves are depleted due to over-extraction. While efficient methods of irrigation can help in postponing the occurrence of salinity, sustainable solutions lie in balancing the water withdrawals with recharge. Efforts should therefore be made to promote groundwater replenishment through runoff harvesting. Although it is not always possible to recharge the deep aquifers with the limited quantities of runoff produced by the low annual precipitation, still, the use of harvested runoff for irrigation can save groundwater. Once water-efficient systems are operational, cropping systems that maximize productivity per unit of water can be introduced. The entire strategy of reclaiming desertified land revolves around water, the reestablishment of the vegetation of rangelands, the rejuvenation of the productivity of rainfed croplands, and the halting of loss of irrigated farmlands. Humans play a central role in that strategy; desertification begins and ends with human action. Unless it ends, the estimated 900 million people affected today will grow to billions tomorrow.

N2  - Reservoirs are increasingly deemed to be important given their potential control of water availability across seasons - from wet to dry seasons, especially given the concerns on the effect of climate change. In this paper, we focus on the collective action aspect of investing in irrigation reservoirs and on the potential scope for policy intervention. We formulate a model in which farmers pool resources to construct a collective reservoir. We conceptualized the reservoir as a blue club that increases the potential water availability in dry season, thus improving water safety for the whole society. We determine the societal potential inefficiency in club size and the potential policy measures to correct it, focusing on two different club access rules (open vs closed membership). Results show that linear subsidy are ineffective in case of closed membership, and minimum participation rules are required.

N2  - Climate change is an established fact and its impacts on water, agriculture, health, biodiversity, forest and socio-economic sectors are quite visible around the globe. By virtue of its geographical location, Pakistan is highly vulnerable to the consequent climate change because of global warming. Adaptation to climate change and building resilience among ecosystems and people to respond to climate variability and hazard threats are relatively new concepts. Rice-wheat cropping system zone is the bread basket of Punjab, Pakistan and comprising more than 1 million farm families. There is an urgent need for improved climate modeling and forecasting that can provide a basis for informed decision-making and the implementation of adaptation strategies. For this study crop growth models (DSSAT and APSIM) were calibrated and evaluated on experimental field data to develop the robust genetic coefficients. Models were validated using farmers’ field data. Survey data for rice and wheat in Rice-wheat cropping zone of Punjab were collected for this study. An extensive farm survey for 155 farms from the selected five districts Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, HafizAbad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot was conducted. Surveyed data (initial condition, crop management, soil characteristic) were used to create the input files in both DSSAT and APSIM. The past climate of the study region, baseline (1981–2010) was analyzed by using the available weather station data and future climate projection were generated by General Circulation Models (GCMs) for mid-century (2040-2069) under RCP 8.5. Five GCMs (CCSM4, GFDLESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-MR) were used for the generation of climate projections. Trade of Analysis model for Multidimensional (TOA-MD) was used for economic analysis. Results of climate change scenarios showed that there would be mean 2.8 °C rise in maximum and 2.2 31 °C in minimum temperature for mid-century (2040-2069) in Rice-wheat (RW) cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan. In Rice average yield reduction in DSSAT and APSIM was 15.2% and 17.2% while in Wheat average yield reduction by DSSAT and APSIM was 14.1% and 12% during mid-century (2040-2069). A close agreement was observed between farmer and simulated fine rice yield with good statistical indices such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 409 kg ha-1 and 440 kg ha-1 with d-index (0.80 and 0.78) for DSSAT and APSIM models, respectively. Economic loss of 83% farm household, if they continue to use current production technology in changed climate. Adaptation strategies using Representative Concentration Pathways (RAP’s) were developed to achieve high productivity and meet the need of growing population, it would be required to increase the planting density, fertilizer use and reduce the irrigation amount up to 15% over current with greater potential for promising cultivars. This suggested that due to projected rise in temperature, the cropping seasons will be affected and 5 days earlier transplanting of rice nursery and two weeks earlier in wheat planting over current would be recommended. These strategies have a significant impact in reducing the vulnerabilities of the changing climate with 33% improvement in rice yield to sustain production in Rice-wheat cropping system. Significant reduction in poverty (5-6%) among farm households, if adaptation takes place in this zone

N2  - This paper investigates the patterns and determinants of change in livelihood
strategies (“development pathways”), land management practices, agricultural
productivity, resource and human welfare conditions in Uganda since 1990, based upon a
community-level survey conducted in 107 villages. The pattern of agricultural
development since 1990 involved increasing specialization and commercialization of
economic activities, consistent with local comparative advantages and market
liberalization. This pattern was associated with changes in land use and agricultural
practices, including expansion of cultivated area, grazing lands and woodlots at the
expense of forest and wetlands; increased ownership of cattle but declining ownership of
other livestock; and increased adoption of purchased inputs (though still low) and some
soil and water conservation practices. Despite some agricultural intensification, crop
yields, food security, and a wide range of natural resource conditions (especially soil
fertility) appear to have degraded throughout most of Uganda. At the same time, many
indicators of human welfare and access to goods and services have improved.
Six dominant development pathways emerged, all but one of which involved
increasing specialization in already dominant activities: expansion of cereal production,
expansion of banana and coffee production, non-farm development, expansion of
horticultural production, expansion of cotton, and stable coffee production. Of these,
expansion of banana and coffee production was most strongly associated with adoption of
resource-conserving practices and improvements in resource conditions, productivity and
welfare. Other strategies are needed for less- favored areas not suited for this pathway.
Road development appears to have contributed to improvements in many welfare
and some natural resource conditions, except forest and wetland availability. There are
thus likely trade-offs among resource and welfare outcomes when pursuing road
development where forests or wetlands are important. Elsewhere, road development can
be a “win-win” development strategy. Irrigation was found to reduce pressure to expand
cultivated area at the expense of forest, wetland and fallow, and is associated with
improvement in several welfare and resource indicators; it may also be a “win-win”
strategy. Government and non-governmental organization programs were also found to
contribute to improvements in several indicators of productivity, resource and welfare,
though there were some mixed results. Such programs may cause declines in one area
(e.g., yields of a traditional crop or energy availability) by focusing on improvements in
another area (e.g., improvement of another crop or protection of forests). Thus, trade-offs
appear to be inherent in many efforts to improve agriculture or protect resources. Population growth had an insignificant impact on most indicators of change, though there
is some evidence of population- induced agricultural intensification. Population growth
had an insignificant association with changes in resource conditions, and mixed
association with welfare indicators. In general, the findings support neither the
pessimism of some neo-Malthusian observers or the optimism of some neo-Boserupian
observers regarding the impacts of population growth.

N2  - Mit der Wasserrahmenrichtlinie hat die EU einen
juristischen Rahmen geschaffen, alle aquatischen
Ökosysteme zu schützen. Diese vornehmlich auf den
Grundwasserschutz abzielende Maßnahme kann zu
wirtschaftlichen Nachteilen für Landwirte führen. So
wird die Feldberegnung als Möglichkeit genutzt, den
ökonomischen Erfolg landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe zu
verbessern. Gleichzeitig wird ihr eine wichtige Rolle
als Risikomanagementinstrument zugestanden. In
diesem Beitrag werden unter Anwendung eines erweiterten
gesamtbetrieblichen Risikoprogrammierungsansatzes
die Auswirkungen einer Reduzierung der
Wasserentnahmeerlaubnisse unter Berücksichtigung
der Risikoakzeptanz des Entscheiders analysiert. Dabei
wird ein typischer Betrieb in Nordost-Niedersachsen
betrachtet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die
ökonomischen Nachteile der Beschränkung der Wasserentnahmeerlaubnisse
für den untersuchten Betrieb
überproportional mit der Reglementierung ansteigen
und bislang vielfach verwendete deterministische Bewertungsansätze
diese Nachteile systematisch unterschätzen. The European Union has established the Water
Framework Directive (WFD) as a legal framework to
protect all aquatic ecological systems including
groundwater. This directive is primarily aiming at
water protection and may have advantages for the
water regime in sensitive areas. Nevertheless, it may
also involve economic disadvantages for agricultural
enterprises. In this paper we analyze the economic implications of the WFD for farmers using irrigation,
i.e., the negative economic consequences for farms
resulting from a reduction of water withdrawal permits
in the north-east of Lower Saxony. In a whole
farm risk programming approach we show how much
benefit farmers loose if the amount of water withdrawal
permits is reduced. To avoid solutions that
would possibly exceed the farmers’ risk tolerance, the
apparently accepted standard deviation of the program’s
total gross margin is used as an upper bound
in the optimization. This should represent an observable
reflection of the individual risk attitude of the
farmers. The results demonstrate that deterministic
approaches do not consider all economic impacts
caused by the reduction of water withdrawal permits
as well as that risk has to be considered.

N2  - The issues being addressed in this paper are as follows. Has there been significant change in cost of
groundwater pumping due to diesel price shock in regions where it matters? If so, how that has impacted millions of
irrigation water buyers? How farmers respond to increase in irrigation costs? Such responses include: how the well
owning farmers change their farming enterprise, including the farming system itself; how their willingness to take risk
changes, and finally, how the economic prospects of irrigated farming itself changes as a result?
It is found that the impact of diesel price on irrigation cost incurred by diesel well owners is not significant.
One reason for this is that the regions which are heavily dependent on diesel pumps for irrigation have shallow
groundwater table. Also, this burden is not passed on to the water buyers owing to increasing competition and
reducing monopoly power of pump owners. The analysis of the farming enterprise of irrigators under differential cost
(irrigation) regimes presented here shows that farmers would be able to cope with very high rise in irrigation costs
through irrigation efficiency improvements and allocating more area under crops that give higher returns per unit of
land and water, that enhance the farming returns from every unit of water and energy used. By doing this, they are able
to maintain almost the same net returns from farming as in the past. This means, that the rise in cost of diesel in real
terms had not made any negative impact on economic prospects of diesel well irrigators, including water buyers.

N2  - This paper expounds the great significance of irrigation and water conservancy for the agricultural development. Vigorously developing irrigation and water conservancy can promote high yield and stable yield of grain, effectively increase farmers' income, alleviate the impact of drought on agricultural production, be conducive to the adjustment of agricultural production structure, and promote county economic development. The difficulties of developing irrigation and water conservancy in new era are analyzed as follows: the subject of liabilities defaults seriously: it lacks effective input security system; the quality of project degenerates badly; the agricultural technological development is slow Corresponding policy suggestions are put forward as follows: make the input subject of irrigation and water conservancy clear; form stable investment channels; strengthen the organizing and guiding functions of grass-roots government; reinforce the coordination and management of capital ; strengthen the promotion of agricultural technology; quicken the pace of reform of irrigation and water conservancy.

N1  - Presented at the 20th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, West Lafayette, IN, USA
N2  - In 2013, Mozambique’s government proposed a five-year agricultural investment plan that raised spending and targeted new investment areas, including fertilizer subsidies and agricultural research and extension. Evaluating sector-wide strategies is difficult since they comprise multiple interventions with spillovers. Numerous ex post studies evaluate specific investments, but the time-series or spatial data needed to estimate sector-wide returns is often lacking. Moreover, when new interventions are planned, there is no historical evidence on which to base analysis. To overcome these limitations, we develop a mixed-methods approach to evaluating the distributional effects of Mozambique’s investment plan – one that combines ex post analysis of specific investments with ex ante analysis of investment portfolios. We econometrically estimate investment impacts on farmer productivity, and then use these results to calibrate investment functions in a spatially-disaggregated CGE model. This permits experimentation with different levels and compositions of investments to evaluate how outcomes are improved. Econometric results (using propensity score matching) indicate farmers who use irrigation, receive extension advice, or use chemical fertilizers, have higher productivity. CGE analysis finds that the plan’s benefit-cost ratio and poverty impacts justify implementation. However, returns are much larger if resources are reallocated to research and extension and away from the current emphasis on irrigation. Greater spending on fertilizer subsidies also improves outcomes, but to a lesser extent. These findings are robust to a range of assumptions about investment costs and efficiency. We conclude that research and extension should be afforded a greater role in Mozambican investment plans. Our mixed-methods approach also greatly enhances the usefulness of ex post evaluation studies for sector-wide planning.

N2  - Smallholder irrigation schemes potentially improve the livelihoods of rural communities in developing countries. However, they face challenges such as infrastructural decline, lack of funding, lack of markets, shortage of water, underutilization of land, and inefficient irrigation systems. In Zimbabwe, the government carried out rehabilitation programs to address these problems but the performance of smallholder irrigation schemes remained poor. These chronic challenges triggered experts to adopt a market systems approach (MSA) to revitalize failing irrigation schemes. Using primary and secondary data sources collected in 2015, this study used a “before” and “after” descriptive assessment approach to determine the effectiveness of the MSA at revitalizing smallholder irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe. We used Mutema Irrigation Scheme as a case study. Results suggest that the MSA leads to improved efficiency of irrigation infrastructure, farm gross margins, willingness to pay irrigation fees and farmers’ standard of living. While this research does not econometrically establish causation of relations between variables involved, our results provide a foundation for future research on the application of the MSA to revitalize underperforming smallholder irrigation schemes in developing countries.

Impact of irrigation on poverty and environment in Ethiopia: draft proceedings of the symposium and exhibition, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 27-29 November 2007. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - The study examined the extent and nature of market oriented production in irrigated compared to rainfed systems in Ethiopia. By doing so the paper identifies the role of irrigation in market-oriented production, while at the same time highlighting the main constraints to market oriented development. Our results indicate that irrigation contributes significantly to increases in market participation, volume of marketed produce and, hence, income, by inducing shifts in farmers’ cropping mix. The impact of commercialization of production on household food security is not direct and immediate mainly because of failures in the food market. While irrigation enhances market production, there are series of factors that pose serious constraints to market production. Land size, oxen holding, access to market and means of transport were found to be important determinants of market oriented production calling for policy interventions in land markets, access to productive assets and infrastructure development and policy measures to improve the performance of agricultural markets. The study also found education has market promoting effect in terms of increasing the probability of participation and volume of sale. Increased support to education can, thus, help in the long-term to transform traditional subsistence agriculture into more market-oriented agriculture. Finally there are unobserved site specific effects, related to location and other covariates, which influence market participation and volume decisions.

N2  - Policies that encourage the use of more efficiency irrigation technology are often viewed as effective, politically feasible methods to reduce the consumptive use of water for agricultural production. Despite their widespread use, these policies have not been subject to empirical evaluation. In this article, we evaluate the effect on groundwater extraction of a widespread conversion from traditional center pivot irrigation systems to higher efficiency dropped-nozzle center pivot systems that has occurred in western Kansas. State and national cost-share programs subsidized the conversion. We find that the programs have not had the intended effect; the shift to more efficient irrigation technology has not decreased the amount of water applied to a given crop, and has actually increased groundwater extraction through changing cropping patterns.

N2  - The northern Australian beef industry accounts for approximately half of the national beef
herd. It is currently challenged by a range of factors including decline in beef prices, limited
live export trade, large farm debt levels, and low return on assets managed. Access to
irrigation has been identified as one factor with potential to contribute to growth of the
northern Australian beef industry. The development of irrigation for growing pasture and
forage crops could extend the ability to sustain cattle through the dry season, a period when
forage quality and quantity often limits cattle performance. We used a bio-economic model
(Northern Australia Beef Systems Analyser) to investigate the farm-scale impacts of
integrating forage crops into an existing cattle breeding operation in the Gilbert catchment of
north Queensland. We assessed the feasibility of a range of forage crop types and irrigated
areas with consideration of the capital costs of irrigation investment, price movements, and
water reliability. This analysis highlights some of the key conditions under which beef
producers are likely to benefit from an irrigation development at the farm scale.

N2  - In Niger, an important objective of the agricultural policy consists in promoting the development of small irrigation infrastructures in order to diversify agricultural production, extend the cropping season, raise land productivity and secure farmers' revenue. Small irrigation infrastructures are regarded as a possible alternative to large irrigation infrastructure since they are cheaper to implement and maintain and easier to manage. This paper attempts to explore the impacts of a program of small irrigation development in Niger on land allocation, agricultural production and income generation using the farm-level model FSSIM-Dev (Farm System Simulator for Developing Economies) and data from a nationally representative sample of farm households. FSSIM-Dev, a static positive programming model, was applied to every individual farm household included in sample to capture the full heterogeneity of impacts across farm households. Results show the large potential impact of small irrigation on agriculture production and income generation, especially during the dry season and in regions of Niger with high potential irrigable land. Farm income would increase by around 7 % at country level if small irrigation was made available to all farmers. Small irrigation infrastructure would also contribute the reduction of income inequality.

N2  - Paddy- Bihar's staple crop- is vulnerable to droughts, primarily due to high cost of irrigation. In 2008, Bihar government launched a conditional cash transfer scheme to subsidise diesel for irrigation in drought affected areas. We show that this scheme has not been effective in mitigating the impact of drought on paddy production. A primary survey of potential and actual beneficiaries shows that low awareness and penetration among smallholders, alongside uncertainties and delays in the discursal of the subsidy, make it ineffective. We suggest that in states with limited capacity, such ad-hoc subsidies are unlickely to protect smallholders from weather shocks.

N2  - Natural causes (such as droughts), non-natural causes (such as competing uses), and government policies limit the supply of water for agriculture in general and irrigating crops in particular. Under such reduced water supply scenarios, existing physical models reduce irrigation proportionally among crops in the farmer’s portfolio, disregarding temporal changes in economic and/or institutional conditions. Hence, changes in crop mix resulting from expectations
about risks and returns are ignored. A method is developed that considers those changes and
accounts for economic substitution and expansion effects. Forecasting studies based on this method with surface water in Georgia and Alabama demonstrate the relative strength of econometric modeling vis-a`-vis physical methods. Results from a study using this method for ground water in Mississippi verify the robustness of those findings. Results from policy induced simulation scenarios indicate water savings of 12% to 27% using the innovative method developed. Although better irrigation water demand forecasting in crop production was the key objective of this pilot project, conservation of a valuable natural resource (water) has turned out to be a key consequence.

N1  - Presented at the 18th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Melbourne, Australia
N2  - The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of irrigation water pricing on the New Zealand economy using a modified version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and database. The primary user of irrigation water in NZ is dairy, and since 95 percent of NZ dairy production is exported, analysis using a global general equilibrium model will contribute important insights. While use of a global model brings significant benefits, a shortcoming of using GTAP for country-level analysis for analysis of issues such as water is the lack of regional specification within the country. Since regions of a country like New Zealand vary substantially in terms of what they produce and how much irrigated water is used, the impacts on different regions within the country may differ greatly. For example, the Auckland Region is the commercial capital, producing over a third of country’s economic output, yet it produces only 2% of NZ dairy. To overcome this limitation, NZ is split into 15 regions. In the absence of the availability of detailed input-output data for regions within New Zealand, we use regional product as weights when undertaking the regional splits. To examine the effects of irrigation water pricing, the GTAP model is further modified by splitting the land endowment into irrigated and non-irrigated for each newly region. This, again, is highly unevenly distributed: the Waikato Region is the largest single dairy producing region in the country (producing 24 percent of all dairy), but it includes less than 3 percent of all irrigated land in NZ. By contrast, the Canterbury Region comprises over 60 percent of all irrigated land in New Zealand, but produces only 18 percent of the country’s dairy output. This model modification follows the approach of Calzadilla et al (2011) as used in the creation of the GTAP-Water (GTAP-W) model, however, in our work this is only implemented for the newly created sub-regions of New Zealand rather than for the whole world. This approach allows in-depth analysis of the impact of freshwater management policies in New Zealand that will affect the price of water with particularly important outcomes for the dairy industry, including on exports to international markets.

N2  - Agricultural areas can be significantly impacted by high-value crops. Irrigated potato production has significantly affected central North Dakota. Interested growers in the Jamestown area recognized the need and the potential for irrigated potato production and processing, and eventually convinced a private company to build a processing plant to make frozen potato products from their irrigated potatoes. Securing a private entity to process their product freed up capital for irrigation development and other potato enterprise purchases. Economic impacts resulting from the addition of irrigated potatoes and associated processing were analyzed in this study. This analysis is divided into two parts, construction/start-up (one-time) and operational (on-going) impacts. Construction/start-up phase includes plant construction, purchases of irrigation equipment, farmer purchases of potato machinery, and grower spending for potato storage facilities. The operational-phase includes processing plant expenditures and grower production expenditures net of the most likely non-irrigated crop.

Direct expenditures for the construction/start-up phase were over $50 million for the 1995-96 period. This was comprised of $10.5 million for plant construction, $23.1 million for irrigation equipment, $3.4 million for potato grower machinery, and $13.0 million for grower potato storage facilities. Annual operational-phase direct expenditures were over $55 million, with the processing plant expenditures being $33.4 million and grower production outlays at $22.0 million. These direct expenditures were applied to the North Dakota Input-Output model to determine the economic impact of this project.

Construction/start-up phase economic impact was estimated to be nearly $28 million in added personal income, over $44 million in new retail sales, and a total gross business volume of $115 million. Annual impacts from the operational phase included a personal income increase of nearly $48 million, increased retail sales of almost $48 million, and total business activity of $148 million. Increased tax collections to the state were estimated to total $2.7 million during the construction/start-up phase and $3.1 million annually during the operational phase. This economic development activity resulted in a peak of 260 plant construction jobs and a permanent plant work force of 250 full-time equivalents. In addition, operational-phase secondary employment was estimated to be 1,569 full-time equivalent workers.

N2  - An economic optimization model for a sixty years planning horizon is developed using available groundwater resources in the Texas Panhandle. Net present value and total water use over 60 years is used to estimate the value of water for irrigated agriculture in the area. The decline of the Ogallala Aquifer, which is the primary source of irrigation water for the Texas Panhandle, due to excessive extraction rates poses questions about the economic, social and political future of the area. 
Economic optimization models for each of the 23 counties in the Texas Panhandle are developed with a goal of maximizing the net income from crop production. Nine major crops are selected. Results from the 60-year analysis for the 23 counties indicate a significant transition from irrigated agriculture to dryland farming. Total irrigated crop acres in the study area decrease by approximately 83 percent from 1.79 million acres to 0.30 million acres while total dryland crop acres increase by about 125 percent from 1.20 million acres to 2.69 million acres. Total groundwater use in the study area significantly declines for the planning horizon by 71 percent from 2.16 million ac-ft to 0.63 million ac-ft. The average saturated thickness of the Ogallala Aquifer in the 23 counties shows a 21 percent decline over the planning period.
The model will serve as a policy tool to analyze alternative water management strategies and water conservation programs that can possibly be implemented in the area. The results from the model will also be used to assess the socio-economic impacts of depleting groundwater availability from the Ogallala Aquifer in the region.

N2  - Water is an important input in most economic sectors hence necessary for economic development. However, water scarcity is on the increase due to human population growth, expansion of cities and rise in demand for water in agriculture and other sectors. Water utilization is highest in agriculture compared to other sectors of the economy. The most significant problem in agriculture is the intense use and low efficiency of water. To reduce the inefficiency and intense use, water must be treated as an economic good and more efficient prices be introduced. This requires estimation of the economic value of water and assessment of factors affecting farmers Willingness to Pay (WTP) for irrigation water.
The purpose of the study was to estimate the economic value of irrigation water in Ahero Irrigation Scheme. The specific objectives were: to estimate the economic value of irrigation water among smallholder rice farmers in Ahero Irrigation Scheme; to assess the factors influencing farmers‟ WTP for irrigation water in Ahero Irrigation Scheme; to determine whether irrigation water is a significant input in rice production in Ahero Irrigation Scheme.
Both Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and Residual Value Method (RVM) were used to estimate the economic value of irrigation water while the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) was used to assess the factors influencing farmers‟ WTP for irrigation water. A production function was estimated to determine which factors influence rice output and whether water is a significant input in rice production. CVM was found to undervalue irrigation water, hence the economic value of irrigation water was estimated to be Ksh.7.54/m3, based on the RVM results. Participation in off-farm income generating activities, access to credit and satisfaction with the management of water supply positively influence farmers‟ WTP for irrigation water at 1%, 10% and 1% levels of significance respectively. Volume of irrigation water was significant at 10%
xii
level in determining rice yields in Ahero Irrigation Scheme, Nyando District, Kenya. Quantity of fertilizer and labour were also found to influence rice output positively at 10% level.
Irrigation water at Ahero Irrigation Scheme should be charged at appropriate price relative to its economic value of Ksh.7.54/m3 to avoid its wasteful use. The findings of this study further reveal that irrigation water is a significant input in rice production and therefore its supply and management should be improved to ensure adequate amount of water during rice production periods. Smallholder farmers should also be encouraged to take credit and participate in Small and Medium Enterprises in order to improve off-farm income which consequently increases their WTP for irrigation water.

climate change on farm structure and adaptation thereof. The future sustainability of
the agricultural sector relies on the type of adaptation strategy put in place for
farmers to cope with the projected impacts of climate change. The Ceres Dynamic
Integrated Model (CDIM) was developed to evaluate different adaptation strategies,
results show that it is unlikely that high water tariffs will reduce the level of water
used for production. Depending on the availability of funds to make farm dams
available for farmers, access to farm dam capacity and winter water allocations as
well as increasing water use efficiency are potential adaptation options for the
farmers. Improved water management practices that increase the productivity of
irrigation water use may provide a significant adaptation potential under future
climate.

Based on a probit model, the farm size, land fragmentation, access to electricity, and access to credit were found to significantly influence farmers’ decisions to own STWs. Although the water market benefited poor farmers, it is too small and monopolistic. Policy reforms needed to make groundwater accessible to the poor majority include effective credit programs, investments in rural electrification, and public sector support for promoting suitable pumping technologies

N2  - The economics of production and factors influencing the productivity of
green peas in Punjab have been studied using the primary data from pea
growers. The data have been analysed using simple tabular and functional
analyses. The results have revealed that the green peas and wheat are the
main crops in rabi season. It has been noticed that 75.85 per cent of the
farmers purchase pea seeds from dealers. The yield of green peas has
been found the highest on small farms among all the farm-size categories.
The total cost incurred has been higher in large than small and medium
farmers due to more use of inputs by the former. The gross and net returns
have been found higher in large than small and medium farmers due to
realization of higher prices by them and exploring of other markets due to
their higher marketable surpluses. The functional analysis has revealed
that the fertilizers, irrigation and machinery are the impact variables,
influencing the productivity of green peas positively. The returns over
variable costs in the case of peas have been higher by 129 per cent than
those in wheat (main competing crop). It has been argued that the farmers
be advised by the agricultural extension experts to adopt green pea
cultivation for improving the efficiency of the farms through increased
income per unit of land. Moreover, it will provide impetus to the
diversification program of the state government and improve the soil health.

N2  - Water resources are facing several stresses in terms of quantity and quality. These pressures are closely related to the human interventions in fields like: agriculture, land-use/land use change, and pollutant emissions, among others. Within this context, the expected changes in climate pattern will exacerbate the challenges faced by water resources. Considering the critical role that water plays for agricultural production, any shock in water availability will have great implications for agricultural production, and through agricultural markets these impacts will reach the whole economy with economy-wide consequences. In this paper a new modeling approach is developed aiming to include water explicitly within the ICES CGE model. In order to reach this objective a new database was built considering explicitly the water endowment, precipitation changes, and unitary irrigation costs. The results suggest different economic consequences of climate change on depending on the specific country. The impacts are related to change in crop production, endowment demands, and international trade.

N2  - Water projects are typically evaluated using benefit cost analysis. Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. Many of these benefits are ignored in benefit cost analysis, because of the absence of markets and the limited information or understanding of how the benefits from ecosystem services are produced. Regional or local government may be interested in learning how the value of ecosystem services associated with projects may change if a project occurs. Ecosystem Service Reviews aim to make ecosystem services explicit and quantifiable so that they can be accounted for in the evaluation of water use projects. Water storage projects can enable land use intensification to occur, and confer environmental benefits in some instances (e.g., flow augmentation) and costs in others (e.g., groundwater contamination and flow‐on effects). Water storage projects can have both positive and negative outcomes for the environment. More flow can lead led to better fishing, better clarity, more contaminant dilution and a healthier aquatic ecosystem. It can also result in loss of braided river‐bird habitat, and regulated flows can result in nuisance growths of potentially toxic algal species. Irrigation can increase productivity of land within the scheme, with attendant benefits to soil quality and other out‐of‐river environmental characteristics. This paper reports the methods used to assess the impact of a water storage dam on the flow of ecosystem services in a river system. We review the range of ecosystem services that are available in a river system and examine how the flow of ecosystem services can be altered by water storage and flow augmentation through the construction of a dam. In order to list and quantify ecosystem services an attempt is made to determine a suitable site specific set of ecosystem service indicators for the Opuha‐Opihi river system case. We draw inferences about shifts in the value of ecosystem services that might arise from water projects in other contexts.

N2  - The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) is a comprehensive way to study agricultural issues. So far, to our best knowledge, no study has applied the SLF to examine the influence of land quality on land use intensively. The current research examines the effects of land quality on farmers’ decision-making on land use in Vietnam by modifying the sustainable livelihoods framework and using the fixed effects regression model. The method controlled the household and commune-level unobserved invariant characteristics and resulted in more robust estimates than pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation. The sample is a five-wave panel dataset of 2008-2016 with 1,534 farm households. The results reveal that land quality affects land-use choices through several aspects of land quality. More specifically, regarding topography, plot fertility level, plot locations, and soil and water conservation, results show that their effects reflect the cultivating practices for each land-use type in the sample. Findings also show that the irrigation system positively affects rice production in Vietnam. Policymakers should consider various aspects of land quality when designing policies and programs relating to land use, irrigation distribution, and especially the master plan for agricultural production and rural development. Flexible guidance for land uses of each type is closely connected with land quality in each region that may be most suitable for sustainable agriculture development.

Impact of irrigation on poverty and environment in Ethiopia: draft proceedings of the symposium and exhibition, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 27-29 November 2007. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - This article presents the finding of a study undertaken to assess the status-quo and significant environmental impacts of two selected large-scale irrigation on natural resources in Ethiopia. Main focus is on the environmental impacts of irrigation on natural resources with special emphasis on soil quality, water quality and downstream impacts, hydrology and potential interference with ecosystems. For this purpose two schemes were selected. Wonji/Shoa Sugar Plantation is located in the Upper Awash Basin and Finchaa Valley Sugar Estate located in the Blue Nile Basin. It is well known that irrigation projects can have several adverse environmental impacts that may threaten the sustainable production of agricultural goods, which is of major importance and interest in Ethiopia since it contributes 44 percent to Ethiopia’s GDP, employs 80 percent of the labor force, and provides a livelihood to 85 percent of the nearly 80 million population (Awulachew, 2006, Government of Ethiopia, 2006, UNDP, 2006). Irrigation projects inter alia can have potential impacts on the hydrological characteristics of aquifers, quality of downstream water bodies, quality of soils and ecosystems. The most prominent results and environmental impacts of the selected case study sites could be summarized as follows. In general the irrigation water is of good quality, but the electric conductivity is unfavorable to the adjusted sodium ratio, which leads in some instances to soil crusting and has a negative impact on infiltration rate. In Wonji/Shoa the groundwater table has risen due to improper irrigation management and seepage of reservoirs. In Fincha a valuable ecosystem has been destroyed due to the establishment of the scheme and increased migration.

N2  - This study estimates the likely impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic when combined with environmental stressors. We identify the conditions under which a combination of economic recession and drought conditions leads to intensified food insecurity. We also identify which regions are more influenced by other regions through changes in other parts of the world. We integrate SIMPLE (Simplified International Model of agricultural Prices, Land use, and the Environment) with WBM (Water Balance Model). The WBM projections show changes in the hydrological supply of water resources and agronomic demand for water. The SIMPLE model provides agricultural production, food security, and caloric nutrition outcomes. It also determines the irrigation water demand around the world. The prices of crops, livestock, and processed food commodities are determined considering the international trade of agricultural products. In an interconnected world, water-scarce regions are expected to import water-intensive commodities from relatively water-abundant regions. However, the degree of scarcity depends on availability relative to demand. We consider the changes in water supply relative to the changes in water demand in case of water scarcity combined with the economic lockdown.

N1  - In this study, economic impact of water harvesting and groundwater recharging was analyzed in the
context of Sujala watershed equity and efficiency in the distribution of benefits in Chitradurga district, Karnataka.
Field data for 2004-05 (drought year) and 2005-06 (normal year) from 30 sample farmers in Sujala watershed
form the data base for the study. Another sample of 30 farmers from Non-Sujala (or DPAP) watershed, and 30
from outside watershed area form the control. Farmers were further classified as: (i) those who had bore well
irrigation; and (ii) those who had no borewell irrigation in order to assess the impact of watershed.
It was found that the amortized cost per functioning well and cost per acre inch of groundwater in
Sujala watershed is lower than that in non-Sujala watershed and non-watershed area. The economic contribution
in terms of incremental net returns per acre in (i) Sujala over non-watershed area (in drought year, normal year)
as the contribution of Sujala watershed are Rs. 1726 and Rs. 3650; (ii) Sujala over Non-Sujala (DPAP)
watershed (as the contribution of Sujala watershed institutions) is Rs. 1067 and Rs. 898); (iii) Non Sujala
(DPAP) over non-watershed area (equal to contribution to Non-Sujala or DPAP watershed) is Rs. 133 and Rs.
2226. These indicate economic supremacy of Sujala watershed program.
The incremental net returns of Sujala over non-watershed area in drought year and in normal year
for farmers possessing irrigation wells were Rs. 614 and Rs. 5056 respectively; for farmers not possessing
irrigation wells is Rs. 7354 and Rs. 5326; for all classes of farmers is Rs. 3066 and Rs. 4967 are the prima facie
indicators of economic contributions of Sujala watershed program. The negative externality per well per year in
Sujala was Rs 2652, in Non-Sujala watershed was Rs. 2735, and in non-watershed area was Rs. 4285. It shows
that the negative externality in groundwater irrigation has reduced by 38% in Sujala over non-watershed area.
Sujala watershed program had a higher expenditure as compared to non-sujala watershed. Still the B-C
ratios were higher in Sujala watershed during both drought and normal year.
N2  - The paper looks at the impact of water harvesting programs in ground water recharge through the case of the Sujala watershed in Karnataka. On comparison with areas of non sujala watershed and non watershed cases in one normal rainfall and one drought year, it was revealed that Sujala has been successful in recharging
groundwater, improving farmers’ incomes and increasing crop production. Further the program is inclusive and the benefits were accrued even to the small and marginal farmers. In fact the net return for small and marginal farmers was higher that that for large and medium farmers. The study concluded that there is potential for
expansion of Sujala pattern of watershed development program in other parts of Karnataka and India.

N2  - Irrigation equity leads to overall socio economic development in an irrigation project.
Uneven distribution of water among farmers caused social unsets as well as agriculture
migration. The situation becomes more acute when no scientific water distribution policy
adopted by the irrigation officials viz.warabandi (Roster system of water distribution as
per the owned landholding). The same case was studied in tribal dominated Jakham
irrigation project where more than 82.12 percent farmers were tribals. At tail end of
RMC, parel miner was selected purposely where most of the farmers were suffered from
scarcity of water. At the parel miner socio economic status further studied as head, middle
and tailend farmers. The farmers located at head of the miner were getting more water
comparatively to other but they were misutilised the water and not use water rationally.
Whereas middle farmers were getting water mordantly and tail enders suffered high
scarcity. The data revealed that the socio economic conditions in terms of cropping
pattern, cropping intensity, farm income, farm and family assets were better in case of
middle farmers followed by headrech and tailand farmers. The tail end farmers even left
the agriculture practices in such of gainful employment.

N2  - The equity issues concerning soil degradation and soil reclamation have
been analysed for Tungabhadra Project Area of the Karnataka state. The
study is based on primary data obtained from 325 respondent farmers. The
data gathered by survey method have been analysed using conventional
and simple tabular method of analysis, Gini ratio, and Lorenz curve. The
study has revealed that the small and marginal farmers are worst affected
by soil degradation. The large farmers have also experienced the brunt of
soil degradation but the effect has been marginal since they have alternative
sources of livelihood. The study has further indicated that the extent of
inequity is higher on degraded than normal soils. However, this can be
reduced to a great extent by launching land reclamation programmes.
Therefore, the study has suggested that the government should initiate
land reclamation programmes on a large scale on long-term basis so that
the fruits of land reclamation technologies could reach the vulnerable
sections of the society.

N2  - Este trabajo calcula el valor del regadío en la provincia de León a partir de datos de precios de la tierra desagregados por aprovechamiento y comarca. El valor de los beneficios asociados al regadío puede averiguarse comparando dos parcelas de tierra "iguales" excepto por el hecho de que una de las tierras sea de secano y la otra de regadío. La dificultad de encontrar estas parcelas de tierra iguales se soluciona acudiendo al análisis de regresión donde se analizan los efectos del regadío en el precio de la tierra tras controlar los efectos de las características que diferencian a las parcelas analizadas. Usando un modelo econométrico se calculan los precios medios de la tierra asociados a los aprovechamientos de secano y de regadío. La diferencia entre estos precios constituye una valoración del regadío. Los resultados del trabajo permiten valorar proyectos de regadío en función de la superficie de tierra que permitan regar.

Abstract:
In this paper, we estimate the value of irrigated land in the province of Leon (Spain) using land prices (irrigated and non irrigated) for two different uses (crop production and pasture) in ten different districts. The value of benefits associated with irrigation can be estimated by comparing the price of an irrigated plot of land with a similar plot of non irrigated land. The logical difficulty of finding these two similar (except for water) plots of land can be overcome using regression analysis where the effect of irrigation on land prices can be estimated after controlling for other differences in the plots of land analyzed. In the present paper, using an econometric model, we estimate the average prices associated with irrigated and non irrigated land. The difference among these average prices is an estimate of the value of irrigation. The results of this paper can be used in the analysis of new irrigation projects.

N2  - This paper uses an economic catchment model to assess changes in land use, enterprise distribution, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loading levels from a series of policies that introduce carbon prices or nutrient reduction caps on land-based production in the Hurunui Catchment in Canterbury, New Zealand. At $20/tCO2e, net revenue for the catchment is reduced by 7% from baseline levels while GHGs are reduced by 3%. At $40/ tCO2e, net revenue is reduced by 15% while GHGs are reduced by 21%. Nitrogen and phosphorous loading levels within the catchment were also reduced when landowners face a carbon price, thus providing other benefits to the environment. Additional scenarios in this paper assess the impacts from developing a large-scale irrigation project within the catchment. Results show that while adding irrigation can improve farm output and revenue, it also results in dramatically higher GHG emissions and nutrient loads. Placing a carbon price on land-based activities diminishes some of these pollutants, but not at the same rate as when the policy what enacted on the baseline irrigation levels. Finally, we investigate the impacts of imposing a nutrient loading cap on farm activities instead of a carbon price and find that if landowners had greater access to irrigation but were constrained to hold the nutrient loads at baseline levels, revenue could increase by 6% over the baseline while GHG emissions could be reduced by 5%. Our findings suggest that while there is a potentially a strong trade-off between water quantity and water quality in the Hurunui Catchment, imposing the right policy levers could reduce some of the environmental impacts from an increase in land-use intensity without placing a large economic or regulatory burden on its landowners.

N2  - Practical methods for the accurate estimation of water requirement for irrigated agriculture are essential. Simulation
model is a useful tool to estimate water balance in the crop field. In this study, the BUDGET model was used to
evaluate its performance to simulate water balance in wheat field. The BUDGET model is composed of a set of
validated subroutines describing the various processes involved in water extraction by plant roots and soil water
movement in absence of a water table. The model was run to simulate evapotranspiration values with the actual
observed weather, crop and soil data for three years (2002-2005), obtained from experimental Station of Bangladesh
Institute of Nuclear Agricultural (BINA). The input data of model are separated into four stages and the value of Kc
and root depth are different for each stage. Evaluation of model performance is done with both graphical display and
statistical criteria. The simulated values fall close to 1:1 line, indicating better performance. The statistical parameters
such as standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), coefficient of variation (CV) of simulated and actual
evapotranspiration values are found 21.07 and 29.23; 4.49 and 6.23; and 38.03 and 50.75, respectively. Both the
standard error and coefficient of variation for simulated values are found lower than the observed values indicating
stability of the model output. The coefficient of determination value (R2 =0.83) is high for this model, which indicates
good simulation performance. The relative error (RE) is 23.28 percent and model efficiency (EF) is 78.95 percent
which means that the simulation of actual evapotranspiration is satisfactory. The value of Index of agreement (IA) is
0.918 which indicates a very good performance of the model. The overall statistical parameters of simulation period
are in satisfactory level. Therefore, the BUDGET model is able to predict actual evapotranspiration for any level of
soil moisture with reasonable accuracy. The model can be used in planning, management and operation of an
irrigation project for judicious use of water with the limited inputs, especially suitable for countries where modeling of
crop yield is needed under water stress conditions.

N2  - Today, the processes of decentralization and democratization are fundamental aspects of sustainable human development in Mali, and have a considerable impact on all strategies and policies involved in agricultural development. The role and responsibilities of the state are limited to missions of protection and of public administration. Most activities related to economic management and development programs have been transferred to civil society and local populations.
The aims of the new Plan for Rural Land Development are to encourage greater flexibility and to make the related strategies and policies more consistent. Of particular interest are the following:
· National environmental protection policy
· Strategy for poverty reduction and accelerated growth
· National strategy for irrigation development
The institutions responsible for implementing these policies are handicapped by lack of skilled and experienced personnel, uncertainty, and financial constraints. All of these problems must be urgently dealt with. Inappropriate land law and weakened traditional management regimes also make it particularly difficult to solve the numerous land conflicts that arise. This problem poses a significant threat to attempts to establish sustainable natural resource management and land tenure security in irrigated areas. The authors assess these problems and recommend strategies for addressing them.

N2  - Major environmental indicators require data at a spatial resolution below administrative units as
found in economic models. The CAPRI-Dynaspat project added spatial results for EU27 to the CAPRI
model allowing for linkage to bio-physical models and calculation of novel indicators. The layer
consists of clusters of 1x1 km cells exhausting the agricultural area, uniform in soil parameters, slope
class, land cover and administrative unit. Crop and irrigation shares, stocking densities and yields are
estimated per cluster along with intermediate input demand including crop specific fertilizer
application rates. Those estimates drive statistically estimated meta-models from the bio-physical crop
growth model DNDC to derive the nitrogen and water cycle. Indicator calculators allow estimating
further impacts as e.g. different gaseous emissions or economic performance of agriculture. The
results are available for the base year, for projection or scenario results, thus allowing analyzing
environmental impacts in a spatial context.

N2  - Fodder is continuously cultivated in coastal area of Salalah and Batinah region of Sultanate of Oman. However, this created a negative impact on the overall agriculture system and producti­on. The government authority stopped the cultivation of Rhodes grass in coastal area and support farmers with incentive systems in order to increase fodder production investment at Najed area. Due to irrigation water policy regulations, new technical solutions required, underground water availability, fodder investors have little data to help in making investment decisions. In addition, fodder production investments are characterized by much uncertainty due to the nature of the desert farming which is relying on many factors that cannot be controlled. In this paper a dynamic evaluation model was formed and developed as a method of analyzing the economic feasibility of fodder cultivation investment project with regard to project profitability under risk environment. Economic feasibility of the investment is evaluated through calculation of the Net Present Value and IRR by using Monte Carlo Simulation models. Our objective is to formulate a dynamic programming simulation model for the investment decision with incorporating this uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. Our simulation model result shows that the dynamic models are able to help investors and policy makers in taking optimum investment decision. Taking the risk into account leads to a significant decrease of the economic attractiveness of stakeholders and more Government support is needed to achieve water policy objectives and project sustainability at new developed area at Najed.

These include; small water infrastructures, drip irrigation, organic matter recovery from waste, and treated wastewater. The design decisions relating to attribute selection, the level of attributes, alternatives and choice tasks were guided by literature, field visit, focus group discussions, experts input and an iterative process of STATA to generate an orthogonal main effects CE design. The data used was generated from a random sample of 300 farm households in the Dano and Ouagadougou municipalities in Burkina Faso. Results from conditional logit, latent class logit and mixt logit models show that farmers have positive and significant preferences for drip irrigation, treated waste water and organic matter. However, they are WTP on average, more for drip irrigation and organic matter for agricultural sustainability. In line with economic theory, the cost of an intervention reduces demand for a given intervention. These findings can provide policy makers with evidence for agricultural policy design to build farmers’ resilience in the Sahel.

N2  - This paper aims to estimate the causal impact of the unexpected weather variation on the employment level of the farm households by exploiting natural variation of the unexpected weather changes and variation in decision of labour allocation based on gender and occupation in Indonesia. 
Weather variability is increasing in frequency, duration and intensity. It cannot be predicted with certainty and effectively mitigated in terms of both the time of the event and the impact of the loss (Lei, Liu, et al. 2016). Through its implications for agricultural production, the weather variability together with extreme weather will lead to crop failure, increased production costs, damaged farm infrastructure, reduced farmer incomes, and increased rural poverty (Winsemius et al. 2018). Despite substantial discussion on crop diversification, the farmers’ option to manage their family labour as means of risk avoidance is limited in the literature (Ayenew 2017). It is a crucial question to address how this strategy is effective in response to the negative effect of unexpected weather changes. 
We exploit the unexpected weather variability that is defined as the deviation between the real-time value of weather condition, proxies by the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Then, we construct our model based on the assumption that farming family hold non-separable between production and consumption decision, as a response to market imperfection. To this end, our outcome variables refer to a household’s allocation of time to work (log household worked hours) of family labour to any of the categories of activities (in agriculture and non-agriculture) and by gender. While, our control variables comprise information on household and community characteristics. Household characteristics variables consist of farm or land size, parents education, household size, non-farm asset, the working-age (15-65 years old) member of the household. Village characteristics measure the availability of infrastructure that are the level of road and electricity, and irrigation. Information on altitude, experience to drought in the last year and majority income of village dwellers are also taking into account in our model. Hence, by utilising a linear household fixed-effect method, our model can be written as: 
y_ijt= 〖α+φD〗_jt+〖βX〗_ijt+〖ωV〗_jt+〖δ_i+δ_d+δ〗_t+ ε_ijt………(4) 
Overall, our results found that there were causal inferences between the employment level of farm households and weather-based variables. Unexpected variability of weather exposure reduced the number of working hours of farms employed by 4.7 per cent per standard deviation. In contrast, farm household’s member worked more in non-agricultural job as indicated by the number of working hours increased 3.6 per cent. These results are robust to the inclusion of sub-district and year fixed effect as control, and several confounding factors. Moreover, the panel regression confirmed that all policies variables have a significant positive on households working hours. Agricultural extension, public works project, and credit facilities in the villages are substantial consideration for the policies design to support farmers in overcoming the negative effect of weather variability.

N2  - The present research aims to trace the main historical references for agricultural subsidies, including fertilizers, in Mali. It gives an overview of the major historical dates that have influenced the use of fertilizer subsidies, to capitalize learnings and lessons learned from past experiences to improve current practices. The methodological approach is based on a review of the literature, use of available secondary data and interviews with key individuals who have worked on fertilizer use and distribution in Mali. The analysis of the results shows that the fertilizer subsidy has always been an integral part of the agricultural development strategies of the successive governments of the Republic of Mali from 1960 to 2019. Regardless of the adopted economic system (socialist or liberal) and the vicissitudes of history, the practice of fertilizer subsidies has never disappeared from the financing strategies of agriculture in Mali. In general, fertilizer subsidies have been perpetuated over time, sometimes reducing the constraints imposed by donors. Moreover, they have recently been justified by the need, on the one hand, to encourage the use of fertilizers to increase agricultural production and productivity in order to ensure food security and to protect farmers against the volatility of fertilizer prices, the adverse effects of droughts on crops and incomes, on the other hand. Thus, in the early years of independence, under the prevailing socialist economic system, large, uncontrolled fertilizer subsidies were allocated to rural development operations (ODRs). Their mismanagement has led to unsustainable debt for the state without a real impact on the living conditions of the people. For this reason, as part of structural adjustment policies, fertilizer subsidies have been discouraged or even eliminated for most agricultural sectors. But in the wake of the global food and nutrition crisis of 2007, they were rehabilitated and then put back on track to increase agricultural production and productivity. Currently, the fertilizer subsidy program implemented through paper and electronic technical delivery systems is becoming increasingly controlled to ensure traceability and transparency. However, the cost of this fertilizer subsidy program is increasing and the impact on beneficiary populations remains mixed. Hence the need to reconcile fertilizer subsidies with sustainable investment needs in agriculture, including through public investment (e.g., research and development, extension services and irrigation infrastructure).

N2  - Addressing irrigation water efficiency continues to emerge as one of the potential solutions to minimize irrigation water use, improve water quality, and enhance soil health. Despite the clear importance of financial information in decision making regarding adoption of irrigation tools, little information is available regarding the profitability outlook of such adoption. Lack of assessment of costs and returns could lead to producers resisting adoption citing profit reductions. Hence, a cost-assessment using the financial information is necessary to evaluate the tools’ economic outlook. By using long-term projections of input prices, crop yield, and crop prices, this paper develops a financial analysis of irrigation using surge valves by calculating annual cash flows and net present value. The analysis is based on demonstration plot results and anecdotal estimates related to water savings and yield improvements in corn and soybeans in northeast Louisiana. The positive estimates for net present value indicates that an investment in irrigation efficiency improvement is an economically sound choice. These estimates can enhance the adoption of irrigation efficiency improvement practices by providing an initial understanding of the overall profitability independent of short-term management decisions.

N2  - Irrigation water demand is estimated using field-level panel data from Kansas over 16 years.
The cost of pumping varies over time due to changes in energy prices and across space due
to differences in the depth to water. Exploiting this variation allows us to estimate the demand
elasticity while controlling for field-farmer and year fixed effects. Fixed effects also allow us to
control for land use without an instrument or assumptions about the distribution of errors. Our
estimates of water demand are used to calculate the cost of reducing irrigation water use through
water pricing, irrigation cessation, and intensity-reduction programs.

N2  - This paper aimed to determine the magnitude of food insecurity and its determinants in rural households of Tibet, China. In this paper, a community based cross-sectional study was conducted from 2002 to 2013, whole about Tibet (this survey program was founded by Tibet Government Founding). In the study, household heads were recruited using a multistage random sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) tool after verbal informed consent. We chosen the same districts, same household, collected data every two years, totally number of the households is 736. 
Based on the data of sample investigation, combined with individual anthropometric estimates for children and a thorough understanding of household behavior, we moved beyond the simple head count measure of food insecurity in this paper and proposed three measures of food insecurity, along the lines of new poverty measures and explained the desirable properties of these measures that are not present in the head count measure. We then measured household living standards, compiles Tibetan poverty statistics, derives minimum dietary energy requirements, simulates the impact of food price or food supply shocks on food insecurity by population groups. We found that Tibetan foodstuff tradition is eating more meat and less grain, the annual consumption of grain is only 269.02 kg per person, which includes 46.02 kg of feedstuff. Only 42.54% of the grain was harvested in Tibet. Many households had little no-agricultural income and few livestock, nearly three quarters of the households (73.27%) had food insecurity. Households headed by females (AOR = 3.47, 93% CI:1.68, 13.21), lack of education (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.46, 4.60), family size of &lt;2 (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.21,4.70), family size of &gt;7 (AOR = 13.23,95% CI:6.18, 28.32), few or absence of livestock (AOR = 5.60, 95% CI:1.28, 24.43), absence of income from off-farm activities (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI:1.53, 6.36), lack of irrigation (AOR = 3.54, 95% CI:2.14, 5.18) and lack of perennial income (AOR = 3.15, 95% CI:1.88, 5.27) were factors associated with food insecurity.

N2  - Food-for-work (FFW) programs are commonly used both for short-term relief and long-term development purposes. In the latter capacity, they are increasingly used for natural resources management projects. Barrett, Holden and Clay (forthcoming) assess the suitability of FFW programs as insurance to cushion the poor against short-term, adverse shocks that could, in the absence of a safety net, have permanent repercussions. In this paper we explore the complementary question of FFW programs' potential to reduce poverty and promote sustainable land use in the longer run through induced changes in investment patterns. 

FFW programs commonly aim to produce or maintain potentially valuable public goods necessary to stimulate productivity and thus income growth. Among the most common projects are road building, reforestation, and the installation of terracing or irrigation. In the abstract, public goods such as these are unambiguously good. There is a danger, however, that such programs could discourage private soil and water conservation and crowd out private investment. How important are such effects and when are these effects small or large and when and how can they be reduced? How do market characteristics, timing and design of FFW programs affect this? When, where and how can FFW programs more efficiently reduce poverty and promote more sustainable land management? The paper aims to answer these questions.

Much recent empirical research has focused on the shorter-term targeting issue of whether FFW and related workfare programs efficiently target the poor (Dev 1995, Von Braun 1995, Webb 1995, Subbarao 1997, Clay et al. 1998, Devereux 1999, Jayne et al. 1999, Ravallion 1999, Teklu and Asefa 1999, Atwood et al. 2000, Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000, Haddad and Adato 2001, Jalan and Ravallion 2001). Much less research has been focused on the longer-term effects of FFW. Yet the large share of hunger worldwide arises due to chronic deprivation and vulnerability, not short-term shocks (Speth 1993, Barrett 2002). Also most of the FFW programs in Ethiopia have long-term development goals and are formally distinguished from the disaster relief FFW programs (Aas and Mellemstrand 2002). It is therefore appropriate to evaluate these programs based on their long-term goals and not only on the basis of short-term targeting. In a case study in Tigray Aas and Mellemstrand (2002) found that the FFW recipients considered the long-term benefits of FFW as more important than the short-term benefits of food provision. 

FFW programs may produce valuable public goods. For example, Von Braun et al. (1999) report multiplier effects of a FFW-built road in the Ethiopian lowlands. Public provision of public goods may be socially desirable because private investment in soil and water conservation and tree planting may be well below socially optimal levels due to poverty and market imperfections (Holden, Shiferaw and Wik 1998, Holden and Shiferaw 2002, Holden and Yohannes 2002, Pender and Kerr 1998), tenure insecurity (Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000, Holden, Benin, Shiferaw and Pender 2003), lack of technical knowledge and coordination problems across farms (Hagos and Holden 2002). There is, however, also a danger that FFW programs crowd out private investments (Gebremedhin and Swinton 2000). 

We analyze these issues using multiple methods. First, section II introduces a simple theoretical framework for understanding the analytically ambiguous effects of FFW programs on sustainable land use patterns. We first present the basic intuition in a static framework to illustrate the selection, crowding out and targeting issues, before generalizing it to a dynamic model to illustrate the possible insurance and crowding in effects of FFW. Section III then uses an applied, dynamic bio-economic farm household model applied to a less-favoured area in Ethiopia to investigate via numerical simulation how household welfare and land use patterns vary with changes in environmental and FFW program design parameters. Section IV presents econometric evidence based on survey panel data from northern Ethiopia to assess the relationship between FFW and private investment in conservation. Section V discusses our findings and fleshes them out a bit with further empirical evidence. Section VI concludes.

N2  - Current premium rate-making methodology for the government-sponsored Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) program adjusts premiums for farms engaging in certain cropping practices. These practices are production methods such as irrigation, fallow and double-cropping. Actuarial evidence has shown that such practices can separate farms into distinct risk classes. We suggest that risk-management tool is another category of practice which could be considered in setting premium rates. The present analysis shall focus on one risk management tool: cash forward contracts. Making this assessment requires that we use a key actuarial concept called loss cost ratio. Preliminary evidence (from sam ple moments of yield distributions) suggests that indeed the loss cost ratio may be lower in the presence of forward contracts when corn, wheat and soybeans are the insured crops.

N2  - The Koshi Basin, spread across China, Nepal and India, is perceived as having high potential for hydropower and irrigation development, both seen as ways to promote economic development in the region. This paper quantifies and assesses the past and projected future spatial and temporal water balances in the Koshi Basin. Results show that precipitation and net water yield are lowest in the transmountain region and the Tibetan plateau. The values are highest in the mountain region, followed by the hills and Indo-Gangetic Plains. Approximately 65% of average annual precipitation is converted to flows, indicating high water availability. Actual evapotranspiration is highest in the Indo-Gangetic Plains region due to the presence of irrigated agriculture and a few forested mountain watersheds. As most of the water from the mountain and hill regions eventually flows down to the plains, the mountain and hill regions in Nepal are important for maintaining agriculture in the plains in both Nepal and India. Results from the flow analyses indicate the high temporal variability of flows in the basin. The frequent occurrences of both high- and low-flow events demonstrate the existing vulnerability of the region to both floods and droughts, leading to a very risk-prone livelihood system. Climate change projections show an increasing trend in precipitation and net water yield for most of the basin, except the transmountain region. Therefore, it is important to consider the climate change impacts on water resources in future planning.

N2  - This Working Paper presents methodological and substantive findings of gender-differentiated quantitative farm household surveys about smallholders’ private irrigation technology adoption in Ghana and Zambia. Focusing on three gender variables, household headship, labor provision and plot management, the paper examines adoption rates, types of technologies and gendered labor provision in female- and male-headed households; compares adoption rates on women’s own plots with overall rates; compares women’s decision-making on irrigated plots and rainfed plots; and examines impacts of targeting strategies. Findings suggest that women are proactive irrigation adopters in spite of the many obstacles they face. Removing those obstacles serves both gender equality and irrigation policies.

N2  - This article aims to investigate some aspects of the social process related to water resources management and gender relations. Given that gender and water management are interrelated issues exposed to a growing attention at the international level, it is therefore necessary to identify relations between the academic literature, the institutional framework and the field-based research. This document has been inspired by the Nostrum DSS project (Network on Governance, Science and Technology for Sustainable Water Resources Management in the Mediterranean), a Co-ordination Action funded by the European Commission, which involves eighteen partners from the North and South shores of the basin. As the scope of the project is to disseminate Best Practice Guidelines for the design and implementation of Decision Support System tools (DSS) to identify optimal water resources management regimes, this article is proposing an analysis of a particular geographical and social frame related to the social actors involved in the project, but there are no connections between the paper and the project itself. To create a network between science, policy and civil society is one of the main objectives of the project in order to reach an improved governance and planning in the field of sustainable water management. Therefore, to investigate gender sensitivity in some areas of the basin shall provide a clue. This overview of academic and institutional background refers to a particular geographical and cultural area, the Middle Eastern and North African region. In the first section lies the theoretical background, that has been extrapolated from international organisations guidelines and scholars' publications. The second section is specifically focused on the Egyptian geographical context. The first paragraph presents a review of the guidelines suggested by international organisations related to policies on gender and water, as parts of the changes that the global scenario has recently been facing, with the shift from the micro level to the macro level. The second paragraph then describes the side effects of these overspread trends, which are identified in their missing relations with the social context of the intervention. The third and fourth paragraphs introduce the issue of women's role in water management in the Middle Eastern and North African Regions, while highlighting relations between women's involvement in the public sphere and the role they cover in local communities organisations. The proportion of the political representation faced by women in this region is also discussed, tackling their overspread participation in agriculture and their unrecognised working status. The fifth paragraph of this paper will discuss a case study in Egypt, concerning an initiative promoted by international donors and the government aimed at increasing community participation in the design and management of irrigation canals. The case study gives a concrete sample to discuss plusses and problems of women's participation in water users organisations, synthesising many of the theoretical issues that have been raised in the first three parts of this article. .

N2  - This study investigated the climate change vulnerability of 6,214 households in the drought-prone districts of Telangana state in India. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were used to group farm households based on their level of vulnerability to climate change and to suggest a portfolio of adaptation strategies. The PCA revealed the presence of five components from 14 key variables: (1) access to irrigation; (2) credit access, landholding, and income from agriculture; (3) household size and income sources; (4) access to information and climate-smart adaptation practices; and (5) social capital. The first five components (eigenvalue ≥ 1) collectively accounted for 60.42 percent of the total variance. Three clusters emerged after the component scores were analyzed using K-means clustering: extremely vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, and resilient households. The results of the cluster analysis revealed that 79 percent of the households were extremely vulnerable, 11.20 percent were moderately vulnerable, and 9.65 percent were resilient. Moreover, 96 percent of marginal farmers and 94 percent of smallholder farmers were extremely vulnerable, while 19 percent of large farmers and 16 percent of medium farmers were moderately vulnerable. Interestingly, nearly 26 percent in the extremely vulnerable category and 19 percent in the moderately vulnerable category were large farmers, which contradicts previous assumptions. The findings of this study can guide development practitioners, policymakers, and donors in designing evidence-based programs focusing on households vulnerable to climate change.

N2  - At the end of 2021, CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) will be replaced by Initiatives housed within One CGIAR. This new modality is intended to achieve higher levels of impact at a faster rate and at reduced cost compared to the CRPs. As One CGIAR begins, there is a unique opportunity to reflect on what has worked in different contexts. In this paper, we provide findings that relate to One CGIAR’s overarching view of how it will achieve positive and measurable impacts, and for agricultural research for development (AR4D) more generally. Specifically, we draw from three related CRP evaluations to identify how different types of AR4D approaches have contributed to successful outcomes. In the final section of the paper, we present our conclusions and provide a list of recommendations for the science and technology policy of One CGIAR and possibly other integrated research for development programs.

N2  - The purpose of this Guide is to provide an overview of the major considerations and steps to be followed in organizing new irrigation farmers’ organizations or Irrigation Water Users’ Associations (IWUAs). The Guide should support developing or strengthening a specialized formal IWUA for implementing a program aimed at creating or improving a collectively managed irrigation scheme. The Guide is focused on programs involving construction of new irrigation schemes; rehabilitation, modernization or revitalization of existing irrigation schemes; or supporting farmers wishing to improve the performance of their irrigation scheme. While based on extensive research and evidence, the intended audience for this Guide is the set of practitioners responsible for planning and implementing communal irrigation programs. This may include managers of publicly or externally supported projects, government agricultural and irrigation officials, private investments and nongovernmental organizations. The Guide draws on over 50 years of experience organizing farmers to participate in the creation, improvement and management of both farmer-managed and government-managed irrigation schemes. The major lesson learned is that investing in the “software” component – training and institutional development – of irrigation is critical for success. If the IWUA is weak or ineffective, the scheme will fail to achieve its potential, no matter how good the hardware is. The Guide seeks to avoid imposing a specific organizational design for what an institution should look like and do, but suggests a process organized around six ‘steps’ to be followed, more or less in sequence. Using these steps creatively as a guideline, not as a recipe to be followed precisely, will increase the likelihood that irrigation investments achieve the desired project goals.

N2  - Groundwater over-exploitation is a common phenomenon in many arid and semi arid regions of the world.
Within India, north Gujarat is one of such intensively exploited regions. Groundwater supports irrigated
crop production and intensive dairy farming in the region. Well irrigation is critical to the region’s rural
economy and livelihoods. The overall objective of the study was to examine the water demand
management interventions on farming system, livelihood patterns, food and nutritional security and
poverty. The study was based on the primary data collected from north Gujarat. The study suggests that
the micro irrigation (MI) technology adoption had resulted in reduction in water application and
improvement in crop yield varied from crop to crop. On an average, the net returns from MI irrigated plots
are higher than that of plots irrigated by conventional method. The water productivity of the crops
irrigated by MIs, in both physical and economic terms, was found to be much higher than that of their
counterparts irrigated by traditional method. The benefit-cost analysis of MI-systems shows significant
variations among different crops. The overall impact of MI adoption on the income of adopter families is
striking, exceeding one lac rupees per annum. Such high escalations in annual income of a farm household
can change the entire household dynamics. Adoption of MI systems with the introduction of new waterefficient
crops had resulted in significant reduction in water use at the farm level. The average reduction
was estimated to be 7527m3 per farm, whereas at the regional level, the total groundwater saving for
irrigation was estimated to be 224MCM per annum.

N2  - Smallholder rice farming is central to poverty reduction, food security, and rural development in the Philippines. Currently, rice affordability is threatened by the country's protectionist approach to rice imports and low production efficiency. One key issue is that around 41 percent of the country's irrigable land is not irrigated. Moreover, many irrigation systems are suggested to be poorly managed with unequal water distribution. The Irrigated Rice Production Enhancement Project (IRPEP) was implemented in three regions (VI, VII and X) of the Philippines between 2010-2015. It was designed to improve rice productivity and smallholder livelihoods by strengthening canal irrigation infrastructure of Communal Irrigation Systems (CIS), improving the capacity of the Irrigators' Associations (IAs) that manage the CIS, and offering complementary marketing support, Farmer Field Schools, and emergency seed buffer stocks. As the government provides FFS and buffer stocks to farmers across the country, we focus the assessment on the irrigation and marketing activities only. We define the impact indicators based on IRPEP's theory of change, which maps the inputs and activities of the project to outcomes and impacts through various channels. The analysis is based on quantitative data from 2,104 households and 113 IAs covering beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups, along with qualitative data from project and IA staff. We estimate IRPEP's impact by comparing beneficiary and non-beneficiary households and IAs using statistical matching techniques to ensure a clean and unbaised comparison. We then use the qualitative data to try to identify the underlying factors that shaped the results. We particularly focus our analysis on regional heterogeneities in impacts because of the considerable differences between the three project regions. The main difference between regions stems from their varying levels of exposure to extreme weather events (e.g. super typhoons), as Region VIII, and to a lesser extent Region VI, experienced significant extreme weather damage during the project's implementation.

N2  - The Republic of Tajikistan is a land locked country, where most of the territory (93%) is occupied by mountains. Poverty is quite widespread with about half of the country’s population living below the poverty line. The poorest people in the country reside in the Khatlon region, where 78 per cent of the population lives under the national poverty line and where land is degraded, the availability of inputs and credit is limited, irrigation facilities are lacking, and access to improved technologies and markets is poor (World Bank, 2015). About 50 per cent of the population depends on agriculture for livelihood, and most farmers lack access to adequate inputs, resources, technology and markets. Livestock is a key part of the agricultural sector and it is of critical importance in the livelihood strategy of poor rural households in Tajikistan. The pasture management system in Tajikistan remains largely unchanged since Soviet times with the exception that the lowest rung in the management system (corporate farms) no longer has adequate resources for pasture upkeep nor an adequate management system. The inadequacy of such a centralized management system is reflected in the overexploitation of pasture which has led to a vicious cycle of ever-lower animal yields and rural income, which is triggered by the legitimate will of farmers to increase their livestock production by adding animal units. This, in turn, has created a greater demand for feed, leading to a decrease in the feed per animal ratio, to a deterioration of the grazing land and to a further fall in animal weight. As a result, the rise in livestock inventories coupled with the fall in feed supplies has meant the dramatic fall of livestock productivity, low milk and meat yields and land degradation in the country, further worsening poverty among households. To address and overcome these problems, the Government of Tajikistan launched the Livestock and Pasture Development Project (LPDP) in August 2011, a project financed jointly by IFAD and the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. The project had the goal of reducing poverty in the Khatlon region, increasing the nutritional status and incomes of rural poor households by boosting livestock productivity through the improvement of the productive capacity of pastures.

N2  - This report presents the results of an ex-post impact assessment of the Participatory Small-scale Irrigation Development Programme (PASIDP), a project financed by IFAD and implemented in Ethiopia between 2008 and 2015. This agricultural project aimed at improving food security and increasing income of beneficiaries by providing access to small-scale irrigation infrastructure systems in four regions of Ethiopia. The objective of the impact assessment was to investigate both the sustainability of the impacts and the resilience capacity of beneficiaries in a context characterized by adverse weather conditions. An innovative data collection was put in place to study the impact on areas where a protracted drought was taking place. In particular, using panel data that allowed one to follow household over time, the analysis tested whether the irrigation schemes were able to provide a protective and sustained effect towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing smallholders households resilience capacity to cope with the longer term variability of the climatic shocks.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries often lack appropriate cereal storage facilities which can contribute to food insecurity and low cereal commercialization, particularly when they can only rely on one cropping season with no irrigation. Lack of quality storage can lead to post-harvest losses (Abass et al, 2014; Sheahan and Barrett, 2017) and often compels smallholder farmers to sell their crops soon after harvest, when crop prices are at their seasonal lowest, only for them to buy grain for consumption during the lean season, when prices are high (Kadjo et al, 2018; Aggarwal et al, 2018; Stephens and Barrett, 2011). In many instances, such farmers need food assistance to survive the lean season and in other cases, they may have to borrow money at usurious rates in order to purchase food. This was the case in Guéra Region of Chad, a semi-arid area that frequently experiences droughts and dry spells in ways that severely reduce crop production and rural households’ food security. To address these issues, the IFAD-funded Programme d'Appui au Développement Rural dans le Guéra (PADER-G) project was implemented with the main objective of supporting poor rural households and smallholder farmers in Guéra, Chad to improve their food security and livelihoods. One specific aim of PADER-G, designed to manage risks of food shortage, was to improve cereal storage among smallholder farmers through the construction of community cereal banks (banque de céréales). This main element of the project was complemented with the establishment of community committees (Comité de gestion des banques de soudure – COGES) which were trained on effective management of the cereal banks.

N2  - Investments in irrigation systems have been shown to substantially improve farmers’ productivity, and thus alleviate poverty. This study provides an example of such an investment: the Participatory Small-Scale Irrigation Development Programme. The project institutionalized water user associations, developed small-scale irrigation schemes, and provided agricultural training activities to smallholder farmers in drought-prone and food-deficit areas in four regions of Ethiopia. Combining a primary household survey with geographical data, this work estimates the project impact on agricultural production and household expenditure using a novel identification strategy. Beneficiaries' gains include improved crop yields and greater diversity of crops cultivated. These gains have the potential to raise revenues and enable a switch from subsistence to purchasing more food from the market. The lessons learned from this study, by highlighting the need to focus on strengthening access to market, in conjunction with the irrigation infrastructural support, have the potential to improve the design and implementation of future small-scale irrigation projects. The added focus on access to markets would provide greater opportunities to projects beneficiaries by maximising farmers' improved productive capacity.

N2  - The interest in promoting food and water security through development projects has evolved to the need for tools that can evaluate the impact of these projects, and to ensure that the projects reach the most vulnerable (Gertler et al., 2011). This study brings together the stochastic frontier model with impact evaluation methodology to measure the impact on farmers’ technical efficiency (TE) within a modern irrigation technology transition framework. In this study, we apply the Heckman (1979) and Greene (2010) models to correct for selectivity bias that arises from unobserved variables, and then we measure and compare technical efficiency scores (TE) resulting from these models. The empirical application will use data covering 56 small-scale greenhouse farms, mainly cultivating vegetables, from the Ierapetra Valley in the Southeast part of the island of Crete (Greece) for the cropping years from 2009 to 2013. The results reveal that the average technical efficiency for farmers who adopted sprinklers is lower than the group of non-adopters when the presence of selectivity bias cannot be rejected. This outcome can be explained by the fact that after the adoption of new technologies, adopters may need more time to learn how to use the technology efficiently.

N2  - Malawi agriculture has undergone various policy regimes targeted at improving productivity and food self-sufficiency. Policy influence has often come from the World Bank and other donors who have pushed for a costly and state minimalist policy, against government wish for a welfarist approach. This situation has created a long-standing schism between the Bank and Government since the signing of the first SAP loan in 1981, thus affecting implementation of agricultural policies. This has resulted in food market reforms being partial and often reversed, with state marketing boards still playing a major role. These have created instability in maize prices and stocks in the national strategic grain reserve, often resulting in food crises and putting into question the achievements of the farm input subsidy program in achieving food security. This paper analyses the impact of Malawi agricultural policies on crop productivity over the past fifty years (1964-2014) and the resulting food security status of the country by drawing on national level data. This is confounded by the fact that up to 38% of Malawians still do not get adequate food supplies and the percentage of stunted children is high at 42.4%. Dietary diversification, improved research and technology development and transfer, upscaling of irrigation and policy consistency are critical to achieving national and household food security. Equally, development and empowerment of the private sector is the panacea for a strong maize marketing system that would deliver stable supply and pricing

N1  - Presented during the 24th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis (Virtual Conference)
N2  - Many countries have planned or implemented long-distance inter-basin water transfer projects to resolve water scarcity due to spatially imbalanced water application. The South-North water transfer project (SNWTP) in China is among the largest inter-basin water transfer projects built so far, which would transfer water from Changjiang (Yangtze) river to northern regions, in order to fulfill the gap between limited water supply and increasing water demand from civil, industrial, agricultural and ecosystem purposes. In order to research how will SNWTP influence future crop production, cropland expansion and irrigation water use, we use a model with global to spatial scale to project agricultural production from 2017 to 2050 with different SNWTP implementation and operation scenarios. Under current scenario of water transfer capacity, crop production would increase by 60.05% and cropland would expand by 4.01%. Increasing amount of water transfer from current level to full capacity of the whole SNWTP would decrease irrigation water use in water donating basins by 0.20% - 0.35%, while it would increase irrigation water use in water receiving basins by 0.4% - 4.67%. Along transfer routes, the mainstream Huai river basin is most responsive to SNWTP in irrigation water use, crop production and irrigated cropland expansion, where results indicate that impact of SNWTP would be spatial heterogeneous on local level as well. The multi-scale analysis of SNWTP’s agricultural impact implies the importance of taken local impact and response of inter-basin water transfer into planning and associated policy making.

Ethiopia. Combining a primary household survey with detailed geographical information, we estimate the impact of the project on agricultural production and households
expenditures using a novel quasi-experimental approach. Beneficiaries gain from the
project through improved crop yields, which raise revenues, and allow switching from
relying mainly consuming their own produce to purchasing greater amount of food from
the market. Though we rule out that the project may have targeted farmers based on
their agricultural performance, summary statistics indicate notable differences between
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, an indication that the project might have systematically targeted farmers with certain attributes. Systematic targeting is often favoured either to ensure the highest rate of success, or to deliver the project to those who may need it the most, but may limit the generalizability of the project in relation to any efforts to scaling up.

N2  - This paper examines the impact of quality and reliability of irrigation on water productivity of individual
crops and cropping system in the farm through comparison of crops watered by different types of irrigation systems
such as canal irrigation; well irrigation and conjunctive use. Then it analyzes the actual factors that drive differential
productivity, and which change due to change in quality and reliability regime of irrigation. The study area is Bist
Doab area in Punjab and the analysis was carried out for two agro-climatic regions, both semi-arid, one having
medium to high rainfall and the other having low to medium rainfall. The first location (Changarwan) is predominantly
canal and well irrigated, whereas the second location (Skohpur) has well irrigation and conjunctive use.
The analysis involved working out an index called “irrigation quality index” for different types of irrigation
systems, and then compares water productivity of individual crops vis-à-vis estimated values of this index, for each
location. The crop water productivity parameters analyzed are: physical productivity of water in kg/m3
; and water
productivity in economic terms.
Overall, the irrigation quality index was higher for: well irrigated fields as compared to canal irrigated
fields and fields irrigated by both wells and canals in Skohpur; and canal irrigated fields for most crops in Changarwan.
Comparison of irrigation water quality index estimated for major crops under different sources of irrigation vis-à-vis
the water productivity of the respective crops show that differential reliability has an impact on economic productivity
of water (Rs/m3
). The fields, which received irrigation water of higher quality and reliability got higher water
productivity in rupee terms. However, the impact of differential quality and reliability was not visible on physical
productivity of water for fodder crops.
Contrary to the belief that higher quality and reliability of irrigation would result in better yields, the fields,
which were receiving poor quality irrigation gave higher yields. This was primarily due to the high nutrient load
which canal water contained that increased the yield of those crops. Fodder crops also gave higher yields under less
reliable irrigation water supply. Hence, one can conclude that improved quality and reliability of irrigation would
help enhance the water productivity in crop production.

N2  - This paper aims to analyze the effects of climate change on Brazilian agriculture considering irrigation adoption as an adaptation strategy. Investigation on how climatic variability influences irrigation adoption was performed as well as whether this adaptation measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used matching methods to analyze the choice of irrigation in the first stage and the land values for two types of farmer (irrigators or dryland) in the second stage. Temperature and precipitation projections for the 2010-2099 time period were used, considering different climate scenarios, according the 4th Assessment Report of IPCC (2007). Simulation results showed that irrigation can be a very effective tool to counteract the harmful effects of climate change. Land values for irrigated production are less vulnerable than those of rainfed production. Farmers' income tends to grow on lands where irrigation techniques are practiced, while on those where agricultural production is exclusively rainfed, losses can sum to approximately 14% in relation to current period. These conclusions confirm the need to invest in adaptation strategies in order to make Brazil ready to cope with the adverse effects of global climate change.

N2  - Water resources are important for current and future socioeconomic development of any country. To manage water resources sustainably requires a good understanding of the current and future availability of these resources at local level: how much water is available, where is it available and when? This paper assesses the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and the impacts of projected climate change on water resource availability, and draws implications for irrigation development in Zambia. Unlike past studies done at national level, this study is at river basin level. Using a water balance model in a hydrological modeling framework and statistical downscaling of future climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the paper simulates the impacts of climate change on water availability in Zambia’s main river basins from current periods until the end of the century in 2100. The main results indicate that temperature increases in Zambia are projected to reach 1.9o C and 2.3o C by 2050 and 2100, respectively. Rainfall is projected to decrease by about 3% by mid-century and only marginally by about 0.6% towards the end of the century across the country. However, there are large differences across the different regions, with the southern, western and eastern regions projected to be much more affected compared to the northern region. These changes in rainfall and temperature will reduce water availability by about 13% from current (observed) levels of about 97 km3 to about 84 km3 by the end of the century at national level. At the river basin level, the northern basins are likely to stay the same or experience slight increases in water resources compared to those in the southern and western parts of Zambia. In particular, Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa River Basins are projected to have less water resources available due to reduced rainfall and higher temperatures . These findings have implications for smallholder irrigation development in Zambia. First, this implies that contingent on costs, current and future irrigation schemes will need to adopt more water efficient technologies such as overhead irrigation systems (e.g., center pivots and drip irrigation) as opposed to the prevalent surface irrigation methods. Second, reduced water availability will increase access and irrigation costs, which in turn may reduce its profitability among smallholder farmers as they tend to have limited capital and capacity to adapt to higher cost structures. Third, competition for the reduced available water resources will disadvantage the smallholder farmers. Policies to protect them against the large scale users are required. Options for bulky water transfer from low-demand, high-water areas in the north to the high-demand, low-water areas in the south should be explored. Fourth, water resources management and regulation need to be strengthened, for example by ensuring that water user rights and fees become mandatory, even among smallholder farmers. There is also need to improve rain water harvesting and storage by investing in more efficient reservoirs. How these reservoirs should be managed to ensure equitable access to water resources and to reduce water loss due evapotranspiration requires further thought.

Improved water and land management in the Ethiopian highlands: its impact on downstream stakeholders dependent on the Blue Nile. Intermediate Results Dissemination Workshop held at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 5-6 February 2009. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - With its total area of about 200,000 square kilometers (km2), which is 20% of the country’s land mass, and accommodating 25% of the population, the Upper Blue Nile Basin (Abbay) is one of the most important river basins in Ethiopia. About 40% of agricultural products and 45% of the surface water of the country are contributed by this basin. However, the characteristic-intensive biophysical variation, rapid population growth, land degradation, climatic fluctuation and resultant low agricultural productivity and poverty are posing daunting challenges to sustainability of agricultural production systems in the basin. This calls for technological interventions that not only enhance productivity and livelihoods in the basin, but also bring about positive spillover effects on downstream water users. In this study, the farming systems in the basin have been stratified and characterized; and promising agricultural water management technologies, which may upgrade the productivity of smallholder rainfed agriculture while improving downstream water quality, have been identified. As a consequence, supplementary and full irrigation using rainwater and drainage of waterlogged soils are recognized as being among the promising agricultural water management technologies that can be easily scaled-up in the basin. The magnitude of the impacts of these technologies on the productivity of the upstream farming systems and the concomitant effects on the downstream water flow and quality are under investigation, assuming an assortment of scenarios.

N2  - The agricultural sector of Uzbekistan is still characterized by unsustainable production patterns and the agricultural institutions of the country are controlled to a large extent through government intervention. The Government takes the decision to grow cotton and wheat and fix the output prices. The decision about the production quotas for cotton and wheat leads to a restricted area and water availability for growing other crops. The country is affected by a locally occurring climate change as well as regional climate change threatens to aggravate existing water use conflicts. The current and expected climatic conditions are showing the additional irrigation applications for a sustainable and fruitful agricultural production. The partial implementation of reforms such as privatization and liberalization of agricultural markets affect the development of agriculture and agricultural trade in Uzbekistan. This paper highlights the major effects of market and price liberalization on agricultural trade using the partial equilibrium model AGRISIM which is based on the "Static World Policy Simulation Model" (SWOPSIM)of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).With the help of the model, changes in general economic conditions and policy intervention in agricultural markets and foreign trade are simulated. The study suggests that the issues of sustainable agriculture
development and food security in Uzbekistan can be achieved through, liberalization of
agricultural markets and trade specially wheat and cotton.

N1  - Paper presented at the Ethiopia National Nile Development Forum, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 20-21 March 2008
N2  - This paper introduces and highlights some results of a multi-institutional collaborative
research project under implementation related to “Improved water and land management
in the Ethiopian highlands and its impact on downstream stakeholders dependent on the
Blue Nile”. In the Nile Basin, water from the Ethiopian highlands, particularly from the
Blue Nile (Abay), has in the past benefited downstream people in Sudan and Egypt in
different ways – agriculture, livestock, industry and electrical power. However, such free
benefits are now threatened due to dramatically changing land, water and livestock
management practices upstream. High population pressure, lack of alternative livelihood
opportunities and the slow pace of rural development are inducing deforestation,
overgrazing, land degradation and declining agricultural productivity. Poor water and
land management upstream reduces both potential runoff yields and the quality of water
reaching downstream. The result is a vicious cycle of poverty and food insecurity for
millions in the upstream; and poor water quality, heavy siltation, flooding, and poor
temporal water distribution in the downstream threatening livelihood and economies in
the downstream. It is widely recognized that improved water management in the Abay
Basin will significantly increase water availability for various stakeholders within the
basin. Key research questions raised in the project include: What are the successful
interventions that help improve productivity and reverse degradation? What are the
impacts downstream? What are the opportunities and constraints enhancing rural
livelihoods and food security? Focusing around these questions, intermediate results
related to meteorological, hydrological and physical based basin characterization,
methodologies for erosion and sediment modelling, water availability and access for
various production systems are presented. Synergies and complementarities with Nile
Basin shared vision and subsidiary action projects, particularly with the Eastern Nile are
also highlighted.

N2  - This paper provides a brief synthesis of research conducted on gender in irrigation, and the tools and frameworks used in the past to promote improvement for women in on-farm agricultural water management. It then presents results from the pilot of the Gender in Irrigation Learning and Improvement Tool (GILIT) in locations in Malawi and Uzbekistan in 2015. Through the results of the tool, the paper looks at benefit sharing between men and women farmers: (i) access to irrigation scheme resources (including information, for example, in the design phase; land, water and other inputs); (ii) participation in scheme management; and (iii) access to scheme benefits, including access to market information, packaging and payments. The indicators for the tool were modelled after principles reflected in existing gender policies and strategies, and intended to improve performance at field level in line with national and regional goals. The paper concludes with informal and formal constraints to gender-equitable outcomes from irrigation investments identified during the pilot, and suggests how the tool can be used by various development actors to improve the benefits for women from investments in agricultural water management.

N2  - This paper reviews the evidence available on the provision of financing for African smallholder farmers to purchase irrigation equipment such as pumps, pipes and drip irrigation systems. It sets the scene by first reviewing the literature on experiences with providing microcredit and other microfinance services as a poverty reduction strategy. Based on both case studies and several systematic reviews of the literature, it finds that the outcomes and impacts on poverty, gender equity and broader economic development are mixed at best. Microcredit is not a silver bullet solution to poverty, but it can often help poor households improve their lives. The paper then reviews the demand for and supply of financing for smallholders to purchase irrigation equipment. In surveys, farmers express a strong demand for equipment such as pumps, but often point to the lack of affordable and appropriately designed credit as a critical impediment to gaining access to such equipment. Even where microfinance institutions offer agricultural credit, it is usually short-term seasonal credit to purchase seeds and fertilizer. Credit on these terms is not useful to purchase equipment costing several hundred dollars. Focusing on programs specifically aimed at enabling farmers to purchase irrigation equipment, no credible detailed studies were found documenting the impacts and lessons learned. However, there are currently (as of 2018) numerous promising pilot studies and small projects offering a variety of approaches to enable smallholders to make such purchases. The paper reviews what information is available on these. A major recommendation of this paper is that a research project should be designed to carry out studies of these various experiments to identify what works under what conditions, as a basis for scaling out programs to offer financial services aimed at assisting smallholders to gain access to small-scale irrigation equipment.

Hyderabad, India: International Water Management Institute (IWMI), South Asia Sub Regional Office
N2  - This article shows how the various considerations for analyzing water productivity (WP) differ due to the
differences in stakeholder interests, and objectives and units of analysis. Also it identifies some major gaps in WP
research and the key drivers of change in WP. The main arguments are: 1] in developing economies like India the
objective of WP research should also be to maximize net return per unit of water and aggregate returns for the
farmer, rather than merely enhancing “crop per drop”; 2] the determinant for analyzing the impact of efficient
irrigation technologies on basin level WP and water saving should be consumed fraction (CF) rather than evapotranspiration;
3] in closed basins, determinants for analyzing basin level WP improvement through water harvesting
and conservation should be incremental economic returns &amp; opportunity costs; 4] at the field level, the reliability
of irrigation water and changing water allocation could be the key drivers of change in WP that need to be
analyzed, whereas at the farm level, changes in the crop mix and farming system could be key drivers of change. In
composite farming systems, measures to enhance WP should be based on farm-level analysis involving considerations
such as risk taking ability and investment capabilities of the farmer. Finally, the options to enhance WP in agriculture
seem to be quite limited, given the larger objective of addressing food security, poverty alleviation, and employment
generation concerns in rural areas.

N2  - Based on research presented in the book “Water Productivity in Agriculture : Limits and Opportunities for Improvement” by J.W. Kijne, R. Barker and D. Molden. If current trends continue, the water crisis—which is already beginning to rear its head in many countries through depleted groundwater aquifers, dried-up rivers and wetlands, and frequent water shortages—will indeed become a global problem. A recent study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) projects that if present trends continue, by 2025 competition from growing cities and industry worldwide will limit the amount of water available for irrigation, causing annual global losses of 350 million metric tons of food production - slightly more than the entire current U.S. grain crop. The environment will also sustain further damage, as water from this already thirsty sector is diverted to agriculture, households and industry. If levels of investment in sustainable water policy and management decrease over the next 20 years, the result will be major declines in food production and skyrocketing food prices. research done over the past decade shows that by improving the productivity of water on irrigated and rain-fed lands, we can have enough water for cities, industry and nature. But this requires a commitment to institutional and management reforms, and substantial investment in crop research, technology, and infrastructure.

N2  - Assam in the north eastern region of India has the endowments to ensure agricultural growth in the sense that the state has huge reserves of ground water in addition to the enormous surface water availability. Returns to both labor and capital in the state are considered high as potentials for exploiting the existing technology are yet largely untapped. As insufficient irrigation infrastructure is identified as a major constraint on exploiting such potentials, investment for expanding irrigation capacity is needed. At the same time, putting necessary institutions in place to ensure that the installed capacity is effectively utilized is also equally important. Compared to relatively larger government irrigation schemes, the privately owned and operated tube well based small scale projects in the state have relatively better utilization efficiency. However, utilisation of irrigation potential of these schemes is also affected by fragmented and small size of holdings in the state. Emergence of the institution of ground water markets, however, is expected to improve utilisation efficiency of irrigation as it can make optimal use of the scarce natural resource of ground water. To investigate into some of the questions related with enhancing utilization efficiency and better management of the common pool resource of ground water, a study of ground water markets in Assam was taken up. Using inputs from field investigations, the study examined the nature of ground water markets in the state, the issue of reliability of water supply and the conditions for viability of this market for ensuring better management of ground water resource in Assam. The study points out that apart from improving utilization efficiency of irrigation, reliability of water use has also increased considerably with emergence of ground water markets in the state.

In an attempt to put the South African situation in a broader context, institutional arrangements related to credit provision to small­-scale farmers in Ghana, Tanzania and Pakistan are described. For two case studies from South Africa, regression models are used to estimate the impact of credit, extension and land tenure arrangements on small-scale farmers' net income. The findings confirm the positive impact of access to institutions on farmers' performance. We conclude by stressing the importance of institutions in small-scale irrigation fanning and suggest that more emphasis should be put on the development of effective institutions in policy, program implementation and research.

N2  - This paper draws together findings from different elements of a research project
examining critical components of pro-poor agricultural growth and of policies that can
promote such growth in poor rural economies in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Agricultural growth, a critical driver in poverty reducing growth in many poor
agrarian economies in the past, faces many difficulties in today’s poor rural areas in
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of these difficulties are endogenous to these
areas while others result from broader processes of global change. Active state
interventions in ‘kick starting’ markets in 20th century green revolutions suggest that
another major difficulty may be current policies which emphasize the benefits of
liberalization and state withdrawal but fail to address critical institutional constraints to
market and economic development in poor rural areas.
This broad hypothesis was tested in an analysis of the returns (in agricultural
growth and poverty reduction) to different government spending in India over the last
forty years. The results reject the alternate hypothesis underlying much current policy,
that fertilizer and credit subsidies, for example, depressed agricultural growth and
poverty reduction in the early stages of agricultural transformation. The results show
initially high but then declining impacts from fertilizer subsidies; high benefits from
investment in roads, education and agricultural R&amp;D during all periods and varying
benefits from credit subsidies over four decades; low impacts from power subsidies; and
intermediate impacts from irrigation investments. These findings demand a fundamental
reassessment of policies espousing state withdrawal from markets in poor agrarian
economies. Given widespread state failure in many poor agrarian economies today,
particularly in Africa, new thinking is urgently needed to find alternative ways of ‘kick
starting’ markets – ways which reduce rent seeking opportunities, promote rather than
crowd-out private sector investment, and allow the state to withdraw as economic growth
proceeds.
To investigate some of the potential opportunities and difficulties in achieving
pro-poor agricultural growth in poor rural economies today, empirical work on Malawi
and Zimbabwe used farm-household, rural economy and CGE models to analyze the
structure of different rural livelihoods and to simulate policy impacts on livelihoods, rural
growth and poverty. This work, together with findings from wider reviews and the Indian
econometric work, highlighted very diverse constraints, opportunities and behavior
among different household types and confirmed the importance of smallholder
agricultural growth for poverty reduction through its impacts on labour and grain markets
(even where it accounts for less than 50% of rural incomes). However, large productivity
increases are needed from labour saving technical change if smallholder agriculture is to
drive pro-poor growth, backed up by growth in the rural non-farm economy and longer-term
tradable non-agricultural growth drivers for sustained poverty reduction. Where
productive labour demanding technologies exist, there are large potential pro-poor
growth benefits from reducing transaction costs to improve access to agricultural markets and from increased smallholder household liquidity. Liquidity constraints lead to
important synergies between some forms of welfare support and agricultural productivity
and growth, while institutional development is needed to improve access to input, output
and financial markets. Market intervention policies that stimulate the development of
otherwise thin food grain and input markets can stimulate pro-poor growth if the major
practical problems in the implementation of these policies can be addressed, and if these
policies are backed up by significant and long term, but flexible and targeted investments.
Where widespread and large-scale increases in productivity cannot be achieved,
agriculture will not be able to drive the overall rural growth and structural change needed
to provide the base for significant poverty reduction. It still, however, has a vital role to
play in ‘livelihood protection and enhancement’: supporting people’s existing livelihoods
and maintaining the natural resource base. Policies and investment in this ‘livelihood
protection and enhancement’ role for agriculture should not be so demanding as those
required for pro-poor agricultural growth, in terms of minimum scale, impact,
coordination or institutional capacity needed for success. Nevertheless, significant
investments will still be needed to develop appropriate technologies, to facilitate
coordinated service provision for smallholder farmers, and to encourage a more secure
and favorable political and economic environment conducive to agricultural and rural
investment. The returns to these investments need to be analyzed against the costs of
livelihood and natural resource failure in these poor rural areas, and against the human
and fiscal costs of these rural communities’ becoming increasingly dependent on long
term welfare support and emergency relief.

N2  - This paper examines the institutional arrangements that facilitate irrigation management and the present state of irrigation management and establishes where problems have occurred in the operation of Gibe-Lemu and Gambela-Terre Small-scale irrigation systems. The study employed the case study approach to tackle the research. Key informant and expert interview, desk review of different documents produced about the projects, group discussion, direct observation and structured interview schedule were used to collect data. The study proved the proposition that the government has uncritically supported the irrigation systems. Enabling legal system of land and water rights, strong woreda level state irrigation agency, support services (irrigation extension) and wellestablished water users associations through which purposes of irrigation are achieved were not adequately planned and put in place. These shortcomings undermined irrigation management, ultimately risked feasibility and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Findings revealed poor record of accomplishment, in spite of the difference between the two systems, in managing water distribution in terms of the three most important performance indicators: adequacy, reliability and equity in water distribution. Water related conflicts are rampant but not settled yet. In addition, results indicated that irrigation had positively impacted irrigators’ livelihoods in terms of diversification and intensification of crop production, household income, housing and employment generation and this social effect of irrigation was significantly different between irrigation systems (due to difference in the institutional and socioeconomic context of the two irrigation systems) and locations within irrigation systems. Nonetheless, many irrigators did not maintain these positive changes for long. The constraints were scarcity and unreliability of water and management and socioeconomic problems. These, in turn, were mediated by lack of: a) clearly defined and well enforced institutions of land and water rights; b) technical problems in design and construction; c) inadequate institutional capacity of the local state irrigation agency to coordinate and support decentralized management of irrigation; d) policy related problems; e) inadequate organization of users for self management; and f) problematic social relation of power among water users. Finally, the paper draws a number of conclusions, using the theoretical notions like context, social requirement for use, social effects and social construction, about policy options and requirements in the readjustment of the surveyed irrigation systems and in the design of irrigation projects of these types.

N2  - Ethiopia is at a critical crossroads with a large and increasing population, a depressed national
economy, insufficient agricultural production, and a low number of developed energy sources.
The upper Blue Nile basin harbors considerable untapped potential for irrigation and hydropower
development and expansion. Numerous hydrologic models have been developed to assess
hydropower and agricultural irrigation potential within the basin, yet often fail to adequately
address critical aspects, including the transient stages of large-scale reservoirs, relevant flow
retention policies and associated downstream ramifications, and the implications of stochastic
modeling of variable climate and climate change. A hydrologic model with dynamic climate
capabilities is constructed to assess these aspects. The model indicates that large-scale
development typically produces benefit-cost ratios from 1.2-1.8 under historical climate regimes
for the projects specified. Climate change scenarios indicate potential for small benefit-cost
increases, but reflect possible significant decreases. Stochastic modeling of scenarios
representing a doubling of the historical frequency of El Niño events indicates benefit-cost ratios
as low as 1.0 due to a lack of timely water. An evaluation of expected energy growth rates
reinforces the need for significant economic planning and the necessity of securing energy trade
contracts prior to extensive development. A Ramsey growth model for energy development
specifies project multipliers on total GDP over the 100-year simulation ranging from 1.7-5.2, for
various climatologic conditions.

N2  - This paper combines a micro-level structural econometric model of farmland allocation and a market-level equilibrium supply-demand model in order to simulate the effects of climate changes on agricultural production, food prices and social welfare. The estimation accounts for corner solutions associated with disaggregated land-use data, whose usage enables treating prices as exogenous. We employ the model for assessing climate-change impacts in Israel, in which agriculture is protected by import tariffs. We find that projected climate changes are beneficial to farmers, particularly due to the positive impact of the forecasted temperature rise on field crops. Fruit production are projected to decline, and reduce consumer surpluses, but to a lower extent than the increase in total agricultural profits. Nearly 20% of the profit rise is attributed to farmers adaptation through land reallocation. Adaptation to the projected reduction in precipitation by increasing irrigation is found warranted from farmers perspective; however, it is not beneficial to society as a whole. Abolishing import tariffs effectively transfers surpluses from producers to consumers, but its impact on social welfare becomes positive only under large climate changes.

N2  - Water resources are facing several stresses in terms of quantity and quality. These pressures are closely related to the human interventions in fields like: agriculture, land-use/land use change, construction/management of reservoirs, pollutant emissions, and water /wastewater treatment, among others. Considering the critical role that water plays for agricultural production, any shock in water availability will have great implications for agricultural production, and through agricultural markets these impacts will reach the whole economy with economy-wide consequences. The aim of this report is to present a literature review about the state of the art methodology regarding the study of water issues using the CGE approach at global and national scale. The analysis of the different studies confirms the economy wide consequences of changes in water allocation, irrigation policies, and climate change, among others water related issues.

N2  - In arid areas, irrigation water is an essential input into agricultural production. However, rainfall and, correspondingly, surface water supplies, are often highly variable, creating uncertainty over the value of long-term, water-dependent investments in these cropping systems. Moreover, climate change is expected to increase both crop water requirements and the variability of seasonal rainfall, meaning the constraints imposed by variable water supplies are likely to grow in cost as climate change progresses. In this setting, storing water in wet years for use in dry years is valuable. In particular, it would be expected to increase the value of perennial crops, which require large up-front investments that pay off gradually over the life of the tree. We first show, in a simple theoretical model, that given the timing of returns to investments in perennial crops, there is always some level of drought risk above which annual crops will be preferred to perennials. We then demonstrate this effect empirically using a unique institutional setting in which access to a relatively new form of water storage, groundwater banking, effectively created spatial variation drought risk between irrigation districts in Kern County, California. Using a 21-year dataset of individual cropping decisions, we provide evidence that access to a large groundwater banking project, the Kern Water Bank, increased the rate at which farmers switched from lower-value annual crops such as wheat and alfalfa, into high-value perennial nut crops, primarily almonds and pistachio.

N2  - Today water supply issue in large cities seems to be a big
problem. This becomes more important with population
growth and urbanization extension. To cope with this problem
lots of irrigation and drainage projects have been implemented
and operated that subsequently many socio- economic and
cultural effects have been brought to the areas . The objective of
the present study is to survey the socio - economic and environmental
effects of Taleghan dam to compare the two periods before and
after the dam construction. The needed data have been gathered
by use of a questionnaire and by interviewing 400 samples in the
irrigation and drainage network’s region of Taleghan Dam, and
encoded questions and outcome data have been analyzed in spss
and lisrel software. The results showed an economic development
in the region, but some factors like, lack of trust, lack of economic
advantages and deficiency of facilities, decrease villagers’
willingness to invest. 63.3% of region’s environmental pollution
has been increased mainly by the tourists. Not only is there no increase
in Water sources but also they have been decreased. 98%

N2  - China’s water resources are scarce. Given its limited water resource, policies in China have been traditionally focused on meeting sectoral demands for water by increasing the supply rather than managing demand. However, effective water resource policies that focus on demand management and encourage efficient water use remain the main weakness of China’s water policy. Main potential for efficiency gain is the agricultural sector, which accounts for 65 percent of the nation’s total water withdrawals. Due to major inefficiencies in irrigation water systems only about 45 percent of water withdrawals for agriculture are actually used by farmers to irrigate their crops. In addition to inefficiencies, the equity of the agricultural water policies is questionable, That is, existing policies lead to an inequitable allocation across different parts of the basin and within a given irrigation system. Designing policies that are both efficient and equitable is a challenge that has yet to be met. 
In this paper we explore the potential for an improvement in policies that address water use efficiency and equity in one of China’s rural regions. 
A spatial water allocation model is employed to maximize water use efficiency at both public water conveyance system and private on-farm water use in one of the irrigation districts in Northwest China’s Shaanxi Province. First-hand data which were collected from our field survey will be used in the water allocation model. Water is provided by a government authority via a public canal to farmers. Water use efficiency is modeled along with efficient and optimal cropping patterns to be endogenously determined by the decision makers in the region. The public water conveyance system has a given efficiency that can be improved with investment to reduce deep percolation. This can be done either by farmers or through cost sharing arrangements between farmers and the government. Pumping water from the canal is not regulated and sequencing of the farmers along the canal dictates the amount of water to be used by each farmer. Under the unregulated case equity may be the lowest, where the upstream users may pump unrestricted amounts and the downstream users may use the remainder. Increased efficiency of the public canal may lead to more available water to the upstream users. In a parallel venue, when on-farm efficiency is improved, less water is returned to the aquifer, leaving less water as a return flow to be available to the downstream users. Hence equity is always an issue whenever efficiency is improved.
Specifically in our study area farmers’ lands are covered by one irrigation authority and situated along a canal. All farmers have access to public canal water and groundwater. For those situated at plain area, where winter wheat is grown, they have better access to abundant and cheap public canal water. For those farmers living at hilly, higher elevation area, where apple production is dominating, they get water from public canal with a higher price of about 40% compared with the price their counterparts at the plain area due to an additional (stage 1 station) lift-height pumping cost. At last, water will be delivered to mountainous area where corn is grown. A stage 2 lift-height pumping station lifts the water again to irrigate the corn’s fields. Consequently the water price is doubled as compared to the original water price at the plain area. Corn needs less water than wheat and apple. Farmers may reduce their water costs either by reducing canal water application, and groundwater pumping, or by dry land farming. A canal controller or examiner will be introduced to the canal management. By doing so, the policy impacts of regulated and unregulated cases are analyzed. 
Our framework includes water use efficiency, water pricing and various policy interventions that are aimed at both increasing total welfare and improve income distribution along the canal. We show how important it is for the public agency and the private users to cooperate in order to achieve water use efficiency and equity within the irrigation network. Policies include various water pricing schemes, the unregulated case, increased monitoring and enforcement of various water allocation methods, cost sharing arrangements, side payments, and trade in water rights (that will be allocated by the government). A General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) is employed to achieve the optimization process under the water system constraints and other policy regulation constraints.

N1  - Presented at the 19th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Washington DC, USA
N2  - Developing countries identify a set of strategic objectives to promote agricultural production, and assure food security and reduced level of poverty. Two of these objectives are (i) sustainable increase in agricultural productivity, and (ii) accelerated agricultural commercialization. Each of these objectives is backed-up by a long-list of priority investment areas. However, most of these countries cannot satisfy the financial and technical requirements to execute both of the strategic objectives and all of these investment areas. In light of this, taking the case of Ethiopia as an example, this study employs an economy-wide model and assesses the relative efficiency of alternative investment options on agricultural performance and poverty reduction. Results show that the policy instruments cause significantly different production and welfare responses. Productivity enhancing interventions such as input subsidy and irrigation provision have superior welfare consequences, while policies aimed at small holder commercialization have the least effect.

N2  - Physical infrastructure development is a powerful means of promoting economic growth as (i) it
creates production facilities, “crowds in” private investment and thereby stimulates economic activities,
(ii) reduces transaction and marketing costs, improving competitiveness, and (iii) provides employment
opportunities to the poor. Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) supported irrigation projects
help provide the necessary impetus for infrastructure development, thereby aiding in capital formation.
Evaluation of irrigation investments under RIDF in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa,
Maharashtra and Assam has revealed that the investments are economically viable. The net benefits
realised by the user community from the investments in irrigation have been found fairly high, except
in Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. Full benefits of medium irrigation projects in Uttar Pradesh could not be
realised due to pending rehabilitation work and scanty rainfall. Similarly, non-completion of canal
works in Orissa has adversely affected the returns to investment. The study has observed that adequate
maintenance through budgetary provisions and/or through levying of user charges would ensure
sustainability of benefits. It has suggested that creation of Water Users Associations (WUAs), envisaged
under RIDF, would help in effective water distribution, maintenance and collection of water charges.

N2  - This paper aims to analyze whether Brazilian smallholder farmers who adopt irrigation methods would be 
more resilient to climate change when compared to smallholders producing rainfed crops. We developed a treatment 
effects model, based in the Propensity Score Matching technique, which can explain irrigation adoption and net 
revenues simultaneously. Temperature and precipitation projections for 2010-2099 were used considering different 
climate scenarios according to the 4th Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Results 
confirmed the efficiency of irrigation as an adaptive strategy. For all simulation scenarios, land values of irrigators 
are, on average, approximately twice the value of rainfed smallholders. It can be concluded that there is need of public 
policies focused on developing strategies to cope with global warming effects in the agricultural sector. Moreover, 
given the importance of irrigation adoption as an adaptive measure, it is needed to encourage the expansion of credit 
lines for irrigation investments, especially for less capitalized farmers.

N2  - Climate change across the U.S. Corn Belt will significantly increase precipitation variability and temperatures by midcentury. Corn and soybean producers will seek to find strategies that may help to mitigate the potentially negative effects on yield. The adoption of irrigation technology has increased over the last several decades to improve yields in areas with insufficient rainfall, and is currently being adopted by producers who are choosing to minimize risk due to weather variability. To see if this trend in irrigation adoption has the potential to expand in the wake of climate change, this study uses weather data, crop yields, and water use from four General Circulation Models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and crop models to evaluate the profitability of the irrigation investment. The data drives Net Present Value and internal rate of return calculations of investment in irrigation equipment for the present (1980-2005) and midcentury (2040-2070). 
The Net Present Value of irrigation investment for midcentury producers is largely driven by the yield response to irrigation by soybeans under future climate conditions. While the irrigation of corn is profitable in some locations, namely the western Corn Belt, the locations where irrigating corn in the future is largely the same as in the contemporary period. Under future weather conditions, the area where irrigating soybeans becomes profitable is greatly expanded, likely due to CO2 fertilization effects and higher temperatures in the northern Corn Belt. Projected irrigation water demand increases across the entire Corn Belt, both from a relative increase in applications from current irrigators, and an increase in the total number of irrigators across the central and eastern Corn Belt. The increase in profitability for irrigation, and the potential increases in water demanded has important policy implications for the future, in order to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change while ensuring water supplies are available and safe for the future.

N2  - Considering different scenarios of future trends in climate, several authors have found that the impact that climate change will have on agriculture will most likely be negative. Most of these studies consider regions with low level of irrigation and do not control for purchased farm inputs. An important step towards understanding the evolution of agricultural production is to carefully estimate the effect that different temperatures and precipitation have on agricultural productivity considering also inputs under farmers control and the farmers profit-maximizing behavior. This research develops a county level biomass production function for an 800-mile climatic gradient from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River (41N). Our results quantify the critical effects that high temperatures have on agricultural productivity in the region, after controlling for irrigation, other managed inputs, soil characteristics, precipitation, and technological change. We find a negative and increasing (nonlinear) effect of temperatures over 30 C on crop yields; a full day of temperatures between 30 C and 35 C decreases expected yield by 1.7% and a day of temperatures over 35 C decreases yields by 23.1%. In addition, converting rainfed crops to irrigated crop will produce a sharp decrease in the negative impact of the higher temperature interval.

N2  - Irrigation is increasingly seen as a necessary means to build resilience in smallholder rain-fed farming systems and to increase productivity to meet growing food demands in Sub-Saharan Africa. Irrigation was important in the Asian Green Revolution. Abundant surface and ground water and the under-exploited irrigation potentials offer real prospects for expanding irrigation in several SubSaharan African countries, Zambia inclusive. However, there are still several gaps—the known unknowns: what irrigation models work and are suitable for smallholder farmers in the context of climate change? What irrigation models are preferred and why? What are the likely impacts of climate change on water availability and what are the long-term implications for irrigation development? This study contributes towards filling these gaps. First, it assesses what smallholder irrigation models are present in Zambia and their performance. Second, it analyses the prevalence of irrigation use among smallholder farmers, what drives its use and the impacts and implications of current and projected climate change on water resource availability in the country. Combining qualitative field interviews, econometric and hydrological modelling, the main results suggest that public-private partnership and privately managed irrigation schemes are better models for smallholder irrigation schemes provided that farmers retain a sense of ownership of the scheme, have good governance structures and are well organized into collective production and marketing units with production financing and forward supply contract arrangements. While community-based schemes have the potential, they are usually too small and farmers are often poorly organized to get into formalized collective production and marketing arrangements. Public-private partnerships such as the three-tier model (combining a large-scale farm to supply water and provide market to medium- and small-scale farmers) hold potential, but it is still too soon to evaluate them. Albeit successful, outgrowing arrangements under private irrigation schemes create winners and losers, as they often entail significant changes to the ways land, livelihoods, and social relations are configured. Informal irrigation for fruits and vegetables is more prevalent at 18% use rate than for field crops (ca.1%) among smallholder farmers in Zambia. The majority of the irrigated fields are located close to water sources (Dambos/wetlands) and manual bucket irrigation is the most prevalent irrigation technology used by more than 80% of smallholder farmers. In addition to proximity to water sources, access to credit, labour availability, secure land tenure and income are strong drivers for irrigation use among smallholder farmers. With climate projections suggesting that Zambia will become hotter and drier, and the southern, western and eastern regions much more affected compared to the northern region, water scarcity can only worsen. Reduced rainfall and a hotter climate coupled with increased demand for water resources will require smallholder irrigators to adapt in some ways. Water scarcity will increasingly make it difficult for irrigators to rely on Dambos/wetlands. How exactly the irrigators will adapt largely depends on their location in the country, proximity to water sources, resilience and adaptive capacity, inter alia. Based on the main results, we draw the following implications on smallholder irrigation development in Zambia: Current and future smallholder irrigation schemes will need to adopt more water efficient technologies such as overhead and drip irrigation systems as opposed to the prevalent surface irrigation methods. It is vital to understand the cost implications and feasibility of such a switch to more water efficient technologies. Governance and institutional arrangements of smallholder irrigation schemes will need strengthening to facilitate collective production and marketing arrangements. Reduced water availability will increase access and irrigation costs, which in turn may reduce its profitability among smallholder farmers as they tend to have limited capital and capacity to adapt to higher cost structures. In this vein, improved access to credit facilities and markets will be required. Competition for the reduced available water resources will disadvantage the smallholder farmers. Policies to protect them against the large-scale users are required. This may entail strengthening the management, regulation, and monitoring of water use by ensuring that water user rights and fees become mandatory and are enforced, and the process of acquiring water rights transparent. Activities of Water Management Authorities require strengthening.

N2  - With growing competition for water, increased environmental constraints and a weak economic picture for agriculture, there has been growing concern about the future of the irrigation industry in both the western United States and the prairie provinces of Canada. In this paper I argue that irrigation research is a major reason the industry has successfully weathered troubled times in the past and that a properly focused research program can also be very helpful in addressing future challenges. I further argue, however, that the research programs in both the United States and Canada must be refocused if we are to effectively and efficiently meet these challenges.

N2  - Depleting water resources is a widespread problem across the Kansas High Plains aquifer. The value of irrigation is accentuated due to lack of surface water and low precipitation in western Kansas. Accelerated groundwater withdrawals for irrigation caused a further decline in the saturated thickness of the aquifer. To encourage water conservation and reduce further depletion of the aquifer, federal and state cost-share programs have subsidized irrigation technology upgrades. However, this effort may have been undermined by producers who increased their water usage for irrigation with water-intensive crops. A simulation model comprised of an irrigation scheduling tool coupled with a crop yield simulator are used to predict risk-efficient crop and technology choices, which allows us to estimate the effect of an irrigation technology upgrade on the aquifer. This research characterizes producers’ decisions to maintain economic viability while adapting to limited irrigation conditions. The study will identify the conditions under which technology upgrades will both save water and increase farmers’ returns from irrigation. The study also estimates the threshold payments to farmers to switch to relatively less water-intensive crops that will promote water conservation on the High Plains aquifer.

N2  - The possible impacts of projected climate change on Australian agriculture
are outlined. The characteristics of climate change that underpin the
creation of economic impacts for agriculture are also described and
discussed. Climate change is shown to generate spatially and temporally
diverse impacts, with many regions likely to experience increased downside
risk in agricultural production. Some regions, such as south-west Australia,
are projected to be particularly at risk of adverse outcomes associated with
climate change.
The likely gradual unfolding of climate change, however, may provide
farmers in many regions and industries with sufficient time to utilise or
develop adaptation strategies. Many of these strategies are likely to be
based on farmers’ current responses to climate variability. Investment in
R&amp;D and innovation are likely to be important ingredients in facilitating
farmers’ adaptation to climate change.
Farmers are likely to face additional costs of capital adjustment due to
climate change and investment in long-lived climate-dependent agricultural
assets such as irrigation infrastructure, new vineyards and timber
plantations will become more problematic. Investing in ecological assets in
rural regions, especially where these assets may become stranded by
climate change, is also increasingly made problematic.

N2  - Demand for food staples particularly rice has been increasing tremendously especially in Sub-Saharan Africa relative to supply attributed by a continued rise in population. The shortfall in supply is generally considered to be caused by low use of inputs particularly inorganic fertilizer and improved seed among others. Meanwhile, there is limited empirical evidence to support this notion. This paper aimed at estimating the profitability and yield response to inorganic fertilizer and improved rice seed using cross-section data collected from 256 smallholder rice farmers in Mbarali district -Tanzania. Data was analysed using treatment effect model while instrumental variable was used for robustness check. Results shows that inorganic fertilizer use in the study area is not low as generalized by previous studies. It was further revealed that increasing fertilizer and seed use by 1 kg leads to an increase in yield by 6.2 kgha-1 and 9.2 kgha-1 respectively. Furthermore, rice production is a profitable business though low marginal physical product and high fertilizer price significantly reduce the profitability of fertilizer use. Thus, reducing input costs through well-managed subsidy programs, timely accessibility of inputs coupled with irrigation facilities and good agronomic practices are crucial for sustainable and profitable agricultural development.

N2  - Intersectoral and interstate conflicts over the use of limited water and energy resources
are aggravating in all arid regions throughout the world, and particularly in the Aral Sea basin of Central Asia. Tremendous expansion of the irrigated areas to produce cotton starting from the 1960s led to a heavy dependence of the economies on irrigated agriculture. Irrigation development reduced environmental flows in the basin and caused a gradual desiccation of the Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake in the world. The emergence of the five independent Central Asian states in the current territory of the Aral Sea Basin, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, added new challenges for sharing basin resources.
The resume of construction of Rogun dam, with a height of more than 300 m and active
storage of over 10 km3, by Tajikistan in 2008 in the Vakhsh tributary of the Amu Darya
River in upstream of Nurek reservoir led to fierce intergovernmental debates. Tajikistan
intends to increase its national energy security and to gradually grow export revenues from electricity generation through this project with a maximum electricity generation capacity of 3600 MW. The country argues that the construction of the dam also increases water availability to downstream regions. In contrast, downstream Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are concerned that inappropriate operation of the reservoirs by the upstream country may substantially harm irrigation benefits that are essential for the livelihoods of the majority of the population in these two countries.
Despite many debates and controversial arguments by both parties over the results of
the construction of the dam its impact of Rogun Dam on agricultural production and
livelihoods in the downstream regions has not been assessed in detail. This study uses
an integrated hydro-economic model to address the potential impact of Rogun Dam on
downstream water availability and irrigation benefits.

N2  - A significant increase in the global demand of animal products is expected in the near future, because of
evolving food consumption patterns in emerging countries. To fulfil the needs, a “Livestock Revolution”
should occur and it will have to target in priority smallholder farms in developing countries, as they are
the main actors in supply chains of milk and meat. To achieve such an increase in milk yield and live
weight gain within numerous farms, new tools of intervention have to be tested. In fact, in many
developing countries, State services are currently withdrawing from their traditional support to farmers,
and therefore innovative methods should be set-up. They will also require a more responsible implication
of the stakeholders in supply chains, particularly with well organized farmers’ associations. In areas
characterized by water stress and climate change, this should be a top priority issue in the agenda of
agricultural development institutions. As livestock production involves many processes from water to
forage biomass elaboration and dietary rations conceptions, it is generally acknowledged that it
necessitates important volumes of water. In this article, an example of an intervention research is
presented from the Tadla irrigation scheme (centre of Morocco) as an illustration of intensive cattle
production in a context of irrigation in a semi arid region (less than 300 mm of annual rainfall). Results
related to follow-ups of water productivity through cattle farming and trials to increase the average milk
yield per cow are presented. A reflection on the possibilities to use "virtual water" and on the generalisation of such methods to a whole population of dairy farmers in a supply basin (i.e. an irrigation
scheme) is finally developed with its consequences on the economic sustainability of smallholder units.
Thus, a capacity building process is urgently required to upgrade farmers’ performances. This will induce
the adoption of sound on-farm practices, from irrigation systems to soil fertility management and forage
biomass production. It will also rely on the continuous design of balanced dietary rations for lactating cows and their impacts on cattle load (number of cattle per ha of forage). Finally, more attention should be paid to the existing farmers’ co-operatives, which would constitute crucial operators in disseminating innovation processes to face the challenges of water shortage in cattle production systems.

N2  - The purpose of this report is to show the process of the intervention made through the implementation of the IWRM and Food Security Demonstration Project in Zambia. The report gives details of the project processes, showing the steps the project went through, the outcomes and its impact on the communities where it was implemented. The report is the result of a number of field visits made to the completed project sites, the sources of information have been; focus group meetings, interviews, discussions with key informants, beneficiaries the youth, male and female stakeholders and reviews of project activity reports, and direct observations. Therefore, what is presented here is a cumulative “factual and real time” opinion as to what has been observed and discussed.
The Project was implemented over a period of two years in the three sites of the Kafue River Basin in the Central and Southern Provinces respectively. Katuba is at the Northern Bank of the Kafue River on the Mwembeshi River, a tributary of the Kafue River. Namwala is at the Southern Bank of the Kafue River, with Namwala River pouring its waters in the Kafue and meandering around the plains. The Kafue River Basin covers the Copper Belt Province in the North Western part of the country. Katuba is in Chibombo district and in the chiefdom of Mungule. In Namwala district, the project has been implemented in Mungaila and Mukobela Chiefdoms respectively. The report highlights some of the successes achieved by the intervention and some of the challenges faced by the target communities and recommends the way-forward to the sustainable management of water resources by the communities. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the benefits of applying the IWRM principles and practices to reduce poverty and improve quality of life of the people through economic empowerment.

N2  - Based on the data of rural households in the Loess Plateau of China, this paper uses exploratory factor analysis to measure the degree of participation of farmers in collective action from the information, participation, organization and effect of action. Through Bootstrap mediation effect test, this paper tests the direct impact of land transfer area and period on farmers implementation of soil and water conservation measures, and the indirect impact of transfer area and period on the implementation of soil and water conservation measures by changing the participation of farmers in collective action. The result shows: transfer area has a direct impact on the using of terraced fields, plastic film and afforestation. The transfer period has a direct impact on the implementation of terraced fields, plastic film, afforestation and water-saving irrigation techniques. While collective action plays a mediating role in the process of transfer area affecting farmers use of terraced fields, afforestation and water-saving irrigation techniques, its mediating role in the use of plastic film is not significant. While the mediating role of collective action is significant in the transfer period affecting the implementation of terraced field and water-saving irrigation techniques, it is not significant in using plastic film and afforestation.

These case studies provide up-to-date knowledge and critical insights on the nexus of land degradation, climate change and energy in the Sahel. The current synthesis paper highlights their major findings and provides crosscutting and cross-regional analytical conclusions. First, the synthesis paper explores current trends in the Sahel region on land use and land degradation, energy use and supply, climate change projections and impacts, as well as their interactions and links to agricultural growth, food security, poverty reduction, and peace in the region. Second, technological, socio-economic and policy solutions at the nexus of land, water, energy and climate challenges that enable environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive rural development in the Sahel are discussed, including their interactions and implications for peace and stability in the region. The findings show that such socio-economic solutions as improving access to markets, strengthening social safety nets, increasing investments to transport and energy infrastructures, promoting land tenure security, expanding off-farm employment opportunities can greatly contribute to rural development in the Sahel, particularly by aiding climate change resilience and sustainable land management. Key technological innovations highlighted across the case studies include expanding irrigation and adopting water use efficient irrigation techniques, crop diversification, expanding agricultural mechanization, investing into restoring and rehabilitating degraded lands through reforestation, afforestation and agroforestry practices. The key lessons learnt from ongoing national policy initiatives for sustainable development highlight the importance of active stakeholder consultation and participation in policy formulation, institution of effective policy monitoring and assessment mechanisms, and avoiding of excessive reliance on external sources of funding for the successful implementation of sustainable development policies and programs. Based on these findings, the synthesis paper proposes an agenda for applied research to provide guidance to and accompany promising development strategies in and for the region.

N2  - Living customary water tenure is the most accepted socio-legal system among the large majority of rural people in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on literature, this report seeks to develop a grounded understanding of the ways in which rural people meet their domestic and productive water needs on homesteads, distant fields or other sites of use, largely outside the ambits of the state. Taking the rural farming or pastoralist community as the unit of analysis, three components are distinguished. The first component deals with the fundamental perceptions of the links between humankind and naturally available water resources as a commons to be shared by all, partially linked to communities’ collective land rights. The second component deals with the sharing of these finite and contested naturally available water resources, especially during dry seasons and droughts. Customary arrangements shape both the ‘sharing in’ of water resources within communities and the ‘sharing out’ with other customary communities or powerful third parties. Since colonial times, communities have been vulnerable to those third parties grabbing water resources and overriding customary uses and governance. The third component deals with infrastructure to store and convey water resources. Since time immemorial, communities have invested in infrastructure for self supply, ranging from micro-scale soil moisture retention techniques to large-scale collective deep wells. As increasingly recognized in both the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and irrigation sectors, this component of self supply is rapidly expanding. In all three components, local diversity is high, with gender, class and other social hierarchies intertwining with social safety nets, neighborliness and moral economies. The study derives two sets of implications for state and non-state policies, laws and interventions. First, state legislation about the sharing of water resources should recognize and protect living customary water tenure, especially through due process in ‘sharing out’ water with powerful third parties. Remarkably, water law, which is dominated by permit systems in sub-Saharan Africa, lags behind other legislation in recognizing customary water tenure (see IWMI Research Report 182). Second, by taking communities’ self supply for multiple uses as a starting point for further water infrastructure development, the WASH, irrigation and other sectors can follow the priorities of communities, including the most vulnerable; identify cost-effective multi-purpose infrastructure; develop local skills; and, hence, contribute more sustainably to achieving more United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 13. Further historical and interdisciplinary research to achieve these benefits is recommended.

N2  - This study contributes to the understanding of long- and short- term determinants of cooperation among water users. We experimentally investigate the potential of water users self-governance in enhancing their contributions to a common pool as opposed to external regulation. Our focus is on the irrigated areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Due to their Soviet past, these countries have a reputation for low bottom-up cooperation potential. Based on the different pre-Soviet irrigation traditions of the two study sites, we assess the effectiveness of short-term incentives compared to long term cultural factors of cooperation. History might matter, but we find it does not predetermine the success of current water decentralization in ancient as compared to relatively recently established irrigation sites. We find that external regulation, in fact, decreases farmers cooperation, whereas face-to-face communication increases it. This finding calls into question the top-down approach prevalent in current water policies of the region. Moreover, it suggests the viability of endogenous cooperation and hence encourages the implementation of truly self-governed water management policies in Central Asia. However, the substantial heterogeneity in individual contributions apparent at the village level also signals a warning that one-size-fits-all approaches to local cooperation are unlikely to succeed.

N2  - Predictions demonstrate that climate change is likely to stifle the coffee development program in Uganda at three levels: (i) by reducing survival rate of coffee seedlings to expand coffee acreage; (ii) exacerbate productivity challenges in an inherently constrained rain-fed low input coffee production system; and (iii) contributing to reduction in quality of coffee beans (specifically bean size) produced leading to losses in absolute value in export earnings. This is likely to slow down the low middle-income status by 2020 target of exporting 20 million (60 Kg bags) annually. The farmers’ ownership model piloted by the National Union of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises (NUCAFE), where a smallholder farmer is guaranteed premium prices for value addition, offers a strategy to sustainably invest in climate smart agriculture 1 (involving use of irrigation and fertilizer)1in coffee production.

the 290 million ruminant livestock, have less than 200 mm. Its impact has been
exacerbated in the last half century by the human population increasing yearly at over
3%, while livestock numbers have risen by 50% over the quinquennium.
Virtually no scope exists for further expansion of rainfed farming and very little
for irrigation, hence there is competition between mechanized cereal production and
grazing in the low rainfall areas, and traditional nomadic systems of drought management
through mobility are becoming difficult to maintain. Moreover droughts seem to be
increasing in frequency, and their high social, economic, and environmental costs have
led governments to intervene with various forms of assistance to farmers and herders,
including distribution of subsidized animal feed, rescheduling of loans, investments in
water development, and in animal health.
In this paper we examine the nature and significance of these measures, both with
respect to their immediate benefits and costs to the recipients and to governments, and to
their longer term impact on poverty and the environment. We conclude that while they
have been valuable in reducing catastrophic losses of livestock and thus alleviating
poverty, especially in the low rainfall areas where they are the predominant source of
income, continued dependence on these programs has sent inappropriate signals to
farmers and herders, leading to moral hazards, unsustainable farming practices, and
environmental degradation, while generally benefiting the affluent recipients most.
Moreover, they have tended to escalate and become an administrative and financial
burden to their governments.
Alternative approaches to drought management need to be explored, and
possibilities discussed here include area-based rainfall insurance against catastrophic
droughts, and the development of more accurate timely, and accessible early warning
drought forecasts. While we envisage the insurance as an unsubsidized private sector
initiative with a number of attractive features, it would require strong support from the
government in its formative stages. Improved weather forecasts are likely to remain a
government responsibility in the immediate future and would help administrators and
relief agencies position themselves for more efficient drought interventions, as well as
farmers to adjust their plans to rainfall outcomes.

N2  - Agriculture development has been the main strategy for the socioeconomic development in the country since time immemorial, even though its contribution to GDP has been declining recently. Successive governments of Sri Lanka since independence have invested heavily in the irrigated agriculture sector to address the food security concerns of the country. The continuous investment in irrigation was required to address problems such as spatial and temporal variations in monsoonal rainfall in the country, which has a serious negative impact on food production and livelihoods of people. The need for pursuing irrigation development and management has become more important in the country in the face of rapid population growth and increasing food prices in the world market. In this context, managing irrigation schemes for productivity increase is becoming increasingly important and different irrigation management models have also emerged through attempts made in this direction by countries including Sri Lanka, where irrigation plays a leading role in food production and nation development. Farmers’ active involvement in irrigation management, especially operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and decision-making as well, has been identified as a key requirement to attain productivity goals and the sustainability of irrigation systems. This paper aims at reviewing participatory irrigation management approaches adopted in medium and major irrigation systems in Sri Lanka with a view to identifying their past and present trends and future directions. The review will contribute to an improved understanding by policymakers, managers of irrigation schemes and farmers of the role of participatory irrigation management, its past and present including institutional structures, responsibilities and performance and the directions it should take to meet future challenges as a dynamic institutional mechanism. As all the medium and major irrigation schemes in the country are jointly managed by farmers and government agencies, the inferences drawn from the review would be important for the agencies and farmers alike to introduce necessary changes in their programs to address future needs and requirements.

N2  - Large expenses associated with rice production and dependence on energy related inputs like fuel and fertilizer in particular compel rice producers to use management practices that are input efficient and result in least cost. This study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to calculate technical efficiency (TE), allocative efficiency (AE), and economic efficiency (EE) for rice production in Arkansas at the field level using data from 137 fields enrolled in the University of Arkansas, Rice Research Verification Program (RRVP) from 2005 to 2011. Efficiency scores for RRVP fields are compared with those obtained from developing rice producing countries. Economic efficiency scores are also compared across RRVP fields using alternative management practices. The results indicate the majority of RRVP fields have high TE scores with a mean TE score of 0.899. Over half the fields in the RRVP achieve full technical efficiency (TE scores equal to 1). Mean AE and EE scores for RRVP fields (AE = 0.696; EE = 0.625) fall within the range of mean AE and EE scores reported for developing countries producing rice. Alternative management practices appear to have an impact EE scores. Fields planted to hybrid, Clearfield-hybrid combinations, and medium grain varieties along with fields with a zero-grade and fields using multiple inlet irrigation produced higher EE scores relative to other RRVP fields.

N2  - Since the passage of the 1996 Farm Act, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has provided over $10 billion in technology adoption subsidies. One of the national conservation priorities in EQIP is water conservation, but it is not known how participation in EQIP by irrigators affects water application rates and decisions to expand or reduce a farm’s irrigated acreage. Using a farm-level panel data set drawn from three national samples of irrigators taken in 1998, 2003, and 2008, this study provides the first national scale econometric estimates of the changes in water application rates and irrigated acreage that result when a farm receives EQIP payments. Due to a five-fold increase in EQIP funding following the 2002 farm bill, the change in EQIP participation between 2008 and earlier years is largely the result of an exogenous policy shock. A difference-in-differences estimator that exploits this change in EQIP funding and also controls for unobserved farm-specific variables, suggests that for the average farm participating in EQIP between 2004 and 2008, the EQIP payments may have reduced water application rates but also may have increased total water use and led to an expansion in irrigated acreage. However, since EQIP participation is voluntary, there may still be a need to correct for bias due to sample selection. A nearest neighbor matching estimator finds no evidence of any statistically significant effect of EQIP participation on technology adoption rates, water use, water application rates or acreages, which suggests that there is a high degree of self-selection into the program.

N2  - This paper discusses emerging water crisis in India with the business as usual water use patterns and ways
of averting it. Increasing reliance on groundwater has been contributing to pockets of unsustainable water use in
many basins. This trend is likely to continue and many river basins will face severe regional water crisis in the next
half century. However, proper understanding of the negative impacts of downstream water users, artificial recharge
of groundwater could facilitate sustainable water use. Increasing water use efficiency, reducing uncontrolable
pumping, increasing water productivity and crop diversification could help in mitigating the groundwater related
water crisis. Growth in industrial, services and domestic sectors, water demand in the future shall outpace additional
irrigation. This, coupled with increasing desire for a clean and reliable water supply in these sectors, and increasing
focuses on environmental water needs shall demand large intra-or inter-basin water transfers

N2  - [Objectives] To study the impact of heavy metal pollution of soil and plants during the process of reclaimed water for irrigation of green land in arid areas and the potential health risks to humans during use. [Methods] Taking Zhongwei City in Ningxia, a typical arid area, as the research area, the irrigation water, soil and green grass in the reclaimed water irrigation region and the original green water irrigation region were sampled, the heavy elements Hg, As, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr were detected, and the Nemerow method, biological absorption coefficient, and health risk assessment were employed to evaluate the degree of soil pollution, plant absorption capacity, and human health risks. [Results] Compared with the original green water, the Hg, Cd, and Cr pollution of the reclaimed water irrigated green land was higher, the As, Zn, Pb pollution was lower, and the content of Hg and Cd was higher than the environmental background values of soil in Ningxia; the Cr content exceeded the risk intervention values of the first type of land in the Soil Environmental Quality -- Risk Control Standard for Soil Contamination of Development Land (GB36600-2018). Compared with the original green water irrigation region, it is found that the reclaimed water irrigation reduced the heavy metal pollution of the soil to a certain extent. The heavy metal content of tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea) in the reclaimed water irrigation region was Zn, Cr, Pb, As, Cd, and Hg from high to low; the order of the biological absorption coefficient was Cd&gt;As&gt;Zn&gt;Pb&gt;Hg&gt;Cr; irrigation water exerted a certain effect on the content of heavy metals in plants and the biological absorption coefficient through the soil. Using the health risk assessment method recommended by Environmental Protection Agency of the United States of America (USEPA), it was found that the reclaimed water has the highest risk through the inhalation route, and the occupational population has a higher risk of skin contact with soil and plants. [Conclusions] This study is intended to provide data support and theoretical basis for the environmental safety risk research of the application of reclaimed water in arid areas to urban greening.

N2  - Small irrigation schemes have become very popular in many African countries as a policy measure to boost agriculture and farm income given their relatively low capital investment compared with to large irrigation infrastructures and the shorter time required for the project design and implementation. This paper attempts to explore the likely impacts of a program of small irrigation development in Niger on land allocation, agricultural production, food security and poverty reduction on a nationally representative sample of farm households. A farm-household model, named FSSIM-Dev (Farm System Simulator for Developing Countries), is used to achieve this objective. This static positive programming model was applied to every individual farm household included in the 2011-2012 LSMS-ISA survey sample – around 2300 farm households – in order to guarantee the highest representativeness of the farming systems and to capture the full heterogeneity across farm households. Results show that irrigation has a large impact on agriculture production and income of smallholder farmers, mainly during the dry season and in the regions with high potential irrigable land. Farm income would increase by around 7 % at country level if small irrigation was made available to all farmers. At the regional and individual farm levels the impact is more pronounced (reaching more than 80 % in one region). Additionally, the income impacts are larger for those households with the lowest agricultural income in the baseline, showing the large potential impacts of small irrigation in terms of poverty and inequality reduction.

N2  - Climate change and heat stress are expected to worsen the issue of water scarcity that is affecting the agricultural sector, among others through increased crop prices and costs, in addition to changes in yields. A crop-mix optimisation model was developed that maximises Egypt’s net revenue while lightening the impacts of climatic change throughout the study period – from 2013 to 2030. The optimal cropping pattern was obtained through iteration of the model on an annual basis using the projected values of the following variables: yield, arable land, costs, prices and consumptive water use. The model is restricted by sets of constraints concerning water and land availability. These variables were projected under different climate-change scenarios using various modelling techniques. The model improves the cropping pattern in Egypt by favouring crops that achieve high profitability while using a small amount of water for irrigation and crops that have a comparative advantage in the above-mentioned variables, while decreasing all crops that are nonprofitable, that use a large amount of water for irrigation, and that are heat intolerant. As a result, the total net revenue is expected to double at the end of the term. The system of models integrated in this study establishes a platform for decision makers to examine different strategies and policies.

N2  - To mitigate potential impacts from the increasing maintained residential landscapes to the environment, state and local governments and water management organizations are interested in policies that promote resource-efficient landscaping practices by individual homeowners. Incentives including rebates, tax returns, and low rate financing, are common monetary instruments used to promote the adoption of eco-friendly equipment or practices (e.g., water-saving appliances). However, the effects of monetary incentives on homeowners’ preferences for alternative landscapes are less understood. Using discrete choice experimentation, this study investigated homeowners’ preferences for rebate incentive programs and willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative landscape attributes. The results reveal that homeowners are willing to pay a premium for rebate programs, and that the environmental benefit information improves homeowners’ preference and WTP for alternative landscape attributes. Also, we clustered homeowners into low, medium, and high rebate preference groups, which allowed investigating the difference in WTP estimates for alternative landscape attributes. Results estimated by mixed logit in WTP space model revealed that homeowners in high rebate preference group assign higher weights to economic attributes, such as rebate and maintenance, while homeowners in the low rebate preference group give more importance to environmental friendly attributes such as smart irrigation or pollinator friendly habitat. The results offer implications for policy makers as they develop water conservation programs.

N2  - The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) spent the latter
decades of the 20th century fully integrating the surface and sub-surface drainage
systems with the water distribution network in northern Victoria, thereby enabling
complete recycling of outfalls, leaks and seepage from its channels. Yet in 2007, in
repudiation of this recycling capacity, DSE announced a multibillion dollar
modernisation project it claims will “create” 450 GL of “new water” by reducing
“inefficiencies” in the channel distribution system.
Examination of the northern Victorian irrigation supply system shows it was fully
integrated with more than adequate recycling capacity before the project began. In a
classic case of double counting, DSE was already delivering the illusory “new water”
to regional irrigators and billing them for it. Thus the project cannot deliver real
water savings and the Government must effectively reduce irrigation entitlement to
increase entitlements for urban consumption and environmental flows.
The financial and economic impact of bogus water savings on stakeholders is
discussed in terms of the opportunity cost of appropriated irrigation entitlement and
of the effect of overcapitalisation of the distribution system on annual capital charges
and thus the viability of irrigation and the operating water authority.

N2  - Wastewater use in agriculture is a complex phenomenon since it transcends typical sectoral and geographical policy and planning boundaries, and is influenced by opinions and perceptions. Planning for wastewater use typically requires the involvement of a number of government agencies covering health, water, sanitation, agriculture and irrigation, as well as researchers, community groups and the private sector. Where wastewater use is already taking place spontaneously and unofficially, how can these stakeholders come together to improve the management of the system to maximize the livelihoods benefits while minimizing impacts on health and the environment? One option is the formation of multi-stakeholder platforms, which provide a space for stakeholders to share opinions and seek negotiated solutions in an open and ‘level’ environment. How effective these are, what outcomes can be expected, and how they can be improved are all questions that are still being asked. This chapter presents three case studies in which multi-stakeholder processes were used to improve wastewater management for urban agriculture. Although differences were observed, there were several cross-cutting lessons. A critical factor is the starting point, including an agreed definition of the problem to be addressed, negotiated goals and a management structure that is acceptable to all stakeholders. When multi-stakeholder processes are externally initiated, as with those reviewed here, it is essential that project priorities are commensurate with local priorities. Finding an institutional home and anchor agency an improve long-term sustainability but care must be taken in considering how this impacts on existing power structures. Participation and representation greatly influence the effectiveness of the process and much may need to be done to support this, for example by strengthening local community groups. A factor that appears to significantly improve participation and engagement is having tangible outputs, which demonstrate to stakeholders the potential of multi-stakeholder platforms.

N2  - For an individual irrigator water use efficiency increases in response to investments in on-farm capital. Sustainable river systems require sufficient flows to maintain the value and function of natural capital assets. In constrained water resource settings, federal basin managers may view on-farm capital investments as a policy objective to rebalance water shares between all users to offset negative externalities from over allocation. This paper uses a state contingent modelling approach to review an extended farm capital investment policy in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin. We examine technical efficiency gain implications for irrigation and environmental water managers under alternative states of inflow variability and the role increasing climatic uncertainty has on policy objectives. Results suggest that the incentives provided to recover environment water via on-farm capital investments could have two principal negative feedbacks given future uncertainties. First, farm capital investments may encourage inflexible production systems that fail to respond to future water scarcity, exposing that investment to increased risk. Second, technical efficiency gains may reduce return flows leading to perverse policy outcomes to achieve environmental objectives. By highlighting these ulterior policy outcomes it provides both irrigators and policy makers the capacity to adapt and increase their flexibility to develop robust policy and management solutions to help negate future uncertainty.

N2  - The Sahel is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the world. Located in the central part, Niger is facing many complex and interconnected challenges which strongly hinder the achievement of the key sustainable development goals (SDGs). The high population growth rate (3.8% per year), weak infrastructure capacity, shortage of essential resources (including water, energy, food) coupled with the adverse impacts of variability and climate change threaten the population and reduce the country’s economic growth efforts. With more than 77% of landmass area receiving less than 150 mm of precipitation yearly, and about 80% of the population depending on rainfed agriculture, water scarcity and dryness constitute serious constraints for the agriculture and livestock sectors. In addition, the unequal distribution of agricultural land and livestock worsens the poverty incidence among households, which is characterized by a GINI coefficient of 0.46 and 0.68 for land and livestock respectively. Access to drinking water remains very poor with high disparities between urban (64%) and rural areas (48%). Water sanitation amounting to only 2% in rural and 38% in urban areas, respectively, also remains a great issue. Elsewhere, several drought and flood episodes have negatively impacted agricultural productivity, causing recurrent famines and livestock losses. The situation is exacerbated by the impacts of land degradation, the advancement of desertification and also by climate change and variability threats, which are projected to increase in magnitude, intensity, duration and number over the country under all climate change scenarios. The country’s high potential of renewable and non-renewable groundwater resources can be used for residential, agricultural and industrial purposes to overcome negative climate change impacts. Regarding the energy sector, the country is currently in an undesirable state, with very limited modern energy services (2% of the population), low electricity access (average rate of 18%, with around 10% in rural areas) and high dependency on traditional biomass (77% of primary energy consumption). However, the country is fortunate to have a tremendous amount of energy resources, including fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) and renewables (solar, hydropower, and wind), that can be used to overcome many of the observed challenges and thereby contribute significantly in the achievement of various SDGs, including those related to affordable and clean energy, no poverty, and zero hunger. Indeed, in addition to resources for electricity production, Niger has a large surface water potential in the Niger River, with an average discharge of 6000 m3/s and length of about 550 km, which can be mobilized for irrigation to enable food security. Therefore, socioeconomic development requires an integrated approach that brings all the key sectors into a common framework in order to solve the aforementioned challenges. Hence, in key development areas, several development policies and strategies from government, NGOs, and technical and financial partners have been initiated and implemented for inequality and poverty reduction to improve livelihoods in the country.

N2  - The advent of biotechnology and conservation of genetic resources hold promise to improve traits to meet the challenges to coffee growing from climate change. Developing new varieties by integrating traits in high demand by farmers could greatly increase farmers’ adoption of new varieties. This study aims to inform breeding priority setting by examining farmers’ preferences for coffee traits. A Discrete Choice Experiment was applied to smallholder farmers in northern Ethiopia to map their willingness-to-pay for improvements in four coffee traits: i) yield, ii) weather tolerance, iii) disease resistance, and iv) the maturity period. The traits are important to the farmers in their choice of coffee varieties. They prefer weather tolerant and disease resistant varieties; implying that they prefer yield stability over high yielding and early maturing varieties. Education level, access to irrigation and farmers’ experience in coffee farming explain the preference heterogeneity across farmers. These results suggest that breeding programs should give priority to yield stability in order to increase farmers’ adoption of new varieties, and secure in situ preservation of these traits. Thus, ex situ conservation programs are needed for early maturing and high yielding varieties, which farmers do not give priority to maintain in their own fields. This would improve climate resilience of coffee farming, and at the same time conserve the Arabica coffee genetic heritage of Ethiopia.

N2  - Food security has been a major component of the development policies in Mali since the independence in 1960. The Malian government has adopted several cereal supply strategies since 1960.
First, the government tried interventionist policies from 1960 to 1980. The government set prices and provided inputs and credits to producers. The goal was to supply urban areas with cheap cereal and, at the same time, encourage producers to produce more. The Mali Agricultural Products Office (OPAM) had the official monopoly on the cereal business, as it collected cereal from producers, who were grouped into cooperatives, and distributed it throughout the country. However, this strategy turned out to be a failure, as production decreased and OPAM’s deficits grew. Producers were penalized, as prices were not high enough to cover their production costs. Hence, Mali went from being a major exporter to an importer of cereals.
The government next decided to proceed with liberalizing the market, which developed into an effective strategy of cereal supply. There is now a more competitive cereal market, both in the national and regional markets. The role of the OPAM is limited to the management of the national food security stock and of food aid. The intervention of NGOs for emergency relief now focuses on buying and distributing food or organizing food-for-work programs. Now, prices are no longer stable, but depend on the supply and demand relationship in the market. In real terms, prices are lower now compared to the period prior to the liberalization (reflecting decreases in the cost of marketing). Nevertheless, recent price increases prevent some consumers from meeting their full needs, since their purchasing power is so low. 
Currently, access to food still remains a challenge. There are several problems: the competition in the redistribution markets between national and regional demands bids up prices for local consumers, the low buying power of consumers with low income, the bad quality of roads which makes distribution difficult to isolated areas, and the fluctuation of the supply due to weather instability. As a consequence, the government frequently has to deal with food crisis. This year’s deficit [2005] was due to a rainfall shortage and locust invasion. For the years ahead, several strategies need to be considered These include a pulling together of the different supply structures; creation of consumers’ cooperatives so as to reduce the burden of prices fluctuation; creation of cereal banks in the deficit zones, assistance to producers in managing their surpluses in years of good production; construction of roads to ease distribution; finally, boosting of irrigation and introducing techniques of water harvesting.

Water quality, environment and climate change. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - Climate is changing world-wide, and the science community in Sri Lanka has come up with ample evidence to suggest that the country’s climate has already changed. During 1961-1990 the country’s mean air temperature increased by 0.016 0C per year, and the mean annual rainfall decreased by 144 mm (7 %) compared to the period 1931-1960. In addition, mean annual daytime maximum and mean annual night-time minimum air temperatures increased. However, the bigger question of national importance is what Sri Lanka’s climate will look like in 50 or 100 years and how prepared is the country to face it. Apart from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections at the coarse global scale, few studies have attempted to project future climate scenarios for Sri Lanka and to identify climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, the sea level, the plantation sector, the economy and health. Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change are the least studied areas. This paper reviews the status of climate change research and activities in Sri Lanka with respect to future climate projections, impacts, climate change mitigation and the country’s ability to adapt, and identifies existing knowledge gaps. Messages emerging from this review suggest that Sri Lanka’s mean temperature during the North-East (December-February) and South-West (May-September) monsoon seasons will increase by about 2.9 0C and 2.5 0C, respectively, over the baseline (1961-1990), by the year 2100 with accompanying changes in the quantity and spatial distribution of rainfall. Extreme climate events are expected to increase in frequency. These changes will bring about widespread impacts on the country’s agriculture and economy For example, an increase of 0.5 0C in temperature can reduce rice yield by approximately 6%; extended dry spells and excessive cloudiness during the wet season can reduce coconut yield resulting in annual losses between $32 and $73 million to the economy. Pilot studies in the Galle District suggest that sea level rise could inundate about 20 % of the land area of Galle’s coastal District Secretariat Divisions. Adaptation measures already undertaken in the agriculture sector include the development of low water consuming rice varieties and the use of micro-irrigation technologies. Tools have been developed for predicting seasonal water availability within the Mahaweli Scheme and annual national coconut production. However, Sri Lanka is yet to undertake a comprehensive national study on the vulnerability of her water resources and agriculture to climate change. The formulation of detailed and reliable future climate scenarios for the country is therefore, urgently required.

N2  - The Odessa Sub-area lies in the second, and uncompleted, region of Washington’s Columbia Basin Water Project. Water used for irrigation in the region is currently pumped from as deep as 700 feet, and water access is steadily declining. We measure the economic losses to the potato producing region that would result from further reducing access to water for crop irrigation in the Columbia Basin. Estimated costs are adjusted for the gains in wheat production that would result as affected growers transition their land into the next best non-irrigated crop alternative in the region. Then, we move beyond the standard contribution analysis by looking not only at the net losses in production, but potential forward linked losses from potato processing plant closures.

N2  - For the past two decades, Bangladesh has enjoyed steady growth in per capita incomes enabling a significant reduction in poverty. An increase in rice productivity, achieved through a combination of improved seeds, increased fertilizer use, and public and private investments in irrigation, played a major role in the increase in incomes. Among the other major factors were a large expansion in textile exports, made possible by changes in world demand, Bangladesh trade liberalization, and macro-economic stability; and increases in workers. remittances. In order to accelerate or even maintain income growth rates and poverty reduction, future policies must be carefully designed to capture the benefits and minimize the risks of international trade and a constantly changing international environment. 

A proper assessment of the impact of such policies and economic developments on the poor requires a comprehensive framework to analyze interactions between different sectors as well as linkages between macro and micro levels. In this paper we construct a social accounting matrix for 1999/2000 and develop a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) with special treatment of the rice and wheat sectors. We then present simulations of the effects of (i) rice productivity shocks, (ii) a decline in the world rice price, and (iii) a reduction in RMG exports, reflecting an end to preferential access to RMG markets for Bangladesh goods. 

The simulation results suggest that increases in productivity of rice, a key to the gains in rice production and fall in real rice prices that helped Bangladesh to reduce rural poverty in the last two decades, still have the potential to benefit most households. However, in the absence of intervention in domestic markets, the resulting decline in real rice prices reduces real incomes of larger farmers. If trading links can be established and exports prevent a price fall, however, both producers and consumers enjoy real income gains. Reduced Bangladesh textile (RMG) exports affect all households through the depreciation of the real exchange rate required to offset the decline in export earnings as well as through the overall reduction in labor demand. According to the simulations, a 25 percent decline in RMG export (excluding knitwear) volume would lead to a 6.0 percent decrease in wage payments to unskilled female labor in non-agricultural sectors and a 0.5 to 1.0 percent decline in the real incomes of urban poor households. 

Overall, these simulations illustrate the importance of trade policy and links between Bangladesh and the world economy. International trade offers the potential to prevent a decline in real prices of rice if productivity of paddy production increases and to benefit from increased export earnings. It has also permitted a large increase in RMG export earnings. However, changes in international markets could threaten welfare of some Bangladesh households, as well, as illustrated by the simulations of lower import prices of rice that could sharply reduce farmer incomes, and of a decline in textile export earnings that could sharply reduce female urban employment and urban household incomes. Moreover, the simulations illustrate important general equilibrium considerations that need to be taken into account in policy analysis, including large changes in the real exchange rate needed to avoid an a substantial increase in the current account deficit in the case of a decline in RMG exports. 

Further analysis is needed to better quantify the magnitude of the key linkages with alternative model specifications and parameters, and in different policy scenarios. In addition, work is needed on policy alternatives to offset the potential adverse impacts of declines in terms of trade and export opportunities. Nonetheless, these simulations show that the Bangladesh economy and household incomes are clearly linked with the global economy, particularly through foodgrain trade and the RMG sector. Efforts to alleviate poverty and raise the incomes of the poor should not neglect these linkages, particularly in cases where these poverty alleviation interventions are large enough to have major effects on the real exchange rate and female labor earnings.

N2  - Land use and crop production in the Khorezm region in western Uzbekistan, exemplarily for the irrigated low-lands of Central Asia, is adversely affected by the excessive, non-sustainable use of irrigation water on one hand, repeated droughts on the other hand, and by soil degradation by secondary salinization. One of the research objectives of the German-Uzbek Khorezm project, funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and led by ZEF, is to better understand options for land use and choice of technology at the farm level in order to evaluate and propose technological alternatives and policy options for sustainable land use in Khorezm. To address the latter, the integrated so-called Farm-Level Economic-Ecological Optimization Model (FLEOM) was developed. FLEOM optimizes farm-level land and resource use while at the same time assessing the respective economic and environmental impacts. The model captures the basic features of the regional agriculture and the interrelations of production activities most prevalent to the local farmers. FLEOM builds on an economic farm-household linear-programming (LP) optimization routine and a comprehensive agronomic data base established with the cropping system simulation model, CropSyst. A graphical user-interface programmed in Java provides for easy usability, by which settings and results of FLEOM are visualized in tables and figures or as maps via a GIS-environment. The present discussion paper provides a technical introduction to FLEOM and discusses first application results.

N2  - ORYZA2000: modeling lowland rice is the next in a series of (lowland) rice growth simulation models developed by IRRI and Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR) in the early to mid-1990s in the project "Simulation and Systems Analysis for Rice Production (SARP)." It is an update and integration of the models ORYZA1 for potential production, ORYZA_W for water-limited situations, and ORYZA-N for nitrogen-limited production. Since the release of these models, new insights into crop growth and water-balance processes have been gained, new scientific subroutines developed, and programming standards and tools improved. These developments warranted a new release in the ORYZA series. Besides the scientific and programming updates, ORYZA2000 contains new features that allow a more explicit simulation of crop management options, such as irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer management. It can also be used in application-oriented research such as the design of crop ideotypes and the analysis of yield gaps to the optimization of crop management, the ex ante analysis of the effects of climate change on crop growth, and agroecological zonation.

N2  - Improving the productivity and profitability of farming activity is considered the key pathway out of poverty for many rural households. Agricultural productivity can be achieved through improving technical progress and increasing irrigation practice utilization. The motivation of this study is to figure out the underlying reasons for the low inelastic potato and tomato supply responses in the short and long-run. The paper attempts to estimate the responsiveness of potato and tomato yield and supply to demand, irrigated area, technical progress and industrial policy in Ethiopia. The study uses the error correction model and VARs with the aid of time series data. The results indicate that tomato supply is found to be responsive to demand signal and industrial policy shock in the short run but not to price incentive in the short-run as predicted. Tomato yield is responsive to demand signal, price incentive and industrial policy shock in the short‐run. The numerical magnitude of error correction coefficient for potato yield is 0.88 indicating about 88% of disequilibrium is corrected in a year. The implied departure from equilibrium is about 12%. Interventions in increasing irrigated area and the technical progress in potato and tomato production impact yield and output significantly. The speeds of adjustment towards equilibrium for tomato yield and output are quite fast, it points towards the highest response to technical progress. The results give emphasis to the need to strengthen technical progress and irrigation water supply through effective policies.

N2  - Poverty, being persistent and widespread, still remains core issue to be researched in Nepal. Moreover, there lacks study on dynamic aspects of poverty at the household level. Therefore, this study intends to capture the dynamics of poverty in poverty stricken Far-Western Rural Hill district of Baitadi based on panel data collected through field survey in 2001 and 2007. An empirical analysis is made by employing multinomial logit regression by dividing household into three categories; non-poor, transitory poor, and chronic poor. The results suggest that the incidence of poverty declined sharply between the study period, but is more favored in relatively well-off Village Development Committee (VDC), Patan. Similarly, excessively high proportion of Occupational Caste (OC) households are chronically poor, none of them were non-poor in both surveys. Moreover, the risk of them falling into chronic poverty is significantly higher. Also, female-headed household, and household with higher dependency ratio has significantly higher risk of falling into chronic poverty. However, landholding and irrigation coverage reduce the risk of households to fall into chronic poverty. Further, disaggregation of transitory poverty into move-into and move-out of poverty also shows higher risk of OC households to move-into poverty, mainly due to their limited socio-economic assets. In addition, the occurrence of natural disasters also increases the risk of households to move-into poverty. On the other hand, Increase in schooling years of household’s head and landholding help the household to move-out of poverty. Therefore, any poverty reduction program to deal with transitory as well as chronic poverty should focus relatively remote VDCs like Melauli. Similarly, OC households, whose major occupation is either agriculture or laboring, should be targeted. Poverty reduction programs should generate employment opportunities, which help to deal with both chronic as well as transitory poverty through a reduction in the dependency ratio. Similarly, introduction of temporary relief programs during occurrence of natural disasters will be very effective in dealing with transient poverty.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture has contributed greatly to food security in Asia - and irrigation projects present new opportunities for reducing poverty. This requires that projects deliberately tilt towards the poor. Moreover, policymakers, implementers and managers need to adopt an integrated approach when using irrigation as a pro-poor intervention strategy. With the right institutional and technical conditions, an effective incentives structure and proper implementation and management practices, pro-poor irrigation projects can make a significant difference to poverty in the region.

N2  - Driven largely by financial pressures, many governments are transferring full or partial management responsibility for irrigation systems from government agencies to farmers organized into Water User Associations (WUAs). In most cases, improving the situation of poor farmers has been a secondary aim of this reform. But there is increasing evidence that Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) can actually negatively impact the situation of poor farmers—and, in extreme cases, can even cause the collapse of irrigation schemes. New research assessed two different IMT programs: The Gujarat Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) program, one of the first IMT programs in India, and the Andhra Pradesh Farmers’ Management of Irrigation Systems (APFMIS) program, which with its sweeping reforms has served as an example worldwide. This research suggests that even if the IMT process contains all the right ingredients on paper—such as strong voting rights for farmers, irrespective of farm size—poor farmers are less informed on the whole about their rights and so tend to lose out on many of the potential benefits of IMT. The study showed that in both Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh poor farmers tended to participate more in the repair and rehabilitation work, while the larger farmers were more involved in the decision-making process—dominating the meetings and committees (see fig.1). To make IMT more pro-poor, and to ensure the viability of WUAs, which depend heavily on the labor contribution of small farmers, policy makers should take steps to ensure that poor farmers participate equally in decision-making processes. These steps include raising awareness and access to information, and making the election of WUA committees (which favor the village elite) more competitive and transparent. Monitoring participation in WUA activities and decision making against a reliable, and easily available indicator of poverty—farm size—is a key in evaluating equity trends over time.

N2  - The MamasınDam, that was built between 1952-1967 in the 12 km East of Aksaray Province on the Uluırmak River with an area of 16 km square. The Mamasın Dam is being used for irrigation of 25 thousand hectare in agriculture and sanitation of Aksaray Province. Any dam project in Turkey, as well as the Mamasın, has direct and indirect social impacts and assessments. The main indirect social impact of the Mamasın Dam project is the rise of fishing sector in Aksaray, includes four villages in the coast of the dam’s lake. There is a fishing cooperative with more than 30 members holding the fishing in the dam, which feeds the people of Aksaray Province and the hotels in Cappadocia region. The cooperative and the fishing gave alternative income and social security opportunities in the area. To understand and analyze the social impacts of the fishing sector, which was not planned in the project of the Dam and later accidently it had rosen, interviews were conducted in the two villages of the fishing sector (Gökçe and Çatalsuvillages). The members of the cooperative and other fishermen were interviewed. Other interviews were conducted with the restaurant owners of the tourism destination and officials of the Aksaray Province Food, Agriculture and Husbandry Directory. As the result the rise of fishing sector in Aksaray Province as an indirect social impact of the Mamasın Dam was evaluated around the arguments of rural development.

N2  - The model of Brazilian land reform is based on settlements of families without
land, in unoccupied public lands, or by expropriation of unproductive estates. The market
assisted land reform programs are considered complementary instruments of land reform.
They are used to provide credit for land purchase by groups of landless farmers directly from
the land market. The aim of this paper was to measure the profit efficiency, considering two
different mechanisms of land access. In this paper, analysis of profit efficiency was performed
using the stochastic frontier analysis. The frontier of production was estimated based on
Cobb-Douglas production function. The data set represents the states: Bahia, Ceará,
Maranhão, Pernambuco and the north region of Minas Gerais. The overall efficiency
estimates were 0.3163. The efficiency estimates were 0.3678 for the farmers assigned by
expropriation, and 0.3537 for the farmers with market land access. The production showed
decreasing gains with the major partial elasticity for land. The positive efficiency effect
sources are: off-farm labor, collective labor, location in superior soil class county areas,
location in Maranhão and Ceará states, age of head of household, crops with irrigation or
flood, and use of machinery. The negative efficiency effect sources are: outer incomes and
family consumption of its own production.

N2  - This study explores the constraints on agricultural productivity and priorities in boosting productivity in rice, the main staple in Madagascar, using a range of different data sets and analytical methods, integrating qualitative assessments by farmers and quantitative evidence from panel data production function analysis and willingness-to-pay estimates for chemical fertilizer. Nationwide, farmers seek primarily labor productivity enhancing interventions, e.g., improved access to agricultural equipment, cattle and irrigation. Shock mitigation measures, land productivity increasing technologies and improved land tenure are reported to be much less important. Poorer farmers have significantly lower rice yields than richer farmers, as well as significantly less land. Estimated productivity gains are greatest for the poorest with respect to adoption of climatic shock mitigation measures and chemical fertilizer. However, fertilizer use on rice appears only marginally profitable and highly variable across years. Research and interventions aimed at reducing costs and price volatility within the fertilizer supply chain might help at least the more accessible regions to more readily adopt chemical fertilizer.

N2  - The aim of the study was to assess the profitability of red sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) production in relation to incurred labor and capital inputs in selected horticultural farms. The analyzed group consisted of farms producing sweet pepper in traditional cultivation in the districts of Przysucha and Radom. To determine the correlation between income and expenditure, in the analyzed farms a multiple Cobb-Douglas production function was ued. Data were generated using a cost accounting method for estimating the feasibility of production and it was analyzed by using project evaluation methods, like the Pay Back Period (PBP), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR), Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The results of the estimation of Cobb-Douglas production function parameters show that the dominant positive impact on the gross return value was the cost of seedlings, irrigation costs and overhead costs. The conducted analyzes showed that the NPV for the investment is PLN 240,148, with a B/C ratio of 1.78. On the other hand, the PBP, in this case, amounts to 1.45 crop season and the IRR reached a level of 22% annually.The sensitivity analysis carried out showed that the most important factors affecting the profitability of pepper production in field cultivation are product prices, seed costs, fertilizer costs and human labor costs.

N2  - This study investigatesthe impact of climatic factors on sugarcane yield in 19 Indian states. Cobb-Douglas production function model was used to estimate the regression coefficients of explanatory variables with sugarcane yield using state-wise panel data during 1970-2017. There upon, it estimates the marginal change in sugarcane yield as 1 unit increase in climatic factors using marginal impact analysis technique. It was also projected sugarcane yield across Indian states for different years (i.e. 2040s, 2060s, 2080s and 2100s). Empirical results shows that area sown and value of production per hectare land have a positive implication on sugarcane yield. Climatic factors such as annual average maximum temperature, annual actual rainfall and precipitation show a negative impact on sugarcane yield. Sugarcane yield, therefore, decreases as increase in annual average maximum temperature, and annual actual rainfall and precipitation. Results based on marginal impact analysis technique imply that sugarcane yield is expected to be declined by 1.51% due to one-unit change in climatic factors in India. Estimates demonstrate that marginal impact of climatic factors on sugarcane yield was significantly varied across Indian states due to extreme diversity in climatic factors, geographical location, irrigation facilities, natural resources, farm management practices, use of advance technologies and fertilizer in sugarcane farming, agricultural development policies and agricultural R&amp;D. Results imply that sugarcane yield is likely to be declined by 3.84%, 4.69%, 5.55% and 6.62% in different climate change scenarios in India. Thus, it would create extensive problems for sugarcane farmers, agricultural labours, sugar industries, consumers and government in India

N2  - The objective of this study is to provide monetary estimates of the impacts of climate change in
European agricultural sector. The future scenarios incorporate socio-economic projections
derived from several socio-economic scenarios and experiments conducted using global climate
models and regional climate models. The quantitative results are based simulations using the
GTAP general equilibrium models system that includes all relevant economic activities. The
estimated changes in the exports and imports of agricultural goods, value of GDP and value of
world supply under the climate and socio-economic scenarios show significant regional
differences between northern and southern European countries. The simulations were based on
crop productivity changes that considered no restrictions in water availability for irrigation or
restrictions in the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Therefore the results should be considered
optimistic from the production point and pessimistic from the environmental point of view.
Water restrictions and socio-economic variables that modify the probabilities of change
occurring may also be considered in a later stage of the study. The monetary estimates show that
in all cases uncertainty derived from socio-economic scenarios has a larger effect than the
derive from climate scenarios.

N2  - India’s decelerating wheat- and rice-yield growth rates have led to questions of whether India’s agricultural sector will be able to meet future food demands. To explore this issue, ERS researchers measure sector-level agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) growth and evaluate how public policies affected TFP from 1980 to 2008. During this period, substantial regional differences in TFP growth emerged: the Indian West and South achieved faster TFP growth than the rest of the country, largely due to rapid growth in horticulture and animal products. Of the policies hypothesized to stimulate TFP, India’s public agricultural research and higher education programs had the greatest effect on TFP growth, followed by public investments in irrigation infrastructure. These effects propelled TFP in Northern and Western India more than in the rest of the country. Groundwater irrigation from wells accelerated TFP more than surface-water irrigation from canals. Other drivers of TFP growth included research investments of international institutions and an emerging private sector. Public investment in rural education has had mixed effects, depending on education levels. These findings support an optimistic view that Indian agriculture will be able to meet the broadening spectrum of future food demands. Critical to that optimism, though, is continued innovation from public and private research systems, especially in seed development, and from irrigation and high-value-commodity production technologies.

N2  - Agriculture is a provider of food and, to a certain extent, public goods such as biodiversity and landscape, but it can also have negative impacts on natural assets such as biodiversity and water quality. In addition to implementing policies that target individual farmers, different approaches are needed to promote collective action. The literature review and three New Zealand case studies (Sustainable Farming Fund, East Coast Forestry Project and North Otago Irrigation Company) have identified some findings including benefits and barriers of collective action and key factors for its success. Collective action should be given serious consideration in addressing agri-environmental problems.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to review trends in government expenditures in the developing world, to analyze the causes of change, and to develop an analytical framework for determining the differential impacts of various government expenditures on economic growth. 

Contrary to common belief, it is found that structural adjustment programs increased the size of government spending, but not all sectors received equal treatment. As a share of total government spending, expenditures on agriculture, education, and infrastructure in Africa; on agricultural and health in Asia; and on education and infrastructure in Latin America, all declined as a result of the structural adjustment programs. 

The impact of various types of government spending on economic growth is mixed. In Africa, government spending on agriculture and health was particularly strong in promoting economic growth. Asia's investments in agriculture, education, and defense had positive growth-promoting effects. However, all types of government spending except health were statistically insignificant in Latin America. Structural adjustment programs promoted growth in Asia and Latin America, but not in Africa. 

Growth in agricultural production is most crucial for poverty alleviation in rural areas. Agricultural spending, irrigation, education, and roads all contributed strongly to this growth. Disaggregating total agricultural expenditures into research and non-research spending reveals that research had a much larger impact on productivity than non-research spending.

N2  - Agriculture production in the Texas High Plains is highly dependent on climate especially with the decline in water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. There is increasing pressure on the Ogallala Aquifer as a result of an increase in population and expansion of agricultural production. The decline in water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer along with precipitation variability are affecting agricultural production, thus increasing the risk faced by farmers.
The primary goal of the study is to determine the effect of rainfall variability on yield and income from crops grown in the Texas High Pains. The specific objectives are to estimate the effect of precipitation variability on dryland and irrigated crops; to conduct risk analysis for dryland and irrigated crops and estimate revenue loss/gain due to variability in precipitation; and, to perform sensitivity analysis to analyze the effect of precipitation changes on profitability for a farm enterprise. 
The information about the dryland county-level yield data was collected from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for the period of 1972 to 2012 for dryland cotton and dryland sorghum while dryland wheat data was for the period of 1973 to 2012. The county-level climatic information was collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The information about irrigated corn was collected from AgriPartners Program from 1998 to 2007. The relationship between growing season precipitation variability and dryland yield was examined for dryland sorghum, dryland wheat, and dryland cotton using ordinary least square regression. The effect of precipitation fluctuation on irrigated corn profitability, and irrigation water demand was also estimated. The coefficients of variation for price, yield, precipitation, and revenue were considered for different sub periods.
The average season county precipitation levels are 13.65 inches, 13.16 inches, and 15.01 inches for dryland sorghum (Deaf Smith County), dryland wheat (Hansford County), and dryland cotton (Lynn County) respectively. The R2 values from the restricted models are 90%, 93% and 87% for dryland sorghum, dryland wheat, and dryland cotton respectively. The R2 value of the restricted irrigated corn model was 96%. The higher the coefficient of variation for precipitation, the greater the risk faced by farmers. A decline in the coefficient of variation for precipitation by 9.59% favored dryland sorghum yield increase by 5.14 cwt/ac from 1972-1981 to 1982-1991. 
In Deaf Smith County, 570,813 ac-ft. of irrigation water will be needed for irrigated sorghum if there is a 25% decrease in the average seasonal precipitation received for the next 50 years. At a natural gas price of $4.5/Mcf and corn sales price of $7/bu, variation in the Hansford County seasonal precipitation by ±2.69 inches will change the optimal profit by ±$27.26/ac. More irrigation water will be needed in the future if any less amount of precipitation is received.

N2  - This paper demonstrates a method for reconstructing flexible form production functions using minimal disaggregated data sets. The policy focus of our approach puts emphasis on the ability of the model to reproduce the existing production system and predict the disaggregate outcomes of policy changes. We combine Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) with Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) estimation to capture the individual heterogeneity of the local production environment, and allow the reconstructed production function to precisely replicate the input usage and outputs produced in the base year. Since we can generate demand, supply and substitution elasticities from the reconstructed model we can represent a wide range of policy responses. 
The empirical application used in this paper is a production model of California's irrigated crop sector that was constructed to measure the economic effect of environmental policy changes to irrigation water supplies, as part of a joint State and Federal program termed CalFed. We demonstrate that the disaggregate regional models give greater predictive precision, when compared with the model reconstructed on the aggregate data, and that they show a significant variation in the calculated regional elasticities of input demand and output response. From this, we conclude that any gains from aggregation - namely the reduction of small sample bias of the parameter estimates - would be swamped by the distortion of production response to policy changes, given the heterogeneity of the regions and the resultant bias.

N2  - China has started to implement the most stringent of Three Red Lines water policy since 2012, which sets targets for total water use, water use efficiency, and water quality for a number of benchmark years to 2030 by province and prefecture. This paper aims to develop an integrated regional CGE and water resource model at river basin-provincial level for China and to quantify regional and sectoral economic impacts of three red lines. Five policy scenarios are constructed to assess the impacts of water red lines, including the red line of total water use cap, irrigation efficiency, industrial water use intensity, surface water pollution and all redlines combined. The red line of total water use cap will increase water shortage drastically, leading to considerable negative impacts on the economic growth of East, South Central and Southwest. The sectors with the higher water use intensity such as machinery and equipment, metal and metal products, chemical products and non-metal products are affected most. Other two red lines need to go hand in hand to minimize water shortage and mitigate potentially negative economic impacts. Establishing regional water use right market and promoting economic restructuring are two policy options to cope with water scarcity challenge.

N2  - In the Northeastern region of Brazil, production alternatives that are
economically feasible are scarce and the organic acerola production can be set among those which increases income and keep the families in the rural areas. Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility
of the organic acerola production under deterministic and risk conditions in the Irrigation District of Tabuleiro
Litorâneo of Piauí State, Brazil. To this end, we used primary data gathered from a sample of 23 producers in 2011.
As methods of analysis, we applied measurements of economic outcomes for the deterministic assessments and the
Monte Carlo simulation method for risk analysis. The deterministic evaluation showed that ten producers from the
sample were economically infeasible while the other had acceptable profitability. For risk analysis, we obtained similar
results, noting that producers who had developed the activity without following technical recommendations were
impractical and faced higher risk, whereas those who are more technified have higher profitability and lower risk. We
suggest carrying out public policies such as the provision of training programs in organic acerola production and
agricultural management and marketing, in addition to individualized technical assistance to support producers in
the right use of inputs.

By using cluster analysis method, we divide Inner Mongolia into 5 different types of project zone, namely multiple-purpose project zone of the western Greater Khingan Mountains, irrigation project zone of Nenjiang and the western Liao River plain, the central dry farming complementary irrigation project zone, Hetao Plain and Huanghe River irrigation project zone, and the western oasis irrigation project zone. This paper analyzes the natural conditions of all regions and constraint factors of agricultural production, and establishes the corresponding project design model, in order to provide reference for the land consolidation project design in Inner Mongolia and even other similar regions.

N2  - Tunisia is among the Mediterranean countries that are threatened by climate change. The agricultural sector is the economic sector that will be most affected by this phenomenon. Thinking of adequate adaptation policies to increase the resilience of certain agricultural production systems is a fundamental condition for ensuring the sustainability of agricultural activity, especially irrigated agriculture. To assess the degree of resilience of irrigated agricultural production systems in the centraleastern region of Tunisia, case of Kalâa Kebira, a bio-economic model was applied to analyze the impact of two scenarios. The first represents only the variation of climate change while in the second one, we add an integrated policy based on the pricing of irrigation water and the subsidy of the purchase cost of seasonal potato seeds. The results of the simulation confirmed the negative economic and environmental impacts of climate change on small scale intensive farms and also large farms in general. The intervention of the public government through an integrated policy is likely to improve the degree of resilience of farms through a compromise between the economic objective (the agricultural income) and the environmental objective (soil salinity) for semi-intensive farms in the study area.

N2  - This case study builds on an ongoing large-scale quantitative research project undertaken by BIDS/IRRI since 1987 originally in 64 unions from 57 districts of the country. It adds a qualitative research component to examine the impact of modern rice varieties (MVs) on livelihoods in a structured sample of eight of these villages across a range of favorable and unfavorable contexts. This component was structured using the sustainable livelihoods framework and employed focus groups stratified by poverty ranking and gender. 

Rice is grown over almost 75 percent of the land area and is the country's most important crop. Two-thirds of this land area is now covered by MV technology after a rapid expansion over the past 15 years. The adoption process has been driven by the subsistence demands of households rather than by systematic agricultural extension efforts. Smaller farmers have adopted MVs more readily than larger ones. The privatization of shallow tubewell (STW) irrigation helped to make widescale MV adoption possible, as has the provision of improved infrastructure such as rural roads, bridges, and rural electrification. As a result, the general issue of MV adoption is no longer a current one for most farmers, except for households in flood-prone and coastal areas where adoption has so far proved difficult.

The quantitative research shows that for households with access to land there have been direct adoption impacts in the form of increased yields and higher profits. However, since rice now only represents around 20 percent of most households' overall income, nonagricultural income is found to have gained dramatically in importance for rural households. While the profitability has declined over time, rice contributes to improved food security and provides a "springboard" for both rich and poor farm households moving into nonfarm income generation and employment. 

In terms of impact on the poor, MV adoption has no significant direct impact except for a small fraction who have been able to access land from the expanding tenancy market. But indirect impacts in the form of employment and price changes are found to have been largely positive for the poor in reducing vulnerability. The qualitative research component generally confirmed these general findings, highlighting other factors such as the improved status associated with fixed-rent tenancy and "contract" labor arrangements. 

The qualitative research also shows negative adoption impacts such as shrinking common property resources (wild fish, vegetables, etc., and declining soil fertility, both of which may increase the long-term vulnerability of the poor. It also throws light on the processes of technology dissemination. After initial release and dissemination of MVs by BRRI and the Department of Agricultural Extension, adoption has taken place primarily though informal farmer-to-farmer learning. The focus group discussions revealed low levels of confidence in the largely inactive public sector agricultural extension service and highlighted the highly variable performance of both local and national NGOs engaged in providing credit. It was found that the linking of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies was useful in (a) generating complementary data of different kinds on similar issues and (b) generating new data missed within a purely quantitative approach. 

The sustainable livelihoods framework was a useful, flexible tool for structuring the qualitative data collection and analysis. However, the research study as a whole was limited by the fact that the qualitative component was "bolted onto" a quantitative study already underway. Therefore the framework, and the various data collection methodologies, were not systematically integrated across both components of the study. In conclusion, future agricultural research on rice may need to further address the question of MV adoption potential on risk-prone lands, the relevance of existing technology dissemination systems, the relationship between MV adoption and crop diversification, and the challenges of more sustainable crop management techniques.

N2  - Farmers face many risks which arise from natural, economic and socio-political environments. Risk sharing institutions like national insurance and credit schemes that help reduce the burden of risk to society are weak in Uasin Gishu county. Private sector insurance products are still in their developing stages and this has prompted farmers to turn to self insurance strategies that include diversification and social mechanisms for coping with risk. Off-farm investment is one of the diversification strategies whose prevalence and effectiveness in risk management have not been evaluated. This study sought to determine risk attitudes of farmers, to identify the determinants of off-farm investments and to investigate the effectiveness of off-farm investments in risk management. Data was collected from 100 randomly selected farm households. The ELCE method was used and exponential utility functions fitted by the method of nonlinear least squares and used to estimate the coefficients of absolute risk aversion. A logit model was used to identify determinants of off-farm investments. Effectiveness of off-farm investments in risk management was assessed by simulating the effect of replacing the weight of off-farm income with that of farm income on the coefficient of variation of total income. Results indicated that the major risks of concern to farmers were drought, market/price, pests and diseases and institutional risks with prevalence rates of 59, 34, 4 and 3% respectively. All the farmers in the study were risk averse. Years of experience in farming, employment income, gender and farm income significantly determined off-farm investment decisions. Simulation results showed that off-farm investment income reduces risk. Government policies and institutional mechanisms that reduce risk (such as crop insurance and irrigation technologies) and those that facilitate farmers‟ access to assets like off-farm investments in order to manage risks in farming are required.

N2  - Watershed programme is an important intervention in dryland areas to improve livestock productivity
through increased feed and fodder supply. The present study has focused on the impact of watershed
interventions on crop-livestock linkages with particular emphasis on how the interventions have affected
the quantity of stovers/straws as livestock feeding materials in bridging the demand-supply gap. The
study has been carried out in three typical Shivalik foothill watersheds (two treated and one untreated) in
the Panchkula district of Haryana state. The impact of watershed development programme has been
estimated by adopting both with and without approach and before and after approach. The untreated
watershed has derived 65 per cent of its total income from animal husbandry. On the contrary, this sector
has contributed 42 per cent and 20 per cent in two treated watersheds. The availability of supplemental
irrigation enabled the villagers to step up cropping intensity. The number of goats has reduced considerably
in both treated watersheds and the number of stall-fed buffaloes has increased. Adult cattle units per
household and per hectatre of cultivated area have been found to be highest in the untreated watershed.
Green and dry fodder availability, both from cultivated lands and forest area, has increased as a result of
implementation of watershed programme. Although the gap between requirement and availability has
narrowed down in both the treated watersheds, significant gains could be realized in Sambhalwa watershed
due to sufficient water availability to all the households. Bunga watershed has also shown effectiveness
of watershed development programme in reducing demand –supply gap of fodder. This gap, however,
widened after reaching the saturation point of watershed programme, i.e. after 22 years of its implementation.

N2  - Kenya’s economy is relatively diverse, with both agricultural and industrial potential. However, the
economy has performed poorly over the last decade, and poverty and inequality have risen. This paper
examines the impact of alternative growth paths and rural investments on poverty using an economy-wide
model. It finds that if Kenya continues along its current growth path, its economy will have to grow by
more than 10 percent per year over the coming decade to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
of halving poverty by 2015. Therefore, Kenya must search for alternative sources of poverty-reducing
growth. The results of the model indicate that poverty is unlikely to decline significantly without an
acceleration of agricultural growth. Growth in agriculture is found to benefit both urban and rural
households, whereas industry-led growth benefits a smaller segment of the urban population, thus
exacerbating inequality. Kenya’s current Economic Recovery Strategy, however, is not optimistic about
agriculture’s growth potential, focusing more heavily on industry-led growth. Therefore, as Kenya
prepares its new national strategy, the country should place greater emphasis on and direct resources
toward accelerating agricultural growth.
In assessing the impact of rural investments on growth and poverty, the paper finds that
increasing agricultural spending to meet the 10 percent target set by the Maputo Declaration would lift an
additional 1.5 million people above the poverty line by 2015. Specific agricultural investments have
higher returns in different parts of the country, however. Irrigation favors the lowlands and the poorest
segment of the population, while research and extension (R&amp;E) favors the midlands and highlands.
Investment in R&amp;E is also found to have the highest returns in both growth and poverty reduction.
However, increasing agricultural spending to 10 percent of total spending is insufficient to meet either the
MDG or the 6 percent agricultural growth target of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development
Program, which Kenya has recently adopted. . Achieving this target requires nonagricultural investments,
such as in roads and market development. Building rural roads and reducing agricultural transaction costs
significantly reduces poverty and encourages growth beyond rural areas. While it is necessary to increase
spending on agriculture, the fiscal burden of an agricultural strategy can be greatly reduced by improving
investment efficiency.

The results show that the social benefit arising from the construction of road projects is good, while the social benefit arising from the construction of irrigation facilities is poor; the matching effect of supply and demand of public investment is poor, especially for the investment in irrigation facilities; on the whole, villagers' satisfaction with public investment has been promoted, but most of the villagers are still unsatisfied with the current irrigation facilities. The major capital source of rural public investment is from the government, but from the perspective of the villagers' demand, we should further increase the public financial input.

N2  - En octubre de 2000 entro en vigor la Directiva Marco de Aguas (DMA) que prescribe la utilizacion de principios y herramientas economicas para alcanzar sus objetivos ecologicos. Concretamente, el articulo 5 de la Directive promueve la realizacion de un analisis economico de los usos del agua para cada Demarcacion, que incluye el pronostico de los indicadores y directrices economico del sector agrario de la Cuenca del Guadalquivir realizado en este contexto. La agricultura es el principal consumidro de agua, con una tendencia al alza y en creciente competencia con el reso de los usos, para los que se esperan importantes crecimientos futuros. Estos resultados muestran la fotografia que debera tenerse en cuenta en el diseno de las politicas hidricas presentes y futuras en general, y en particular en la elaboracion de los Programas de Medidads prescritos para el ano 2009 por la Directiva...European Directive 2000/60/CE establishes the communitarian framework on water policy and it requires all inland and coastal waters to reach good ecological status by 2015. Water Framework Directive's (WFD) article five required river basin characterization by 2005 in terms of economic analysis of water use, as a previous step for river basins management plans to achieve the Directive objectives. This paper illustrates the methodology and results of agricultural water use for the Guadalquivir River Basin (Southern Spain), which extends over a surface of nearly sixty four thousand square kilometers (double of Belgium size), with a populations over five million people. It is a typical Mediterranean climate region with periodic drought phenomena and where irrigation consumes 85 percent of water resources. This economic analysis of current water uses offers a view on the importance of economic activity on pressure and impacts over resources at the present moment (baseline scenario 2001), clarifying the relation between technical and economics information. It also provides with the tendencies scenario (2015) based on the foreseen evolution of key drivers of agricultural water use. This analysis should allow stakeholders to identify the gap between predicted situation and the Directive objectives in order to elaborate River Basin Management Plans. It should also help to evaluate existing information suitability to Directive objectives and determine the need of new data. Following the DPSIR (driving forces-pressure-state-impact-response) scheme, this research identifies the main key factors for estimating the pressure on the resource, assessing the quantitative (water consumption) and qualitative (pollution) pressure for the resource and prognosticates the evolution of these key elements in the future, in which CAP reform is taken into account. Results indicate a contained future increase of agricultural water consumption (2 percent) and an increased competence with other water uses (urban and tourist), which should be considered for the future elaboration of the Program of Measures in the River Basin.

N2  - Small reservoirs are a critical coping mechanism in water-stressed rural areas in Africa, providing immense livelihood benefits that include improved food and water security, entrepreneurial activities and climate resilience. Challenges associated with the implementation of investments in small reservoirs include appropriate site selection, weak institutions, insufficient maintenance and sedimentation. The findings from this study suggest that the benefits of small reservoirs may be tapped more efficiently by rehabilitating old sites rather than building new infrastructure. However, the findings also point to broader lessons on the need to change the way of doing business, i.e., to adopt a long-term, more holistic approach (or model) to the construction and maintenance of small reservoirs that matches the degree of the challenge associated with sustainably tapping the benefits of the water that they store.

Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI).
N2  - Water scarcity became a common phenomenon in Ethiopia with drought frequency of at least once in three years while the country owns a large irrigation potential that should be exploited sustainably. Various national and international institutions are currently engaged in developing small scale irrigation (SSI) schemes for poverty alleviation. A monitoring and evaluation exercise was conducted in 2004 and in 2006 in four administrative regions of Ethiopia, namely Tigray, Southern regions, Oromia and Amhara, to assess the benefits and associated environmental effects of SSI investments of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). A combination of participatory M&amp;E tools namely, individual interviews, group discussions, key informants, review of relevant documents and field observations were used. The mission was supported by an in depth pre-mission socio-economic survey in three representative irrigation schemes. Data from the sites indicated that 50 % of the respondents had improved food security and higher income, while 26% of the respondents did not see any change on their livelihoods. Crop yield under irrigation was by 35% to 200% higher than under rain fed conditions, with much higher benefit obtained from high potential areas and in farms where external inputs (fertilizer, improved seeds and pesticides) are accessible. The positive effect was more visible with horticultural crops. There has been also a shift towards improved varieties with access to irrigation. Farmers replaced early maturing but low yielding varieties with high yielding varieties. Crop diversification increased significantly, in some sites from three to about 15 species, although this decision making process did not favour legumes. The apparent effect was on crop rotation, intercropping and land management with in the order of 79, 42 and 35%, respectively. On the other hand, there is a decline in number of livestock per household, but an increased number of draught oxen. The decline is associated with reduced grazing area due to conversion of dry season fallow to vegetable fields and an increase in area enclosure in the sloppy landscapes. The shift from cereal to vegetable-dominated cropping increased the competition for water between downstream and upstream users and between resource rich and poor farmers. The impact of irrigation schemes should be evaluated better on long term benefits than short term fixes, as farmers initiated long term investments like planting perennial fruits, bought calves and other retail trade investments. The communities would benefit most from further integration of livestock into the schemes by adopting feed sourcing strategies for dairy and fattening. The paper also presented best-bets for improved irrigation management in Ethiopia.

N2  - The provision of social goods is one form of government intervention because the allocations of scarce resources through the market system have flaws.(Stiglitz,2000) Furthermore, there are types of goods and services that the private sector would not undertake due to massive capitalization and lesser profitability compared to other alternative projects. For instance, a profit maximizing private firm will not produce a good or provide a service without a corresponding assurance that these are paid and they are able to recover their investment. Eastern Visayas is relatively an agricultural region. As a rice-producing area in the country, the region has been a recipient of government budget for irrigation facilities. This is in pursuance of Republic Act 6978 otherwise known as an “Act to Promote Rural Development by providing for an Accelerated Program within a Ten Year Period for the Construction of Irrigation Projects.” Irrigation facilities are government projects intended for the farmers and built with the objective of increasing rice production. The reality of time dictates that the government must be prudent in allocating and distributing the limited financial resources for social goods and services. Given the enormous government spending on the various irrigation facilities in Leyte, an evaluation on how the government is able to recoup its expenditure through the amortization and service payment made by the farmers is imperative. In this manner, people would know whether or not government funds are being used efficiently and effectively and if the intended objectives of promoting rural development are realized. Using benefit cost analysis; this paper evaluated 10 irrigation facilities in Eastern Visayas. Secondary data from the National Irrigation Administration were used in the analysis and findings showed that the government is not able to recover its direct cost incurred in these irrigation facilities.

N2  - The socioeconomic costs of floods, droughts, and water scarcity in the years 2030 and 2095 are examined under three climate scenarios: continuation of the current climate and two climate-change scenarios based on projections from the respective results of the Canadian and Hadley general circulation models. Measures of the adequacy of water supplies to meet both withdrawal and instream uses under current and future conditions are developed for the 18 major water resources regions and 99 assessment subregions in the conterminous United States. Past and likely future changes in the infrastructure available to control and distribute water, the costs of nontraditional sources of supply, water management practices, conservation opportunities, the nature of the economy, slack in the water supply system, and institutions influencing water use are examined and provide the basis for evaluating the impacts of changes in both climate and non-climate factors on U.S. water resources. The impacts of the climate changes are calculated as the changes in the costs of maintaining the projected no-climate change, non-irrigation offstream water uses with the climate-altered supplies. The costs and benefits are estimated under three alternative management strategies that differ in the protection provided for stream-flows and irrigation. The results support several general conclusions. First, a greenhouse warming could have major impacts on the future costs of floods, droughts, and balancing water demands and supplies. Second, the contrasting hydrologic implications of the Canadian and Hadley climate models indicate that the magnitude as well as the direction of these impacts are uncertain and likely to vary significantly among water resources regions. Third, there are many opportunities to adapt to changing hydrological conditions, and the net costs are particularly sensitive to the institutions that determine how the resource is managed and allocated among users. This report was prepared as part of the Water Assessment Sector Team's contribution to the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change for the Nation being conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The climate-change scenarios used in this report were developed for use in the National Assessment.

N1  - Presented at the 22nd Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Warsaw, Poland
N2  - This study provides statistical emulators of global by gridded crop models included in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project Fast Track project to estimate irrigated crop yields and associated irrigation water withdrawals simulated at the grid cell level. An ensemble of crop model simulations is used to build a panel of monthly summer weather variables and corresponding annual yields and irrigation water withdrawals from five gridded crop models. This dataset is then used to estimate crop-specific response functions for each crop model. The average normalized root mean square errors for the response functions range from 3% to 6% for irrigated yields and 2% to 8% for irrigated water withdrawal. Further in- and out-of-sample validation exercises confirm that the statistical emulators are able to replicate the crop models’ spatial patterns of irrigated crop yields and irrigation water withdrawals reasonably well, both in levels and in terms of changes overtime, although accuracy varies by model and by region. The emulators estimated in this study therefore provides a reliable and computationally efficient alternative to global gridded crop yield models.

N2  - The staff working paper "Stranded Irrigation Assets" (Roper, H., Sayers, C. and Smith, A) was released on 28 June 2006. Prior to the National Water Initiative (NWI), irrigation authorities imposed restrictions on outward trade of water entitlements partly to protect remaining irrigators against the risks and consequences of having to recover the costs of "stranded" or under-utilised assets. This could be one of a number of reasons behind low levels of permanent water trade. 

This paper examines ways of minimising the financial impact of stranded assets on remaining irrigators with the relaxation of trading restrictions. The aim of the project was to research the options to address the perceived adverse financial consequences of stranded irrigation assets. The authors concluded that it is not certain that proposals under the NWI to relax restrictions on permanent water trading will necessarily result in widespread stranded irrigation assets. Furthermore, stranded assets do not represent an impediment to the efficient use of infrastructure, the allocation of entitlements, or the use of water. 

The key findings are that instead of using the ongoing payment of access fees, "retail tagging" and "exit" fees to manage financial impacts, a more efficient approach would involve abandoning charges for renewals annuities predicated on the full replacement of existing assets; revaluing under-utilised assets "appropriately" to reflect their current economic value in use; charging to recover costs fully; and the introduction of cost differentiated charges for individual irrigators within irrigation areas. The project is part of a larger suite of Commission research on water policy, which includes modelling regional economic impacts of changes in water trade and research into irrigation externalities. It also complements the commissioned research study on rural water use and the environment.

The views expressed in this paper are those of the staff involved and do not necessarily reflect those of the Productivity Commission.

N2  - This paper estimates a structural econometric model of household decisions regarding income strategies, participation in programs and organizations, crop choices, land management, and labor use, and their implications for agricultural production and land degradation; based upon a survey of over 450 households and their farm plots in Uganda. The results generally support the Boserupian model of population-induced agricultural intensification, but do not support the "more people-less erosion" hypothesis, with population pressure found to contribute to erosion in the densely populated highlands. Agricultural technical assistance programs have location-specific impacts on agricultural production and land degradation, contributing to higher value of crop production in the lowlands, but to soil erosion in the highlands. By contrast, NGO programs focusing on agriculture and environment are helping to reduce erosion, but have mixed impacts on production. We find little evidence of impact of access to markets, roads and credit, land tenure or title on agricultural intensification and crop production, though road access appears to contribute to land degradation in the highlands. Education increases household incomes, but also reduces crop production in the lowlands. We do not find evidence of a poverty-land degradation trap, while poverty has mixed impacts on agricultural production: smaller farms obtain higher crop production per hectare, while households with fewer livestock have crop production. These findings suggest that development of factor markets can improve agricultural efficiency. Several other factors that contribute to increased value of crop production, without significant impacts on land degradation, include specialized crop production, livestock and nonfarm income strategies, and irrigation. In general, the results imply that the strategies to increase agricultural production and reduce land degradation must be location-specific, and that there are few "win-win" opportunities to simultaneously increase production and reduce land degradation.

N2  - Study on Integrated Farming Systems Model Development was conducted by the Livelihood Improvement of Farming Community in Haor area through System approach Project of the Department of Agronomy, Bangladesh Agricultral University, Mymensigh worked in Purbo Tethulia village of Moahjganj upazilla, Netrakona district from April 2010 to June 2013 with the financial assistance from the National Agricultural Technology Project, SPGR subproject, Bangladesh Agricultural Council with the following objectives i. Increase productivity of field crops, vegetables, livestock and fishes in a household through the use of appropriate technogies and techniques devised/developed/ designed/refined by the farmers for ensuring household food security and nutritional upliftment and raising income ii. Diversify enterprises, mobilize resources and intensify farming and non farming activities for in situ employment generation iii. Conserve farm environment through efficient mobilization and management of natural resource for sustainable production sysyems iv. Develop human resoures for capacity building of the participants and improve their livelihood through system approach. Research programme was finalized in the Bench Mark Survey Workshop. Farmer selection for different research acivities was done as per plan for defferent five components. The crop and agroforestry component conducted experiments both in the homestead land and crop land. In the homestead area, year round vegetables were intervened through community trial for three years. Production of timber trees like mahogany, lambu and fruit trees like mango, guave, jujube, litchi, lemon papaya and jackfruit was also practiced. Timber trees are now at growing stage and among the fruit trees some like papaya, jujube and lemon are at bearing stage. African dhaincha was introduced around homestead fallow/waste land to protect homestead area from wave thrust and to produce biomass fuel. Field trials on rice, vegetables, spices and oil crops were conducted to intensify and diversify the cropping pattern and as well as to utilize the fallow/ waste land of the research site. Under livestock component, experiments were conducted on rearing of egg producing hen, duck, fattening of animals, milching cow, artificial insemination and chemical evaluation of available feedstuffs. A continuous vaccination programme against common diseases of poultry was maintained throughout the study period. Farmers’ response was very positive towards the experimental results. In the fisheries component, experiment on cage culture in open water, perennial and seasonal pond culture, dry fish and pickle were conducted/done. Among the experiments cage culture in open water proved to be a promising technology and fish pickle was highly appreciated in panel test. For the rural hydrology and mechanization component four studies were conducted. The physico-chemical properties of farm land and homestead soils were determined. Additional application of sulphur and zinc fertilizers were found not required. Both the surface and groundwater characteristics were studied. The maximum flood water depth was found around 3.0 m at farm land. Irrigation facilities developed by installing a shallow tubewell (STW) resulted higher crop production and motivated farmers to install four new STWs by their own capital. All the households (462) of Purbo Tethulia were intervened from the project. The interventions were crop, vegetable, livestock, poultry and fish farming. It was observed that as the number of enterprises increased in the farming systems, the income also increased. The evidence also showed that the training of the beneficiaries increased their knowledge and skill.

N2  - Soil, atmosphere, water and quality of agricultural product constitute the content of land ecological quality. Cixi City, through survey pilot project of basic farmland quality, carried out high precision soil geochemical survey and survey of agricultural products, irrigation water and air quality, and established ecological quality evaluation model of land. Based on the evaluation of soil geochemical quality, we conducted comprehensive quality assessment of atmosphere, water, agricultural products, and assessed the ecological quality of agricultural land in Cixi City. The evaluation results show that the ecological quality of most agricultural land in Cixi City is good, and there is ecological risk only in some local areas such as urban periphery. The experimental results provide demonstration and basis for the fine management of basic farmland and ecological protection.

N2  - Climate change and the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan both result in less water
for irrigation. Climate change is projected to take water from all uses including the
environment, whereas the likely sustainable diversion limit in the Plan aims
(amongst other things) to return water to the environment. We examine the impact
on flows and the returns to irrigation of potential reductions in irrigation allocations,
and the interaction with projected climate change impacts.
Our analysis is based on an integrated hydrology – economics model of the Murray-
Darling Basin, described in Kirby et al. (2012a). The model can quickly and easily run
new climate or other scenarios, accounting for flows at key environmental assets. It
uses a statistically calibrated economic model that can closely predict drought
outcomes accounting for allocation, climate and price circumstances.
We examined a 2,800 GL reduction to diversions, and compared it to a base case of
no reductions. We modelled the flows and irrigation returns for the no reduction and
reduction cases under the assumption of historical climate, a median climate change
and a more severe climate change. The climate change projections were those
examined in the CSIRO Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields project, slightly
extended for more recent years.
The broad results of this analysis are that:
• The reduction of water available to irrigation under the sustainable diversion
limit results in a less than proportional reduction in returns to irrigation. A 25
% reduction in water available on average over 114 years is estimated to
reduce the gross value of of irrigated agricultural production by about 3 % on
average. This is consistent with observation of reduced water availability in
the drought (Kirby et al., 2012b, Conner et al., 2012).
• Future droughts projected under climate change might be more severe that
those experienced to date, with an expectation of greater economic impact;
• A median climate change projection removes from the overall system slightly
more water than is gained for the environment under the sustainable
diversion limit. Under current sharing rules, this reduction in water comes
primarily from the environment. The exact impact on flows varies from valley
to valley. The impact of climate change is not considered in other analyses of
the Murray-Darling Basin plan.
3
• The returns to irrigation are not much affected by a median climate change,
with a 2 % reduction in gross value resulting from 3 % reduction in water
availability (on top of the reductions due to the diversion limit). This detail in
this result depends on the exact form of water sharing rules, and rules will
change in the future; we used a default assumption that the behaviour
resulting from the rules will be much as it is now.

N2  - Stochastic production frontiers of irrigated and rain-fed smallholder agriculture in
Tigray, Ethiopia, were fitted to a random sample of irrigated and rain-fed plots to
compare their technical efficiencies. Propensity Score Matching Method was applied
to select rain-fed plots with comparable bio-physical attributes to irrigated plots that might have blurred the true efficiency differences between the two systems. Irrigated farms are on a higher production frontier with significant inefficiencies, while rain-fed farms are on a lower production frontier with high efficiency levels. Thus, there is considerable potential for increasing outputs by improving the efficiency of irrigation
farms. Rain-fed systems need interventions in soil moisture management to move to a
higher production frontier. The study underlines the need for correcting the sequence and mix of yield boosting technologies such as irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizer that are promoted in arid environments such as Tigray. We recommend that water control must precede or implemented in tandem with improved seeds and
fertilizer technologies. Unless soil moisture is improved by investing in moisture
improving technologies, the use of seed and fertilizer in moisture stressed areas such
as Tigray may have adverse effects.

N2  - The long-term success of the Basin Plan and the Buy-Back will be judged by the capacity of the allocated public funding to deliver water to the environment, potable water supplies for the community and water for irrigation. Water property rights in
the Murray-Darling Basin can be divided into four distinct groups (ground water, high security, general security and supplementary) reflecting their inherent capacity to deliver water supplies in response to climatic conditions in a given year. The price paid for these entitlements reflects their ability to provide water under known climate variability. The optimal portfolio of water entitlements needs to encapsulate this information in order to determine which entitlements to purchase, the number
needed and their location in the river system in order to deliver net social benefits.


The optimal portfolio of entitlements is further complicated by the climate transitioning from a known mean and variance to a new mean and variance. The spatial impact of climate change on water resources is not uniform. Hence what is seen as a good portfolio now may in fact be sub-optimal in the future.


The aim of this paper is to illustrate the benefits of a state contingent framework for describing the optimal portfolio of water entitlements under a changing climate. By explicitly determining the real value of water entitlements in normal, drought and wet states of nature, we can determine the Buy-Back’s ability to achieve the Basin Plan’s goals and suggest an optimal entitlement mix to deliver long-term economic, social and environmental benefits under climate change.

N2  - The Columbia Basin Project (CBP) was one of the single largest projects undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation. The venture, which started in the 1930s in Central Washington, did not entirely turn out as expected. In fact, almost half of the proposed irrigable area, located mainly in the northeastern portion of the original plan, doesn't have any water supply from the project for irrigation purposes. The Odessa Sub-area is one of those areas. The land in this area is fertile and produces very high quality potatoes. Over the last couple of decades, potato production in this Odessa sub-region has been possible primarily because of irrigation based on deep wells. However, the underground water is drawing down and potato production may shut down as a result. Therefore, an economic threat on the economy of the Columbia Basin is in the offing, unless alternative water sources are negotiated. In this paper, we will mainly explore the regional economic impacts of the possible losses of potato production and its associated processing in the Odessa Sub-area. In section A, we briefly discuss the current status of the Columbia Basin Project. In section B, we discuss ground water level decline issues. In section C, we enumerate the economic impacts of the possible losses in potato production in the Odessa Sub-area and associated loss of potato processing. Summary and conclusions are in the final section.

N2  - Beneficial management practices (BMPs) are designed to minimize environmental impacts and provide on- and off-farm benefits such as improved farm economics and enhanced water quality for domestic consumption, recreation and healthier aquatic ecosystems. Adoption of BMPs depends on the willingness of producers to implement them and on producer capacity to finance the investment. The Watershed Evaluation of Beneficial Management Practices (WEBs) project was initiated in 2004 under Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) to investigate water quality issues and economics related to agricultural production. The project selected nine watersheds across the country where BMPs were implemented to determine the effect on water quality in terms of nutrients, pathogens and sediment and on-farm economics. The South Tobacco Creek (STC) watershed, located in southern Manitoba, was one of the nine watersheds selected. Several BMPs were investigated in STC, including land management changes, the use of small dams and retention ponds to control the runoff from livestock yards from entering the water ways. The objective of the WEBs STC economics component was to assess on-farm economic costs and to identify and assess potential on-farm and off-farm benefits of applying the selected BMPs. The STC economic results have shown that some of the BMPs tested contribute positively to improved farm economics and financial returns but there are some BMPs whose revenues will not fully offset BMP costs. Certain off-farm benefits resulting from BMP implementation have also been identified. Reduced tillage BMP was shown to have significant benefits to producers based on combined experimental and model results. For the small dam/reservoir BMP the net present value based on only flood damage control was shown that the financial payback period can be less than 35 years. Significant additional potential benefits in terms of irrigation, sediment and nutrient entrapment, and recreational activities have also been determined. For land conversion to forage BMP, the cost saving of inclusion of forage to annual crop rotation was not enough to compensate the loss of opportunity through the loss of net income in annual crops. Similarly, the farm benefit of the holding pond which built to capture run-off from an upstream winter cattle containment area was not enough to justify its instalment cost, although nutrients, sediment and pathogens export (off-farm benefits) were reduced significantly. The STC research provided producers, governments, and watershed groups with credible information that can be used to promote adopting and maintaining BMPs.

Household-level water use data for Alachua County, Florida, were analyzed using three methods: IV, 2SLS, and 3SLS. Residential water demand is examined separately for households with combined water meters, as well as separate indoor and outdoor irrigation water meters. Preliminary results show that the price-base program (i.e., inclining block rate pricing) and non-price programs (i.e., residential irrigation restrictions with an enforcement component) have a significant effect on monthly household water use.

N2  - Kenya joined the ranks of sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries implementing a targeted input subsidy program for inorganic fertilizer and improved seed in 2007 with
the establishment of the National Accelerated Agricultural Inputs Access Program’s “Kilimo Plus” initiative. Implemented from 2007/08, Kilimo Plus aimed to provide 50 kg each of basal and top dressing fertiliser, and 10 kg of improved maize seed to resource poor smallholder farmers with the goals of increasing access to inputs,raising yields and incomes, improving food security, and reducing poverty. But did the program achieve its goals, and what are the lessons learned from Kilimo Plus and other targeted input subsidy programs (ISPs) in SSA for the design and implementation of future county-level input policies and programs in Kenya? Results suggest that, despite replacing what would have been commercial fertilizer purchases by farmers, Kilimo Plus did substantially increase maize production and reduce poverty depth and severity of recipient households. Moreover, the program’s positive effects are somewhat larger than those of targeted ISPs in Malawi and Zambia. Much of Kilimo Plus’s
relative success vis-à-vis the Malawi and Zambia programs is likely due to its effective targeting of relatively resource-poor farmers and its implementation through
vouchers redeemable at private agro-dealer shops. Kenyan counties considering implementing ISPs should bear in mind these findings, but also carefully weigh the cost
effectiveness of ISPs relative to other much-needed investments, including rural roads and agricultural research, development, and extension. Indeed, since Kilimo Plus
alone is not sufficient to bring households out of poverty, a more holistic approach to improving production and sustainable intensification is required. This may imply use of vouchers for other crops and inputs, particularly those which enhance soil health such as lime, as well as an increase in complementary public/private investments in
research, extension, irrigation, transport infrastructure, information, and affordable and appropriate innovations.

N2  - This paper is to clarify the formation of early irrigation associations in the colonial Korea, focusing on the case study of Chonik(全益) Irrigation Association. From the early 1910s, there used to be a traditional-style irrigation system called bo(洑) in Ch’unp’o myon, Iksan County, Jeonbuk province. Chonik Association was little innovative in irrigation techniques, but it brought about certain important changes in managing the institution. First of all, it was the Japanese rather than Koreans who initiated a modern system of association. Chonik Association carried out large river projects for regional development too. The Mangyong River improvement project started in its middle reach in 1925. The initial project was further extended by five years to develop the lower reach and a tributary(Iksan Stream) of the river as well. This water project combined with the irrigation project enhanced much a synergic effect. However, given the well-established and highly effective irrigation association, the regional rural society far surpassed other ordinary Korean villages in agricultural environments. The dilemma of the colonial development was that as their influences in the region deepened, so the gap between them and neighboring villages widened.

N2  - Abstract Despite large-scale public investment on research and technology adoption, as an effort to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, rural poverty and vulnerability remain widespread in Ethiopia. Using three-round panel data between 2012 and 2016, this paper employed fixed effects and multinomial logit models to assess the effect of agricultural technologies and practices on consumption expenditure, poverty and vulnerability. The fixed effects model results indicate that use of chemical fertilizer, pesticides, improved seed, terracing and irrigation significantly influenced per capita consumption expenditure. The multinomial logit marginal effect estimates shows likelihood of chronic poverty decreased with the use of improved seed, chemical fertilizer, and contour plough, whereas, the use of irrigation reduced the likelihood of being vulnerable. We therefore conclude that agricultural technology dissemination through government supported programs has substantial dynamic benefits in reducing poverty and vulnerability. We suggest that much more intervention is needed to ensure that poor households exit poverty and protect the vulnerable from falling into poverty over time. It is crucial that smallholder farmer s especially the poor and the vulnerable households access to agricultural technologies and infrastructure (roads and irrigation) be improved.

N2  - We examine the effects of irrigation technology subsidies using a model of inter-
temporal common pool groundwater use with substitutable technology and declining
yields from groundwater stocks, where pumping cost and stock externalities arise from
the common property problem. We employ an optimal control analytical model, which
is then parameterized and simulated for Sheridan County, Kansas, which overlies the
Ogallala aquifer. We contrast competitive and optimal allocations and account for
endogenous and time-varying irrigation capital on water use and stock. In our anal-
ysis, we account for the labor-savings from improved irrigation technologies, which is
an often overlooked reduction in adoption costs. We find that in the absence of pol-
icy intervention, the open access solution yields an early period with underinvestment
in efficiency-improving irrigation technology relative to the socially efficient solution,
which is followed by a period of overinvestment. This suggests a potential role for ir-
rigation capital subsidies to improve welfare over certain ranges of the state variables.
In contrast to previous work, we find evidence that significant returns may be achieved
from policy intervention. We go on to simulate various policy scenarios where irriga-tion technology subsidies implemented in isolation and in combination with water use
restrictions, to explore whether simple implementation of these programs can capture
significant portions of the potential welfare gain.

N2  - Turkey is a major agricultural player and serves as an important food hub for its neighboring countries in the water-scarce Middle East and North African region. However, partly due to a lack of natural pasture land, the Turkish livestock sector exhibits low productivity, and this is why the Turkish government has introduced various policies in support of this sector, including direct payments to irrigated fodder crops such as maize for silage. In order to assess the effect of these policies, a single country CGE model has been linked to a water footprint module. Results suggest that removal of Turkish subsidies and tariffs that currently support the livestock sector may not lead to water savings in absolute terms, but would redirect a substantial amount of irrigation water towards crops that Turkey can produce more competitively. Also, it is found that programs for the improvement of livestock genetics in Turkey may lead to net economic gains and overall water savings.

N2  - This study assessed the variability of flows under present and 'naturalized' basin conditions in the Upper Ganges Basin (UGB). Furthermore, the PRECIS regional climate model (RCM) was used to generate climate projections for the UGB, with subsequent simulations of future river flows. Results show that the annual average precipitation, actual evapotranspiration (ET) and net water yields of the whole basin were 1,192 mm, 416 mm and 615 mm, respectively. Precipitation, ET and water yields were found to be higher in the forested and mountainous upper areas of the UGB. On an annual average, present-day flows throughout UGB are about 2-8% lower than under naturalized conditions. Dry and wet season flows under climate change (CC) scenario A2 are lower than that under present climate conditions at upstream locations, but higher at downstream locations of UGB. Flows under CC scenario B2 are systematically higher and lower than that under CC scenario A2 during dry and wet seasons, respectively.

N1  - Presented at the 19th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Washington DC, USA
N2  - We evaluate the impact of water scarcity on food prices, deforestation and bioenergy production under a global carbon policy. The analysis develops a representation of irrigated land in the MIT Economic Project and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a global economy-wide model of energy and food production, land-use change and greenhouse gas emissions. The representation relies on the specification of irrigable land supply curves, which are built on detailed spatial estimates of water availability, and the costs of improving irrigation efficiency and increasing water storage. Simulating the model under a global carbon price, as there are endogenous improvements in irrigation infrastructure, we find that water availability has a small impact on food, deforestation and bioenergy outcomes. We also find that, relative to when irrigated land is not represented, heterogeneity in irrigation responses result in livestock production relocating from more land-intensive regions to less land-intensive regions, which leads to less deforestation.

N2  - This paper combines a structural estimation of vegetative-agriculture supply, based on a farmland-allocation model, with a market-level partial equilibrium demand model, to simulate the effects of climate change on agricultural production and food prices. The supply estimation accounts for corner solutions associated with disaggregate land-use data, enabling the treatment of prices as exogenous. The explicit formulation of production and output prices enables linkage to the demand, as well as the exploitation of market-level data so as to assign production interpretation to the estimated coefficients of the land-use model. We use the model to assess climate-change impacts in Israel, where agriculture is protected by import tariffs. We find that the projected climate changes are beneficial to farmers, particularly due to the positive impact of the forecasted large temperature rise on field-crop production. Fruit outputs are projected to decline, and reduce consumer surplus, but to a lower extent than the increase in total agricultural profits. Nearly 20% of the profit rise is attributed to farmers’ adaptation through land reallocation. Adaptation to the projected reduction in precipitation by increasing irrigation is found to be warranted from the farmers’ perspective; however, it is not beneficial to society as a whole. Abolishing import tariffs effectively transfers surpluses from producers to consumers, but the impact of this policy on social welfare becomes positive only under scenarios of large climate change.

N2  - This study introduces an improved global economic framework for investigating the impacts of climate change while focusing on local water constraints and international trade of agricultural products. This study measures the likely impacts of a counterfactual change in “irrigation yield gap” on irrigation expansion, groundwater withdrawal, surface water withdrawal, and international trade of agricultural commodities. We construct proposed economic framework based on GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) model, a widely used global model, to investigate various economic impacts. We extend GTAP Water Data Base (Haqiqi et al., 2016) by adding new global database on irrigation efficiency; introducing irrigation services as sectors; new global database of costs and returns of irrigation; introducing energy, capital, and labor inputs for water extraction and on-farm water distribution; distinguishing surface water from groundwater; and considering different irrigation technologies. We also introduce demand and supply of irrigation services by river basin AEZs (agro-ecological zones). Then, we calculate the likely impact of a counterfactual scenario of climate change (change in relative yields of irrigated and non-irrigated crops).

N2  - We investigated the impacts of piped water on water quality, sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes in marginalized rural households of north-western Bangladesh using a quasi-experimental analysis. A government organization – the Barindra Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) – established a piped water network to provide these rural households with improved water as they have poor access to potable water. Using propensity score matching, the study compares a treatment and a control group of households to identify gains in water-sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes. We found that the BMDA piped water infrastructure had a positive impact on access to improved water and significantly reduced the distance traveled for and time spent on collecting drinking water. However, we found no improvement in the drinking water quality, which was measured by the extent of fecal contamination (E. coli count per 100 ml of water) at the point of use. The hygiene status of food utensils also did not show any improvement; food utensils were tested positive for E. coli in both the control and treatment group. Although access to BMDA piped water in the premises involves cost, it didn’t improve hygiene behavior: handwashing with soap after defecation and before feeding children. The treated households own larger water containers which implies that the intervention has had a clear impact on the quantity of water used for household purposes. However, we did not find evidence of health benefits, such as decreased diarrhea incidence of in under-five children, improved child anthropometrics stunting, underweight and wasting of children due to piped water use.

major Nebraska Watersheds (the Republican and Central Platte) over the 2000 to 2008
time period. The sales were spatially referenced (digitized into a GIS) in order to quantify
and geo-spatially predict and map the implicit values of irrigation through the use of
hedonic price modeling. Marginal implicit prices vary substantially across subwatersheds
(natural resource districts), and the contribution of irrigation to sale prices is
directly related to the extent to dependency of production agriculture on irrigation.
This information is now currently being used to evaluate the economic efficiency of
recent irrigation retirement programs and to help ensure that current and future retirement
programs are cost-effective through targeting that retires irrigation land with the greatest
hydrologic impact on water resources for the lowest cost.

This information was provided to assist in evaluating the timing and mix of irrigation infrastructure investments under consideration by dairy framers in the Lower Murray Irrigation Area and the South Australian Government.
Possible future milk prices received and water rights (including allocations and trade restrictions), together with possible improvements in on farm productivity are assumed in this regionally based model.
The model results suggest that some dairy farmers will consider withdrawing from dairying and selling water allocation under a range of potential future milk and water prices.

N2  - Despite the continued production and overdependence of traditional crops mainly maize and wheat as main source of income in the Uasin-Gishu County, poverty among farmers has been increasing. To mitigate the poverty effects, farmers have tended to substitute land under the traditional crops for high yielding and high value crops passion fruit inclusive. However, the uptake of passion fruit has been achieved with partial success. This study examined factors affecting passion fruit adoption and the extent of adoption. It further investigated the comparative profitability of passion fruit crop vis-à-vis other farm enterprises contingent on available farm resources. Cross-sectional data from 100 randomly selected farmers were collected and subjected to Heckman two-step regression analysis to determine factors affecting passion fruit adoption as well as the extent of adoption. Gross Margin Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis methods were used to assess the comparative profitability of passion fruit crop. The results showed that availability of water for irrigation, title deeds and farming as main occupation significantly and positively affected the adoption of passion fruit while age was significant with negative effect. Private land ownership and access to extension services significantly and positively influenced the extent of adoption while age had significant negative effect. Further, this study revealed that passion fruit production was the more profitable farm enterprise than other comparable farm enterprises. The results mean more incentives and innovative drivers are necessary for crop diversification and substitution in Kenya and not sufficient for adoption of the new crops. Government and other stakeholders should formulate and implement effective policies related to promotion of adoption, production and marketing of new agricultural technologies.

N2  - Although it is known that access to physical infrastructure enhances household welfare, there are hardly any micro-econometric studies that analyze the role of infrastructure in mitigating chronic and transient poverty. This paper aims to bridge this gap in the existing literature by evaluating the impact of a large-scale irrigation project implemented in Sri Lanka. We extend the seasonal consumption smoothing model of Paxson (1993) by introducing endogenous credit constraints. We collected unique household-level monthly panel data over a period of two years. According to the point estimates, with irrigation accessibility, per capita food and non-food consumption expenditures increase by around 20% and 45%, respectively, on average, and the probability of binding credit constraint is reduced by 5.6% during the dry season. The latter result implies that irrigation enhances households’ access to the credit market which, in turn, contributes to further reduction in transient poverty. These empirical results suggest that irrigation infrastructure has a positive impact on reducing both chronic and transient poverty. The structural estimation results support the validity of our theoretical framework.

N2  - In recent years there has been a flurry of activity aimed at evaluating the land use consequences of biofuels programs and the associated carbon releases. In this paper we argue that these studies have tended to underestimate the ensuing land use emissions, because they have ignored the role of irrigation, and associated constraints on cropland expansion. In this paper, we develop a new general equilibrium model which distinguishes irrigated and rain fed cropping industries at a global scale. Using the new model we evaluate the implications of land use change due to US ethanol programs, in the context of physical constraints on the expansion of irrigated cropland. We find that models which mingle irrigated and rain fed areas underestimate the global land use changes induced due to the US ethanol expansion by about 5.7%. They tend to underestimate the corresponding land use emissions by more than one fifth.

N2  - The amount of water used for irrigation has sharply declined during transition in Bulgaria. Large sections of existing irrigation systems were abandoned, and the ones still in use are barely maintained. Crops such as wheat and barley have replaced more water-intensive crops, including vegetables, rice and maize. This problem has an impact on the future development of agriculture and the allocation of the country's water resources. The central argument is that land fragmentation in the wake of de-collectivization and restitution contributes to the irrigation systems' abandonment. This paper concentrates on the institutional factors, but also considers additional factors, that may have influenced the process; further, it examines the causes driving these changes and analyses their effect on irrigation. It is based upon a review of relevant legislation, as well as field work in 17 villages located in the Plovdiv region of Bulgaria. The paper concludes that, in addition to changes in large-scale market forces and weakening of the state enforcement mechanism, institutional settings have contributed to the decline of irrigation in Bulgaria.

N2  - The present study shows a methodology analysing the role plaid by information in conditioning the criteria used to schedule irrigation by farmers. The method is applied to the problem of comparing advanced instruments (advice services) and prevailing current practices (calendar irrigation) in valuing and predicting soil water content to schedule irrigation. Such assessment approach brought to the formulation of two main hypotheses: a) the message service is valuable if those messages with higher failure consequences are enough accurate to drive decisions; b) The use of information services to plan irrigation is favoured by the increasing frequencies of irrigation intervention because of the relatively lower expected consequences of failing to meet predictions. This methodology was applied to few pilot experiments. Observed impacts substantiate model hypothesis, revealing that the introduction of advanced information systems is favoured in sub-arid climate regions and for drip irrigated crops, where it was recorded a 0% to 20% increase in gross margin and a 10% to 30% water saving. The study concludes addressing the condition justifying the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation intervention and offering some policy recommendation to drive the development and the early adoption of such technologies .

N2  - The paper shows that in a comparison between supermarket channels (working via dedicated wholesalers) and traditional channels, farmers selling to supermarkets tend to be in the upper-end of the "small farmer" category (whereas the traditional-channel growers are in the smaller end), have more capital (in particular, irrigation, which allows them to supply all year and attain greater productivity and consistency), and be much more specialized in commercial horticulture in general and in tomatoes in particular, as compared to the traditional farmers. While they have higher yields, they also have higher input use, including use of chemicals, and these greater input expenditures (accompanied by more credit and technical assistance from the chemical companies) means that their profit rate is roughly similar to the farmers in the traditional channel. They tell us that they prefer still the more demanding wholesale-supermarket channel because it offers a lower risk and lower transaction cost outlet for the variety of their qualities and grades, all year. In turn, the supermarkets, who do not buy direct but rather source from a few dedicated wholesalers, rely on this year-round supply, lower transaction costs, and consistency. While the share of supermarkets in the produce market in Guatemala is still minor, these results mean merely that the more capitalized-tier of small farmers enjoy some advantages with the new channel, but also some entry costs that the traditional farmers as of yet do not face. As the supermarket channel grows, it is expected that more and more farmers will need to capitalized in ways that will either make them competitive in the new market, or in the traditional markets that will doubtless evolve to maintain competitiveness themselves. Development programs over the medium-long run will need to take into account the changing nature of farm-level investments thus implied.

N2  - The overall objectives of our proposed paper is to: (a) systematically document the post-reform trends in agricultural performance in Asia, Europe, and the Former Soviet Union; (b) identify the main reform strategies and institutional innovations that have contributed to the successes and failures of the sector; (c) analyze the mechanisms by which reform policies and initial conditions have affected the transition process in agriculture; and (d) draw lessons and policy implications from the experiment and identify the gaps in our understanding of the role and performance of agriculture in transition. As part of this effort, we attempt to address a number of intriguing and important questions on the performance of individual countries or regions during transition. Why has China been so successful in its reforms, while Russia has not? Why is it that some CEECs have rebounded and showing robust productivity growth, while others have not? Why has agriculture in so many FSU nations continued to perform so poorly? In addition, we will address questions about the process of reform. Why has land restitution predominated in Europe but not in Russia or China? Why did institutions of exchange collapse in the non-Asian economies in the early stages of reform but continued to function in Vietnam and China? What explains the apparent divergence in the performance effects after the first year of reform in China and Vietnam, on the one hand, and much of the rest of the transitional world on the other? In particular, how have land reform and rural input-supply/ procurement enterprise restructuring affected productivity? Which institutions of exchange and contracting have or have not emerged, and why? How has the structure of the economy at the outset of transition, and other initial conditions, affected the transition process? To meet our objectives and answer some of the questions, we will begin by laying out the record on performance - examining the main bodies of data that demonstrate the changes in agricultural output, income, and productivity in the years after transition. In doing so, we will show how some of the countries have recorded similar performances, while others have developed quite differently. We will identify several "patterns of transition" based on these performance indicators and much of our subsequent discussion will analyze the success of transition according to these classifications. Next, as the first step in our search for answers as to what explains these different patterns, we examine differences in the points of departure of the transition countries as well as the nature of the policy reforms that have affected agriculture. The initial conditions that we hypothesize may explain part of the transition period's performance include the nature of agricultural technology at the beginning of the reforms (its scale; its labor intensiveness; etc.), the structure of the economy (the extent of industrialization), the extent of collectivization, and the magnitude of trade distortions. The key policy interventions that we should expect to affect agriculture's performance during transition include land right reforms and farm restructuring; price and subsidization policies; the approach to the liberalization of agricultural commodity and input markets; general macro-economic and general institutional reforms; and the attention of sectoral leaders to the level of new and maintenance-oriented public goods investment (in agricultural research, irrigation, roads, and other infrastructure projects). After documenting the dramatic differences in initial conditions and in reform policies among the transitional countries, we seek to demonstrate which of the differences determine the path a country's agriculture takes. In other words, we offer answers to the question why transition in agriculture in some countries has been successful and not in others. Here, we seek to generalize about the main causes for differences between the countries and the mechanisms that have affected performance. In particular, we argue that the debate on the optimality of Big-Bang versus gradualism oversimplifies the reform problem. The empirical evidence suggests that the road to a successful transition is more subtle and successful transitions in Asia and Europe have elements of both gradual and radical reforms. To explain the reform successes and failures we emphasize the role of the political environment in the early reform years and the potential for agricultural growth that exists at the start of reforms. We find that both have not only influenced the choice of the reform policies, but also the effect of the reform policies. We also conclude that the initial level of price distortions and the pace of market liberalization were especially influential in explaining differences in the early stages of transition but that the influence of the factors has diminished over time. Investment, land rights, and farm restructuring policies, in contrast, are assuming a more important role as the agricultural reforms have matured. In the last section we draw policy implications and lessons from the agricultural transition experiences. We argue that one should be careful about which indicator to use for measuring success and failure of transition. We conclude that all reform strategies in order to be successful need to include some certain policy ingredients (such as continued investment, etc.). However, a powerful lesson is that although all the pieces are ultimately needed, there is a lot of room for variation in the form of institutions that can be successful, and optimal policies and institutions may vary according to initial conditions. In other words, there is no single optimal transition path.

N2  - This paper examines the effect of changes in climatic averages on agricultural production at
the national level in Cameroon. The empirical results reveal that Cameroon’s agriculture is
influenced by climate variables. The economic value of the projected output in 2050 ranges
from USD3.5 billion (41% less than the 1961–2001 mean value at 2.5oC increase in
temperature and 8.5% increase in precipitation) to US$ 7.1 billion (18.5% greater than the
1961–2001 mean, for a 1.5°C increase in temperature and a 15% increase in precipitation). A
3.5% increase in temperature associated with a 4.5% increase in precipitation in the absence
of irrigation facilities would be detrimental to Cameroon’s agriculture, leading to a loss of
almost 46.7% in output value. This would negatively affect the economy as a whole, since
close to 30% of Cameroon’s national GDP comes from agriculture.

N2  - Small-scale farmers play a vital role in providing food for a growing urbanized population and improving food security in Southern Africa. The smallholder farms are highly heterogeneous in terms of types of farming, levels of productivity and commercialization. These heterogeneous groups of smallholder faming systems require different forms of government interventions, depending on the objective and characteristics of each group. The aim of this paper is to analyze the typologies of small-scale farmers in South Africa based on a wide range of objective variables regarding their personal, farm and context characteristics, which support an effective, target-group-specific design and communication of policies. For this, a cluster analysis is conducted on the basis of a comprehensive survey among 212 small-scale farmers in the Limpopo region in 2019. An unsupervised machine learning approach with Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) for the subsequent clustering is used. According to the results, the small-scale farmers can be grouped into four clusters. The largest cluster with 37.7% of the farmers represents the group of subsistence oriented farmers, while the smallest cluster with 14% of respondents indicates the emerging (commercial-oriented) farmers. The other two clusters are the semi-subsistence livestock farmers as well as the and crop oriented farmers that predominantly producing for own consumption and selling their surplus at their farm. According to the results, implications for target-group-specific policies are exemplary derived with regards to the topics of extension services, the adaptation of irrigation technologies and credit access.

N2  - The MIT Integrated Global System Model framework, extended to include a Water Resource System component, is used for an integrated assessment of the effects of alternative climate policy scenarios on U.S. water systems. Climate patterns that are relatively wet and dry over the US are explored. Climate results are downscaled to yield estimates of surface runoff for 99 river basins in the continental U.S., which are combined with estimated groundwater supplies. An 11- region economic model sets conditions driving water requirements estimates for five sectors, with detailed sub-models employed for analysis of irrigation and thermoelectric power generation. The water system of interconnected basins is operated to minimize water stress. Results suggest that, with or without climate change, U.S. average annual water stress is expected to increase over the period 2041 to 2050, primarily because of an increase in water requirements. The largest water stresses are projected in the Southwest. Policy to lower atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations has a beneficial effect, reducing water stress intensity and variability in the concerned basins.

N2  - The Tana River is one of Kenya’s most important rivers. It is the principal water source for Nairobi, the capital city, providing water for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation. Several of the flagship projects laid out in Vision 2030 - the blueprint that guides Kenya’s national development – are located in the basin. This report presents the findings of a study to determine the possible impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the basin. Data from seven Regional Circulation Models (RCMs), simulating two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), were used as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. For both RCPs, rainfall is projected to increase across the basin over the remainder of the twenty-first century. Associated increases in water yield, groundwater recharge and baseflow point to an improved water resource situation in the future. However, declining natural flow regulation, increased variability, and considerable increases in the frequency and magnitude of floods pose a risk that threatens to undermine development opportunities. Water resource management will be much more difficult than under historic climatic conditions.

N2  - Indiscriminate and over use of pesticide imposes severe long-term risk to human beings. The exposure level (0.018 mg/kg/day) of pesticides in Bangladesh is much higher than that of expected (0.005 mg/kg/day). Runoff, spillage and leaching of pesticides from agricultural fields contribute pesticide residues in surface and ground water. Ground water and surface water vulnerability in the case of DDT and Atrazine were carried out. Application of 1 to 1.12 kg/ha for Atrazine in low land rice field areas imposes moderate risk on ground water. Adulteration of pesticides in ponds, drainage from irrigation project causes toxicity to fish species and vegetables. Considerable amount of organochlorine insecticides were found in water samples of depressions near rice fields, which indicate lack of control mechanisms. Presence of significant amount of pesticide residue in food, dry fish etc. are matter of concern. The residue of pesticide in human body due to consumption of. rice and wheat was estimated to be 0.62x10-5 mg/day/person. Shetu Pesticide Formulation Ltd., Savar has been observed as a case study and the concept of Pollution Prevention Program (PPP) (EPA, 1982) has been reviewed for the management of industrial waste.

Hyderabad, India: International Water Management Institute (IWMI), South Asia Sub Regional Office
N2  - This paper analyzes the potential impacts of energy pricing on efficiency, equity and sustainability in
groundwater use. The analysis uses empirical data on water productivity in agriculture for crops, dairying and farms
for north Gujarat, east US and south Bihar. For north Gujarat, the analysis uses data from well owners who pay flat
rate tariff, and well owners who pay pro-rata tariff. For eastern UP and south Bihar, the analysis uses data from well
owners and water buyers from diesel and electric well commands. The analysis also compares data from diesel well
owners and electric well owners in south Bihar. The findings are as follows:
Introducing marginal cost for electricity motivates farmers to use water more efficiently at the farm level
through careful use of irrigation water; use of better agronomic inputs; optimize costly inputs; optimize livestock
composition and carefully select crops and cropping patterns, which give higher return from every unit of water and
grow low water consuming crops. It also shows that higher cost of irrigation water (because of higher energy cost)
will not lower net return from every unit of water used as the farmers will modify their farming system accordingly.
Further, change in the structure of power tariff from flat rate to pro-rata will not have any adverse effects on
access and equity in groundwater use. Nor will it increase the monopoly power of well owners. The number of
potential water sellers and not the number of potential buyers of water govern the price of water. Pro-rata pricing
reduces cost of groundwater pumping per unit of land. It also reduces aggregate pumping, which is disproportionately
higher than the reduction in net returns per unit of land. This leads to more sustainable groundwater use.
This means that in water scarce regions, it would be possible for farmers to maintain net farm surpluses at
higher energy tariff by improving productivity of water use. The empirical evidence further reinforces that the
arguments against pro-rata pricing are flawed. Raising power tariff in the farm sector to achieve efficiency, equity and
sustainability in groundwater use is socially and economically viable.

N2  - The North China Plain (NCP) covers an area of around 328,000 km2 and is one of the most important regions of cereal crop production in China. Wheat and maize rotations and one season cotton are the most common cropping systems. The region contributes at an amount of about 50% to the countries wheat production and about one third of maize yields. Crop production in the NCP was focused in the last decades on increasing yields to meet the growing food demand accompanied by the limitation of arable land as a result of urbanization rate i.e. of the Beijing District. Food production needs can nowadays only be achieved by the optimization of agricultural management, i.e. fertilizer input, irrigation, improved crop rotations. The focus on increasing yields raised serious environmental problems, like water shortage and pollution, air pollution and soil contamination. Hence the development of future land use system approaches improving these conditions is essentially. This may provide both a high production level as well as a protection of resources. The multidisciplinary collaborative International Research Training Group project (IRTG) “Modelling Material Flows and Production Systems for Sustainable Resource Use in Intensified Crop Production in the North China Plain”, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the Chinese Ministry of Education, was launched to detect the potential of adjustments in cropping systems and to further develop management practices for sustainable resource use and protection of environmental conditions while assuring a high yield level. The here presented research concentrates on the construction of a modelling framework of different spatial-temporal scales in order to regionalize the detected key features and the effects of changing land use patterns.
In order to investigate our research objective, the regionalisation of key features towards sustainable agricultural and to improve productivity in the NCP (North China Plain) we primarily have to identify these core features. On the economic site we determine “farmer income” to be an appropriate factor. The ecological site is served by the determination of “water use efficiency” (WUE) and yield. Both factors have to be further verified on their plausibility for our research aim by project member discussion. Next an evaluation of multiple computational approaches towards their practicability was investigated. Relay on both existing GIS data in the projects AIES data base and additional data provided by our Chinese Agricultural University (CAU) colleagues. Primarily the Cellular Automata (CA) concept based on previous work as well as statistical analyses, Data mining and cell neighbourhood relations was investigated. This approach has to be denied due to insignificant neighbourhood relations and the fact that no appropriate computing environment was found. Secondly a model combination of Markov Chain and Cellular Automata as it is proposed by remote sensing software techniques (IDRISI 15.0) has been evaluated. This approach combines stochastic probabilities for cell transitions with classical GIS facilities. Again no statistic significance of spatial transitions due to farmer decisions is found. The 3rd actual approach Multi Agent System (MAS) is believed to be the most promising for several reasons. We chose NetLogo 4.0.3 as appropriate computing environment. First it includes GIS data extensions, above this it is a powerful free designable and Java programmable cross-platform user interface. The hypothesis is the following, Multi-Agents (farmers) acting in space, interfere and interact in spatial scales corrupting their entities (arable land) and thus their income. We have parameterised soil and defined agricultural activity zones. Agents now are aware of their own productivity value and compete with direct neighbours.
For future purposes the ecological key features WUE and yield will be investigate by the use of the DSSAT crop model. As a group of scientist actually use the DSSAT crop model in varying plant sciences, certain expertises are generated in our project. This and the author personal expertise will help for a sudden parameterisation and integration of AEIS GIS dataset parameters.

N2  - Conceptual development in the theory of
externalities have opened up several policy options for
their internalization including payment towards
environmental services. Hence as externalities are social
costs, accountability is crucial in increasing

estimate externalities in water, forests and environment
with field data from peninsular India to reflect on the
economic perception of externalities by farmers and
users of environment for the consideration of policy
makers to devise institutions for payment towards
environmental services.
The methodology largely used here in estimation /
valuation of externalities is by considering ‘with –
without’ situations (including ‘before – after’ in some
cases) akin to ‘project valuation’. Studies cover
empirical estimation of externalities inter alia due to
over extraction of groundwater , sand mining, watershed
development, conservation of forests, sacred groves,
cultivation of organic coffee, use of medicinal plants as
alternate medicines and the annual values presented are
in 2008 prices.
The negative externality due to sand mining 24 € per
acre, that due to distillery effluent pollution is 34 € per
acre. The positive externality due to watershed program
is around 51 € per acre, and that due to rehabilitation of
irrigation tanks is 26 € per acre. The positive
externality due to cultivation of shade coffee is 9 € per
acre and that due to forest conservation 27 € per acre.
The positive externality due to sacred grove
conservation was 12 € per family. The impact of forest
conservation on Non timber forest products was 88 € /
per tribal household. The positive externality due to use
of medicinal plants as alternate medicine is equal to 35 €
per patient suffering from osteo-arthritis and 19 € per
patient suffering from peptic-ulcer.
While these estimates are not sacro sanct as the
methodologies for valuation of externalities are subject
to further review and improvement, they however serve
as initial indicators of spillovers. And they signal
possibilities for consideration of policy makers for
devising alternate institutions for potential payment

N2  - Although irrigation projects often provide water for more than crop irrigation, water allocation and management decisions often do not account for nonirrigation uses of water. Failure to account for the multiple uses of irrigation water may result in inefficient and inequitable water allocation decisions. Decision-makers often lack information on the relative economic contributions of water in irrigation and nonirrigation uses. This report addresses this problem. It examines the relative economic contributions of irrigated agriculture and reservoir fisheries in the Kirindi Oya irrigation system, located in southeastern Sri Lanka. The results of the analysis indicate the importance of both irrigated paddy production and reservoir fisheries to the local economy. They also demonstrate significant potential financial and economic gains to irrigated agriculture from improvements in water management practices.

N2  - A Gazdálkodás folyóirat 2014. évi 1. számában vitát indítottunk „Hatékonyság és foglalkoztatás a magyar mezőgazdaságban” címmel (Mészáros - Szabó, 2014). A vita célját a következőkben fogalmaztuk meg: „a vitának elsősorban a hatékonyság és a fog- lalkoztatásjavításánakesélyeire és eszközeire, másrészt a két gazdasági kategória párhuzamos vagy eltérő súlyú szerepére kellene irányulnia” (i. m. 59.). A magunk részéről kétféle alapvető országos szintű mezőgazdaság-fejlesztési stratégiát különböztettünk meg: az egyik a hatékonyságorientált, a másik a foglalkoztatásorientált fejlesztés volt. Ugyanakkor megjegyeztük: „A kétféle cél között különböző kombinációk képzelhetőkel, azok megvalósítását pedig egymástól eltérő stratégiák szolgálhatják.” (i. m. 70.) A vita kiterjedését igyekeztünk úgy korlátozni, hogy az csak a magyarországi helyzetre, az agrárgazdaságon belül csak a mezőgazdaságra irányuljon, a környezet kérdéseivel pedig csupán érintőlegesen foglalkozzon. Elmondhatjuk, hogy a vitaindító cikk élénk érdeklődést váltott ki, mivel az eltelt mintegy egyéves időszakban nyolc hozzászólásjelent meg a Gazdálkodás folyóiratban, összesen 17 szerző tollából. Vitazáró cikkünkben elsősorban e hozzászólásokat értékeljük, egyetértve vagy vitázva a szerzőkkel, majd igyekszünk összegezni a vita tanulságait, emellett a következő javaslatokat fogalmazzuk meg az agrárirányítás, illetve a további kutatómunka számára.
1. Mezőgazdaságunk termelési szerkezetének belterjes irányú fejlesztése régóta fontos célkitűzésnek számított, de manapság még inkább kiemelt feladatot képez az egyre élesedő nemzetközi versenyben. A mezőgazdasági foglalkoztatás növelésének egyik legkézenfekvőbb lehetősége a belterjesítés. 2. Fontos és sürgető feladat az élelmiszeripar átfogó és dinamikus fejlesztése is, követve Lengyelország példáját. 3. A hatékonyság és a foglalkoztatás nélkülözhetetlen feltétele a termelők, vagyis a mezőgazdasági dolgozók szakképzettségének, valamint a szaktanácsadás színvonalának emelése. 4. A szaktudás emelésére, korszerűsítésére azonban a legfelső szinten is szükség van, ideértve az egyetemek, doktori iskolák, kutatóintézetek munkatársait is. Ezért szélesebb körben ismertté és használatossá kellene tenni például azokat az új és korszerű elemzési módszereket, amelyeket hozzászólásukban Fertő Imre és Baráth Lajos (2014) a gazdasági hatékonyság és a külkereskedelmi versenyképesség vizsgálatában használt. 5. A kis- és közepes gazdaságok társulási készségének erősítését az egyik kiemelten fontos agrárpolitikai célkitűzésként kell kezelni. 6. A foglalkoztatási problémák regionális kezelése külön figyelmet igényel. 7. Fontosnak tartjuk a jövőben a környezet- és természetvédelem szempontjainak fokozott figyelembevételét és érvényesítését mezőgazdaságunkban. Ilyen kérdés lehet például a klímaváltozásra (felmelegedésre) való felkészülés, ami erdősítést, mezővédő erdősávok létesítését, öntözőtelepek és víztározók célzott telepítését stb. jelenti, s az ilyen programok nem nélkülözhetik a kormányzati (állami) közreműködést és beruházásokat sem. ----------------------------- We launched a debate article in the 2014/1 issue of Gazdálkodás entitled “Efficiency and employment in Hungarian agriculture”. We defined the purpose of the debate as follows: “The discussion and debate should focus on the opportunities and means of improvement of employment and effectiveness” (ibid p. 59). For our part, we distinguished between two national-level agricultural development strategies: efficiency-oriented and employment- oriented development. We tried to limit the scope of the debate to only the situation in Hungary, only agriculture, while merely touching on environmental issues.
It is fair to say that our keynote article raised keen interest, as the eight reply articles were published in the journal in the following 12 months, penned by 17 different authors. In this closing article we wish to evaluate the comments, agree or disagree with the authors, and formulate recommendations for agricultural decision makers and ideas for further research. One of the findings was that while the debate has come to an end in the Gazdálkodás journal, it should continue on in other forums, for the benefit and education of experts and the further development and improvement of Hungarian agriculture.
We have collected the following proposals, mainly based on the papers we received, which are particularly important and timely for the future development of Hungarian agriculture.
The intensified development of the production structure of Hungarian agriculture has long been an important goal, but has become more so at present given the increasingly fierce international competition. One of the most obvious methods of increasing employment in agricultural is through intensification.
Following the example of Poland, the development of a comprehensive and dynamic food industry is a crucial and important task.
Training highly qualified farm workers and improving the quality of the advice they receive is necessary for effectiveness and employment within the sector.
Improving and developing the knowledge of professionals at the top is also needed; this includes the faculty doctoral schools and research institutions. This is why new, up-to-date research methods should be available to and used by a wider public, such as those used in the paper of Imre Fertő and Lajos Baráth on the economic effectiveness and competitiveness in foreign trade (Fertő - Baráth, 2014, p. 279-290).
Promotion of associations between small and medium businesses should be one of the important goals of agricultural policy.
The management of regional employment problems requires attention.
We believe that in the future the protection of the environment needs to be increasingly taken into consideration and enforced within agriculture. Such issues may include adaptation to climate change (global warming), which entails afforestation, establishment of shelter-belts, irrigation systems and targeted deployment of reservoirs etc. Such projects cannot come about without government (public) involvement and investment.

N2  - Wastewater irrigation is a widespread and growing phenomenon that carries varying degrees of risk. Whether spontaneously practiced in urban and periurban agriculture or planned as part of water reuse programmes, food and fodder production using untreated sewage or treated effluent can have serious human health implications for farmers and consumers, and can irreversibly degrade the environment. In low-income countries water pollution is often the result of inadequate wastewater collection and treatment, and unplanned release to receiving water bodies. Making wastewater irrigation safer depends on a location-specific combination of different pathogen barriers including, where possible, appropriate wastewater treatment. Ensuring that these strategies work in an integrated, mutually supportive manner requires a multi-sectoral paradigm shift in the common approach of wastewater management for disposal. Additionally, it is crucial to continue research (especially in developing countries) on the types and severity of risk, locally feasible mitigation options, the cost-effectiveness of safer wastewater irrigation practices compared to other interventions against diarrhoea and facilitating the adoption of ‘non-’ or ‘post-treatment’ options. This concluding chapter presents an outlook for wastewater irrigation by integrating the major findings of the present volume, synthesizing key elements of the current global status and challenges of sanitation and wastewater irrigation with emphasis on the WHO Guidelines. It also highlights wastewater-governance opportunities with the greatest potential to support safe wastewater irrigation that simultaneously address the combined challenges deriving from the global sanitation, water and food crises.

N2  - Investments in water infrastructure remain key to climate change adaptation plans in many countries, and rank high in adaptation costs for developing countries (Narain et al., 2011). In this paper, we use district-level panel data from 1970-2005 across India’s major agricultural states to investigate the role played by subsidized access to electricity, groundwater wells, tank and dam projects in mediating the vulnerabilities associated with monsoonal variation. We focus on wheat, a staple of India’s food supply, as it requires irrigation and represents a significant portion of India’s total agricultural output. Results show that the impact of negative precipitation shocks is significantly dampened when a particular district has access to a more reliable source of irrigation – e.g., access to tubewells helps to dampen the impact of negative precipitation shocks on irrigation decisions associated with wheat, while upstream dams do not significantly contribute to this dampening effect. In contrast, having access to dugwells exacerbates the impact of a fall in monsoon precipitation curtailing irrigation of wheat. Our results suggest that historical agricultural policies that increased access to tubewells and the subsequent electrification of regions naturally endowed with more groundwater have equipped farmers with the ability to withstand monsoonal shocks and fluctuations.

N2  - Irrigated agriculture has increased steadily in Syria over the last decades, almost doubling since 1985.
This mounting pace has responded to the nation’s food security policy objectives to satisfy the food
production needs of an increasing population that features one of the largest growth rates in the world,
namely 3,50 percent in 1985 and still 3,39 percent in 2007. Total expenditures for irrigated agriculture
accounted for almost 70 percent of all expenditures in agriculture. Sustainable irrigation water policies
aimed at increasing the efficiency of water use in agriculture and at conserving water resources by reducing
future consumption.
The Euphrates River is 2.800 km long and its middle traverses a wide floodplain in Syria, where it is used
extensively for irrigation, and the Euphrates Dam is 230 ft (70 m) high. The total estimated water use
volume is about 15 billion m3. The Euphrates and Orontes basins account for about 50% and 20% of the
water use respectively.
About 701.634 ha has been irrigated by ground water in the year 1997. This area represents 60% of the
total irrigated land in Syria It has been gradually increased from 30% during 1970 to 44% in 1980 and
49% in 1990.
The Government projects extended on 349.820 hectare area, which includes large, medium and small
scale farms. The small scale government project is under 2000 hectare, but large scale project over 20.000
hectare areas. The Syrian Government wants to ensure the food supply for sharply increasing population
based on established governmental agricultural projects, as state-owned farms.
Water balance for Syria indicates that most of the basins are in deficit. This will be exacerbated further
especially in basins encompassing large urban areas and if the country’s population continues to grow at
its current rate (about 3%) and water use efficiency is not increased effectively.

N2  - In Bangladesh, climatic change is likely to impact significantly upon surface and groundwater availability, as well as in other countries. The population of Bangladesh is projected to be double the current 2010 level by 2050. Demand for water will rise with the increasing demand for rice. This paper considers the optimal demand management of irrigation water with stochastic supply under climate change for a 3-year planning horizon. It also identifies the utilization of irrigation water from surface water sources to maximize the expected net social return from rice production. This is done by considering decision on dam release for rice production with reference to climate change. A stochastic dynamic programming model is developed for analyzing the levels and timing of the allocation of surface water for irrigation. The objective is to find the optimal dam release for irrigation which results in the maximum expected present value of the stream of annual net social return from rice production for the 3 years from 2012 to 2014. Net social return in a year consists of the value of rice consumed, measured by consumers’ willingness to pay for rice, less the total cost of rice production. The paper also identifies the need for irrigation infrastructure and determines the optimal investment policies for the adaptation to climate change in Bangladesh agriculture.

N2  - Inefficient performance of irrigation systems not only leads to a waste of water resources, but may also affect agriculture production, especially in regions facing a water stress problem. In rural China, only 40% of the water allocated to irrigation is effectively used, a figure much lower than many developed countries (Wang, 2000). Although traditional irrigation technology such as flood irrigation accounts for part of the inefficient use of water, the lack of effort in managing surface irrigation systems are also thought to affect the performance of China's water systems (Wang et al., 2003). 
In confronting problems with China's irrigation systems, leaders have begun experimenting with changing the institutions that manage water in rural communities. Since as early as the 1980s, but even more so since the late 1990s, China policy makers have promoted water management reform. In pursuing this policy, however, villages have responded differently. Some have chosen to stay with the traditional for of village leader-run irrigation management. In these villages, the village leader has been totally responsible for delivering water to farmers, collecting fees, and maintaining the system. They either manage the system themselves as part of their own duties or hire a manager for a fixed fee to perform water management tasks. In other villages, the leader has transferred all control and income rights of canals to private individuals, and the individual has effectively become the manager of a private water management company. Finally, in other villages, the village leader and the hired manager share responsibilities and share the profits from the irrigation tasks. 
While the importance of such reforms has been shown by others (Wang et al., 2003), no one has yet tried to explain why certain management forms have appeared in some villages and others in other villages. Observations in the field have provided hints, although there has yet been an attempt to formally model these. One thought is that while policy makers have encouraged reforms in general, they have left the details of designing the management forms to villagers and that villagers will choose a form of management that best fits the characteristics of their villages. It is possible that irrigation management in some villages requires a great deal of collective action while others require a great deal of careful management that could only be provided by individuals that spent considerable time and effort in orchestrating water deliveries and collecting fees from farmers. If village leaders are better at collective management, including tasks such as coordinating investment projects and mobilizing the village's labor to maintain canals, villages may decide to manage their canal system with a leader-run management system. Although leaders may not have much time or incentive to management water deliveries very carefully, if the main need of the system is the input of collective investment and collective labor (e.g., if the canal network silts up annually), leaders may still want to stay in complete control of the system. In contrast, if land is highly fragmented, households are spread out and cropping patterns are diverse and require careful timing, it may be that the best management strategy is to move to an individual contracting system, especially if the canal system requires little maintenance. Finally, if both maintenance and careful water allocation is needed, village leaders may share responsibilities with individual contractors in a share contracting system. Curiously, despite the importance of understanding contractual choice (both as a topic in itself and as part of the effort to measure the impact of water management reform), no work has been done on it. 
To address this topic, the overall goal of this paper is to provide a general framework for explaining the choice of canal managerial forms and to predict how the form of this contract will vary depending on characteristics of irrigation infrastructure, water resources and economic environment of different villages. To meet this overall goal, we have three specific objectives. Our first objective is to describe in detail the various managerial forms found in rural China: leader-run management system (or canals managed only by leaders who at most hire canal managers on a fixed-salary basis), share contracting system (or a form of managerial organization in which leaders and managers form a partnership), and individual contracting system, (or lease arrangements in which the manager manages canals alone after making a lump-sum, lease-type payment to the leader). Our second objective is to outline a theoretical framework explaining the leader's choice of the form of managerial organization (The word "outline" is used since the author's borrow heavily from Eswaren and Kotwal's (1985) model of contractual choice in tenancy contracting. The authors take credit, not for producing a new analytical framework, but rather for applying an existing theory in a convincing way to a very different question.). Finally, the predictive power of the model is tested by investigating how well data on the form of the contractual agreements struck between village leaders and canals managers can be explained by the factors suggested by the model. 
Our paper utilizes a unique set of data collected in Ningxia province in north China that we collected ourselves in 2001. Detailed interviews and formal surveys with village leaders, canal managers and workers helped the authors develop measures of the control and income rights enjoyed by those who manage the canals. We also collected additional data on other aspects of the form of the management contract, and on various measures of the nature of the village's irrigation infrastructure, characteristics of village leaders and canal managers, and variables that characterized the village economy. 
With these data, we first lay out the empirical facts. We show the correlations that exist between contractual choices and the characteristics of canal systems, the human capital characteristics of leaders and canal mangers and other economic factors. We build on these observations to build a theoretical model of contractual choice. Following the sharecropping literature (e.g., Eswaren and Kotwal, 1985), our model envisages village leader and canal manager as both contributing unmarketed resources in a managerial arrangement in which both agents have incentives to self-monitor. The optimal managerial form is ultimately determined by village leader, the guardian of the locality's assets, who calculates which form will return to him/her the highest level of profits. Our theoretical model helps us formulate several hypotheses that describe how villages might choose to organize village canal systems in different settings. 
In the final section of the paper, we test our theory econometrically. Taking advantage of the nature of the data to identify the determinants of contractual choices of village leaders in Ningxia province, we use multinomial regressions with fixed effects at county level to control for all variables that are unobservable at the county level and above. Our analysis shows that in villages with canals that require a lot of maintenance, village leader manage canals themselves. However, in villages in which the land is fragmented, leaders contract out irrigation services to individuals. Finally, when the leader is busy managing other activities in the village (e.g., a village-owned enterprise), leaders delegate responsibility for canal management to individuals. In general, our econometric results support the hypotheses generated by our model.

N2  - The continuous cultivation of the Rhodes Grass in Batinah costal area and Salalah region of Sultanate of Oman has a negative impact on the overall agriculture system and production. Improvement of the conditions could be achieved by introducing new water policy into farming and using Government suppor­ting tools to motivate farmers and achieve financial sustainability. The new water policy and strategies formed by Government are examined in three cultivated locations in this paper: Salalah location with enough irrigation water, Hanfeet location with low irrigation water and Dawkah location with very low irrigation water. Economic efficiency of the location is evaluated through the Net Present Value and IRR calculation. Within the assumption of the objective evaluation of input parameters, we can expect an acceptable economic efficiency of the investment only in Salalah location. The simplified deterministic evaluation of economic efficiency is formed to identify the relevant risk factors, followed by its quantification by the simulation processes. Taking the risk into account leads to a significant decrease of the economic attractiveness of stakeholders and more Government support is needed to achieve water policy and project sustainability at new location at Hanfeet and Dawkah location.

Hyderabad, India: International Water Management Institute (IWMI), South Asia Sub Regional Office
N2  - The objective of the study is to explore the scope for water productivity enhancement in irrigated agriculture
in India through: i] water control; ii] optimizing nutrient input to crop; iii] improving the quality and reliability of
irrigation water; and, iv] growing crops in regions where climate is favourable. The study is based on data from three
important river basins in India, viz., Indus, Narmada and Sabarmati. The study involved: 1] estimating the incremental
water productivity of selected crops viz., wheat and cotton in response to applied water, and fertilizer dosage; 2]
estimating water productivity of the same crop across agro-ecological zones within the basin, and 3] comparing
determinants of crop water productivity with different sources of irrigation with differential reliability and quality.
Most farmers are applying water within a regime where the yield response to both irrigation and fertilizer
dosage is positive. Also, their water application corresponds to a regime where water productivity (Rs./m3
) response
to irrigation is negative and fertilizer is positive. But, in certain situations, farmers’ water application regime
corresponds to a regime where both yield and water productivity responses to irrigation are either positive or
negative. Within basins, for the same crop, water productivity in both physical and economic terms is much higher in
high rainfall, sub-humid area as compared to that in low rainfall, arid areas. The quality and reliability of irrigation
can significantly impact the type of crops chosen by farmers and the crop yield, thereby raising water productivity.
There is ample scope for improving water productivity in irrigated agriculture through water control. But, in
most cases, it may lead to reduced net return per unit of land. Hence, they would have incentive to go for water control
measures only if there is sufficient land, which can be put to use for irrigated production using the saved water.

N1  - Presented at the 16th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, Shanghai, China
N2  - There is increasing interest in the water-food nexus, and the potential implications of future water scarcity for food production. However, little is known about the macro-economic implications of future water scarcity, and the potential impacts on global trade and economic welfare. In this paper, we utilize a recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, in order to study the global economic e_x001b_ects of projected water scarcity for 126 river basins, globally in the year 2030. Projected irrigation shortfalls are obtained from the IMPACT-WATER model, and these are imposed upon the present day economy. We _x001c_nd that regional production impacts are quite heterogeneous, depending on the size of the shortfall, the irrigation intensity of crop production, as well as the global commodity price e_x001b_ects. Projected 2030 scarcity leads to signi_x001c_cant output declines in China, South Asian, Middle East and North Africa, with increases in crop production sub-Sahara Africa. We _x001c_nd that projected irrigation shortfalls signi_x001c_cantly alter the geography of international trade. The global welfare loss amounts to $3.7 billion (2001 prices) both due to the reduction in irrigation availability, as well as due to interactions with domestic support for agriculture.

N2  - This article analyzes how irrigating farmers change their micro-level water allocation
in response to water supply variations under institutional water constraints and
project the irrigation percentage and farm income under future climate scenarios.
We use a highly-detailed data sample of irrigation status, water rights, water supply
and agricultural land use from Idaho’s Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer area.
Results indicate that 1-unit increase in irrigation percentage leads to ~US$18/ha
increase in crop revenue. Compared to crop revenue, micro-level irrigation
percentage is more prone to changes under long-term water stress. Seasonal water
supply variations only have limited impact on the productivity of the irrigated
agricultural sector as a whole. We postulate that average irrigation percentage and
farm income will, in effect, increase under Idaho’s institutional water governance in
the long run, when junior farmers stop irrigated agriculture practices due to
persistent water shortage.

Small reservoirs were meant at providing water for livestock, mitigating the impacts of recurrent drought, increasing food security, and reducing poverty. These small reservoirs are mostly located in Northern Ghana and have become an integral component of the communities they serve by supporting multiple livelihood strategies (livestock, fishing, irrigation and domestic use). In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, several donor-led development projects invested in rehabilitating and upgrading these small reservoirs through the inclusion of canal irrigation infrastructures. Most projects established water users associations (WUAs) that were aimed at ensuring sustainable management of the upgraded schemes. The underlying hypothesis was that local communities tend to have greater incentives than external actors to maintain their natural resources base. Organizing local farmers in a WUA would then increase their sense of ownership, leading to better performance of the system. Evidence from northern Ghana showed that WUAs have had mixed results. There is evidence of some WUAs having positive impacts. However, it is also clear that most WUAs fail to live up to expectation. This paper argues that the relative failure of WUAs is mostly due to the implementation approach that was adopted for their establishment during past development projects, specifically, the lack of attention given to the complex social fabric and the multiple actors and livelihood strategies that organized around small reservoirs. Past development projects re-iterated the model of “technology transfer” but, this time, by promoting an “institutional fix”. Government and donors should not only invest in infrastructure rehabilitation but also in soft components (organization, capacity, extension) that need to be embedded in the local social fabric.

N2  - Building on existing literature and the analysis of a portfolio of development projects (past and under implementation), this paper reviews the evolution of water user associations (WUAs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), reflecting on the conceptualization of how they operate, and the promised outcomes related to irrigation development, and the efficient and effective delivery of irrigation services. It also moves one step further from existing studies on WUAs, postulating that additional reflection is needed to understand the limitations of WUAs and proposes alternative, viable and context-based adapted models. This need is particularly strong in SSA where irrigation is incipient, and governments and donors are still consolidating their development approaches. Whereas a growing body of international literature takes into account the sociopolitical context of decentralized irrigation management, practical indication on what remains to be done to address the various limitations found in SSA stays meagre and scattered. The objective of this paper is not to challenge the myth of WUAs but to learn how to better deliver on the promised outcomes. The underlying message is that, if the SSA region is to be made water and food secure while respecting resource sustainability, community development, livelihoods and equality of resource access, the recurrent templates for WUA management and governance need to be revisited and adapted to local needs.

N2  - Inadequate access to safe water and sanitation services coupled with poor hygiene practices continues to kill, sicken and diminish opportunities of millions of people in developing countries.
Various interventions to improve drinking water quality and service levels, sanitation and hygiene (WSH) have been applied, albeit in isolated approaches. Relevant literature focused on assessing the cost and health effectiveness of such approaches. In parallel, irrigation in agriculture, which affects all the water cycle and thus drinking water quality and quantity, has been developed without looking into the consequences for WSH. In this paper, we argue that the ‘nexus’ approach should take
peoples’ multiple water needs as a starting point for providing integrated services and thus move beyond conventional sectoral barriers of domestic and productive sectors. Isolated approaches have their drawbacks missing out on positive externalities on health and nutrition outcomes. We also
argue that (the prospect of) a holistic approach including WSH and agriculture sectors for a long term health and nutrition impact should be explored. The paper reviews the body of literature dealing with WSH and irrigation agriculture, synthesizes the remarks thereof and concludes with suggestions to unravel the ‘nexus’ between WSH and agriculture for a long term health and nutrition impact.

N2  - Over exploitation of groundwater water resources is causing progressive decline in water table in the arid
and semi arid parts of India. The socio-economic impacts of these phenomena range from increased cost of well
irrigation to reduced returns from irrigated agriculture, to growing inequity in access to groundwater depending on
the aquifer conditions and the overall socio-economic conditions of the communities. In hard rock areas, over
exploitation is leading to decline in yield and drying up of open wells. This forces farmers to go for either well
deepening or drilling new bore wells. But due to the poor success in hitting water through bore well drilling in hard
rock areas and the consequent increase in costs of setting up a bore-well based irrigation scheme, small cultivators
are the worse affected. This paper focus on the phenomenon of well failure in the hard rock areas of Dewas in Madhya
Pradesh. It highlights the causes of well failure and related welfare impacts on the cultivators especially small
landowners. The major impacts were found to be on the cropping pattern, extent of well irrigation, crop yields, net
returns and food security in the surveyed region. In addition, discussion is centered on power subsidies in the state
which have promoted indiscriminate use and further depletion of groundwater from the already low yielding aquifers.

N2  - Policies of devolving management of resources from the state to user groups are premised upon the assumption that users will organize and take on the necessary management tasks. While experience has shown that in many places users do so and are very capable, expansion of co-management programs beyond initial pilot sites often shows that this does not happen everywhere. Yet, much is at stake in this, with more widespread adoption of irrigation management transfers and other forms of community-based resource management. It is therefore important to move beyond isolated case studies to comparative analysis of the conditions for collective action. 

This paper identifies factors affecting organization of water users associations, and collective action by farmers in major canal irrigation systems in India, based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of a stratified sample of 48 minors in four irrigation systems (two each in Rajasthan and Karnataka). Using key variables suggested by the theoretical and case study literature, the study first examines the conditions under which farmers are likely to form formal or informal associations at the level of the minor (serving several watercourses, and one or more villages). Results indicate that organizations are more likely to be formed in larger commands, closer to market towns, and in sites with religious centers and potential leadership from college graduates and influential persons, but head/tail location does not have a major effect. We then examine factors affecting two different forms of collective action related to irrigation systems: collective representation and maintenance of the minors. Lobbying activities are not more likely where there are organizations, but organizations do increase the likelihood of collective maintenance work.

N2  - Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50 percent, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6 percent of the total cultivated area. Eighty-five percent of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment needs in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. This type of analysis can guide country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

N2  - Pastoral livestock activities are highly extensive thereby resulting in pastoralists occupying large land areas and much of the land under pastoral control is less suitable for crop farming. Traditional pastoralism is often considered highly inefficient with respect to land-productivity. In an attempt to address these challenges, some countries have embarked on sedentarisation policies, aiming at nomadic households settling in one location or community. Sedentarisation is often aims at reducing the size of the land area under the control of pastoralists, thereby making land available for other economic activities such as crop production. Besides government intervention, pastoralists have also been known to willingly settle in or close to towns for numerous reasons such as higher political and economic security. Sedentarisation affects the entire economy via the production, income and expenditure patterns of the newly settled households as well as government. Hence the need to access the impact of the practice on the entire economy. This study uses a modified version of the STAGE 2 CGE model with some of the modifications including household mobility and differentiation between extensive (pastoral) and intensive livestock production. The study also uses Ethiopia as a case study where sedentarisation policies are being pursued. The results indicate that sedentarisation leads to an increase in pastoral wages and a reduction in pastoral livestock production due to the fall in factor supply. However, there are increases in intensive livestock and crop productions. Total cattle supply as well as the GDP of the economy reduces. Household groups also lose from this policy with a decline in income and welfare. The economy however benefits significantly when the sedentarisation policy is accompanied by irrigation agriculture. With such a supplementary policy all household groups except the pastoral household group experience increase in both income and welfare.

N2  - The knowledge today recaps that’s livelihood of many African farmers are constrained by poor access to both inputs and
output markets, limited entrepreneurial skills for adding value to produce and to bargain for better prices and finally limited
technical skills in agricultural production. Despite a tremendous attention to salvage this through government interventions
and research, there is still a big problem in addressing the smallholder farmer’s needs. Farmer organizations open up
opportunities for farmers to better overcome the above mentioned constraints through lobbying and collective action.
Drawing from results of Participatory diagnosis and participatory market research done in Nkhate irrigation scheme in 2007
and 2008 this paper examines the effect of effective farmer groups in influencing rice price formation. Results demonstrated
that farmer groups have the potential to effectively influence policy outcomes in their favour. This was however achieved
through reorganization and mobilization of farmer groups to improve lobbying efficiency and reduce the inefficiencies
caused by free riding. The results indicate that from the participatory gross margin analysis which was done by CIAT (
2007) with rice farmers at the irrigation scheme, it was revealed that farmers have been making losses in the marketing of
Kirombero and Super Fire rice varieties and have been realizing a very small positive margin for Mtupatupa a local rice
variety. The analysis revealed gross margins of 36.78 US$ ha-1, -182.50 US$ ha-1, and 60.36 US$ ha-1, for Super fire,
Kirombero and Mtupatupa varieties respectively. This shows that farmers were making losses when they sold rice to traders
at a price dictated to them. However, after farmers were effectively organised in a group and linked to markets, farmers
realized gross margins of 681.84US$ ha-1, 664.23US$ ha-1 and 1,028.69US$ ha-1 for Mtupatupa, Super fire and Kirombero
rice varieties respectively. The paper further recommends that such farmer groups need to better articulate and deliver
benefits to members hence ensuring that these members subscribe to the group and hence finance lobbying efforts which are
often costly.

N2  - This paper presents the empirical proof of the economic impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in a semi-arid agro-ecological district in Ghana. We employ the Trade-off Analysis Minimum Data (TOA-MD) Model simulated yield projections from five climate model scenarios HADCM, CGCM, CSIRO, NCAR and MIROC with farm survey data to estimate the economic impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in the Lawra district of Ghana with and without adaptation.. The findings reveal that smallholders in the district will suffer losses in net revenue, per capita income and increased poverty rates without adaptation. Adaptation will however, reverses the losses and results in potential gains with per farm net revenues and per capita incomes increasing between 10% to 17% and 1% to 7% respectively, while poverty rates decline by 13-20% for upland farms. Lowland farms are expected to experience a reduction in poverty of between 2-10%. Overall, adaptation has the potential of reducing poverty rates by as much as 8 -16% for all farms. The study recommends improving irrigation access to smallholder farmers in both upland and lowland areas to enable them adapt to water scarcity due to climate change. Key words: Climate change, small holder farmers, poverty reduction, TOA-model, Ghana

N2  - According to report produced by the Blacksmith institute (2013), Lead poisoning contributes 0.9 per cent of developing countries‟ disease burden. The main purpose of the study was to estimate the WTP for the improved water supply and sanitation services in Kabwe lead polluted areas in order to determine if the improved irrigation water supply project was viable. This was done using a contingent valuation method with a double bounded dichotomous choice question format. The study surveyed 485 randomly selected households using structured questionnaire face to face interview schedule in high lead endemic residential townships of Makululu, Chowa, Katondo and Kasanda. The sample included respondents aged 17-72 years old. Quantitative data was analysed using STATA computer software package. Analytical tools used included descriptive statistics and econometric Logit regression model. The results revealed that 75.05% of the rural smallholder farm households in the high lead affected areas were willing to pay for the improved irrigation water supply. Data sources originated from primary and secondary sources.
The study findings have shown that the majority of the sample households were affected by lead water pollution problems. Furthermore, results reveal that there is a positive WTP for improved irrigation water supply in Kabwe city. The response obtained from hypothetical market scenario indicates that households convey their WTP with a mean value of 50.072 Kwacha/household/month (US$7.58 /household/month) (US$1= K6.60) and the total WTP in the Kabwe city command areas is estimated to be 14,958,970 Kwacha/month (US$2,266,420.) for the whole population (300,000). Moreover, the study identified household income, age, education level; household size, gender, pollution control training, pollution experience, water source distance, first bid, and irrigated garden space are the main factors having a substantial effect on households' WTP of improved water supply. The study underlines that more attention should be given by government and other stakeholders for the implementation of irrigation water management practices in order to supply reliable irrigation water to the farmers. Furthermore, policy makers should develop and provide proper irrigation water pricing system, strengthen the existing soil and water conservation efforts and ensuring better soil and water conservation practices to manage the lead pollution problems in the catchment. Lastly, government and policy makers should consider the significant variables which have an impact in determining households' WTP.

N2  - Purpose. The purpose of the paper is to present the results of research on the assessing of the ecological-economic efficiency of the implementation of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water (on an example of the specific projects under soil-and-climatic conditions of Kharkiv and Donetsk regions). Methodology / approach. The research methodology is based on the use of an interdisciplinary approach. The study used the following methods: monographic (to generalize methodological and practical experience in the use of irrigation projects); laboratory-analytical (to determine the quality indicators of irrigation water); constructive-calculated (for calculating the indicators of economic efficiency of yield growth under irrigation conditions); Monte Carlo method (for simulation of crop yields without irrigation and under irrigation conditions); statistical (analysis of variance) (to assess the reliability of the results); generalizations (to summarize the intermediate and general results of ecological-economic analysis of experimental and model data). Results. As a result of laboratory analysis, water quality was assessed, which can be used for irrigation. The advantages of the project of organization of agricultural production under the conditions of drip irrigation are substantiated, and the investment attractiveness of this project was estimated. It is proved that the use of drip irrigation contributes not only to the economic effect, but also to adaptation to climate change. The economic efficiency of irrigation in agriculture, in particular, limited to suitable water (low quality) during the cultivation of various crops, was evaluated. Given the economic assessment, the cultivation of most crops under irrigated conditions with limited suitable water is ineffective. Originality / scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of the paper is that the provisions on ecological and economic efficiency of reclamation projects taking into account the quality of irrigation water has been further developed. This is one of the first paper devoted to the economic management of irrigation projects in Ukrainian agriculture in the context of climate change. Practical value / implications. The results of the study allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the implementation of drip irrigation projects, taking into account potential economic risks and expected benefits. The results of simulation modeling of crop yields under irrigation conditions can be used by agricultural enterprises to manage project risks.
