TI  - Can Integrated Agriculture-Nutrition Programs Change Gender Norms on Land and Asset Ownership? Evidence from Burkina Faso
PY  - 2013
AB  - There is a high degree of interest in the potential for agricultural programs to be designed and implemented to achieve health and nutrition objectives. Policymakers have often looked to the experience of civil society organizations in designing and implementing such programs, particularly in different social and cultural contexts. For the past 20 years, Helen Keller International (HKI) has implemented homestead food production programs in Asia and recently has started to adapt and implement these programs in Africa south of the Sahara. The goal of these programs is to improve the nutritional status of infants and young children through a number of production and nutrition interventions. These interventions are targeted to mothers under the presumption that increasing women’s access to and control over productive assets and enhancing women’s human capital to improve production and health and nutrition care practices will translate into improved nutritional status for their children. However, there is very little evidence documenting the ways in which HKI’s homestead food production programs influence women’s access to and control over productive assets and enhance women’s human capital in ways that may improve nutritional outcomes. This paper uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze the impact of HKI’s Enhanced-Homestead Food Production pilot program in Burkina Faso on women’s and men’s assets and on norms regarding ownership, use, and control of those assets. Even though men continue to own and control most land and specific assets in the study area, women’s control over and ownership of assets has started to change, both in terms of quantifiable changes as well as changes in people’s perceptions and opinions about who can own and control certain assets. The paper also discusses the implications of such changes for program sustainability.

TI  - The Cochrane Library - Interventions to improve water quality and supply, sanitation and hygiene practices, and their effects on the nutritional status of children
PY  - 2013
AB  - BACKGROUND: Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases, and may be linked to improved nutrition outcomes in children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 10 English-language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese-language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised (including cluster-randomised), quasi-randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross-sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study-level and individual-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies (five cluster-randomised controlled trials and nine non-randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low- and middle-income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight-for-height, weight-for-age or height-for-age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants.Weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age z-scores were available for five cluster-randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-age z-score (MD 0.05; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.12). Meta-analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-height z-score (MD 0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.11). Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height-for-age z-score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster-randomised controlled trials.No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster-randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low ( 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence from meta-analysis of data from cluster-randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9-12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low-income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.

TI  - Impact of treadle pump irrigation technology on smallholder poverty and food security in Malawi: a case study of Blantyre and Mchinji districts
PY  - 2008
AB  - The Malawi Government has intensified the use of treadle pump irrigation technology in an attempt to increase agricultural production and also to enrich the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers. As a result, the treadle pump is gaining in popularity among smallholder farmers throughout the country. This study was conducted in the districts of Blantyre in the Southern Region and Mchinji in the Central Region of Malawi. A total of 50 treadle pump and 50 non-treadle pump farmers were interviewed in each district to assess the impact of treadle pump irrigation technology with regard to food security and poverty. Gross margin analysis showed that adopters of the technology had higher net farm incomes per hectare (NFIs/ha) than non-adopters per year. In Blantyre, NFI/ha value for adopters was MK122,855 (US$1007) compared with MK15,987 (US$131) for non-adopters under irrigation conditions. Similar results were found in Mchinji with MK51,858 (US$425) and MK16,090 (US$132) for adopters and non-adopters, respective...

TI  - Gender aspects of small-scale private irrigation in Africa
PY  - NA
AB  - This Working Paper presents methodological and substantive findings of gender-differentiated quantitative farm household surveys about smallholders’ private irrigation technology adoption in Ghana and Zambia. Focusing on three gender variables, household headship, labor provision and plot management, the paper examines adoption rates, types of technologies and gendered labor provision in female- and male-headed households; compares adoption rates on women’s own plots with overall rates; compares women’s decision-making on irrigated plots and rainfed plots; and examines impacts of targeting strategies. Findings suggest that women are proactive irrigation adopters in spite of the many obstacles they face. Removing those obstacles serves both gender equality and irrigation policies.

TI  - DIETARY DIVERSITY AS A FOOD SECURITY INDICATOR
PY  - NA
AB  - Household food security is an important measure of well-being. Although it may not encapsulate all dimensions of poverty, the inability of households to obtain access to enough food for an active, healthy life is surely an important component of their poverty. Accordingly, devising an appropriate measure of food security outcomes is useful in order to identify the food insecure, assess the severity of their food shortfall, characterize the nature of their insecurity (for example, seasonal versus chronic), predict who is most at risk of future hunger, monitor changes in circumstances, and assess the impact of interventions. However, obtaining detailed data on food security status—such as 24- hour recall data on caloric intakes—can be time consuming and expensive and require a high level of technical skill both in data collection and analysis. This paper examines whether an alternative indicator, dietary diversity, defined as the number of unique foods consumed over a given period of time, provides information on household food security. It draws on data from 10 countries (India, the Philippines, Mozambique, Mexico, Bangladesh, Egypt, Mali, Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya) that encompass both poor and middle-income countries, rural and urban sectors, data collected in different seasons, and data on calories acquisition obtained using two different methods. ....[D]ietary diversity would appear to show promise as a means of measuring food security and monitoring changes and impact, particularly when resources available for such measurement are scarce.

TI  - A 2-Year Integrated Agriculture and Nutrition and Health Behavior Change Communication Program Targeted to Women in Burkina Faso Reduces Anemia, Wasting, and Diarrhea in Children 3–12.9 Months of Age at Baseline: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Among young children in Burkina Faso, anemia and chronic and acute undernutrition are widespread. Objective: This study assesses the impact of Helen Keller International’s (HKI) 2-y integrated agriculture [homestead food production (HFP)] and nutrition and health behavior change communication (BCC) program, targeted to women, on children’s (3–12.9 mo old at baseline) anthropometry (stunting, wasting, and underweight), mean hemoglobin (Hb), anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL), and diarrhea prevalence. Methods: We used a cluster-randomized controlled trial, with 55 villages randomly assigned to a control group (n = 25) or 1 of 2 treatment groups (n = 15 each), which differed by who delivered the BCC messages [older women leaders or health committee (HC) members]. We used difference-in-difference (DID) estimates to assess impacts on child outcomes. Results: We found marginally significant (P < 0.10) impacts on Hb (DID: 0.51 g/dL; P = 0.07) and wasting [DID: 28.8 percentage point (pp); P = 0.08] and statistically significant (P < 0.05) impacts on diarrhea (215.9 pp; P = 0.00) in HC compared with control villages among children aged 3–12.9 mo and larger impacts for anemia (DID: 214.6 pp; P = 0.03) and mean Hb (DID: 0.74 g/dL; P= 0.03) among younger children (aged 3–5.9 mo). However, we found no significant impacts on stunting or underweight prevalence. Plausibility was supported by greater improvements in womens agricultural production and maternal infant and young child feeding and care knowledge and practices in HC compared with control villages. Conclusions: HKIs 2-y integrated HFP+BCC program (HC group) significantly improved several child outcomes, including wasting (marginal), diarrhea, Hb, and anemia, especially among the youngest children. This is the first cluster-randomized controlled trial of an HFP program that documents statistically significant positive effects on these child nutrition outcomes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01825226. J Nutr doi: 10.3945/jn.114.203539.

TI  - A gender performance indicator for irrigation: concepts, tools and applications
PY  - 2002
AB  - Although gender issues are today a priority on the agendas of irrigation policy makers, interventionists, farm leaders and researchers, there is still a considerable gap between positive intentions and concrete action. An important but hitherto ignored reason for this is the lack of adequate generic concepts and tools that are policy-relevant and can accommodate the vast variation in irrigation contexts worldwide. The Gender Performance Indicator for Irrigation (GPII) aims to fill this gap. In any particular scheme, this tool diagnoses the gendered organization of farming and gender-based inclusion or exclusion in irrigation institutions. It informs irrigation agencies what they themselves can do for effective change-if necessary. The tool also identifies gender issues beyond a strict mandate of irrigation water provision. The Indicator was applied and tested in nine case studies in Africa and Asia. The research report presents the underlying concepts, methodological guidelines and selected applications of the GPII.

TI  - Effectiveness of agricultural interventions that aim to improve nutritional status of children: systematic review
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of agricultural interventions in improving the nutritional status of children in developing countries. Design Systematic review. Data sources Published and unpublished reports (after 1990) in English identified by searching 10 databases (Agris, Econlit, Eldis, IBSS, IDEAS, IFPRI, Jolis, PubMed, Web of Science, and World Bank), websites, previous systematic reviews, and reference lists and by contacting experts. Study selection Included studies assessed effects of agricultural interventions aiming at improving the nutritional status of children (bio-fortification, home gardens, small scale fisheries and aquaculture, dairy development, and animal husbandry and poultry development). Only studies that used a valid counterfactual analysis were included. Before/after studies and participants/non-participants comparisons affected by selection bias were excluded. Data analysis Results were analysed for four intermediate outcomes (programme participation, income, dietary diversity, and micronutrient intake) and one final outcome (prevalence of under-nutrition). Analysis was by summary tables of mean effects and by meta-analysis (for vitamin A absorption). Results The review included 23 studies, mostly evaluating home garden interventions. The studies reviewed did not report participation rates or the characteristics of participants in programmes. The interventions had a positive effect on the production of the agricultural goods promoted, but not on households’ total income. The interventions were successful in promoting the consumption of food rich in protein and micronutrients, but the effect on the overall diet of poor people remains unclear. No evidence was found of an effect on the absorption of iron, but some evidence exists of a positive effect on absorption of vitamin A. Very little evidence was found of a positive effect on the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children aged under 5. Conclusions The question posed by the review cannot be answered with any level of confidence. The data available show a poor effect of these interventions on nutritional status, but methodological weaknesses of the studies cast serious doubts on the validity of these results. More rigorous and better designed studies are needed, as well as the establishment of agreed quality standards to guide researchers in this important area.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on malaria in Africa: paddies paradox
PY  - 2001
AB  - The high population growth rate of the African continent has led to an increased demand for food and is in danger of outstripping agricultural production. In order to meet this need, many governments have sought ways of improving food production by initiating large-scale irrigation projects, involving reclamation of arid and semi-arid areas for the cultivation of crops. Although crop irrigation promises one solution to alleviating hunger and encourages economic growth, irrigation has often been blamed for aggravating disease in local communities. Malaria is one of the major tropical diseases associated with irrigation schemes, and changes in the transmission pattern of this disease following irrigation development have been a perennial subject of debate. It has often been assumed that high numbers of malaria vector Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) resulting from irrigation schemes lead inevitably to increased malaria in local communities. However, recent studies in Africa have revealed a more complex picture. Increased numbers of vectors following irrigation can lead to increased malaria in areas of unstable transmission, where people have little or no immunity to malaria parasites, such as the African highlands and desert fringes. But for most of sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is stable, the introduction of crop irrigation has little impact on malaria transmission. Indeed, there is growing evidence that for many sites there is less malaria in irrigated communities than surrounding areas. The explanation for this finding is still unresolved but, in some cases at least, can be attributed to displacement of the most endophilic and anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles funestus Giles by An. arabiensis Patton with lower vectorial capacity, as the latter thrives more than the former in ricefields. Similarly, among members of the An. gambiae complex, some cytotypes of An. gambiae sensu stricto are more vectorial than others. For example, the Mopti form has high vectorial capacity and breeds perennially in irrigated sites, whereas the savanna form is often sympatric but more seasonal. Also we suggest that many communities near irrigation schemes benefit from the greater wealth created by these schemes. Consequently irrigation communities often have greater use of bednets, better access to improved healthcare and receive fewer infective bites compared with those outside such development schemes. Thus, in most cases, irrigation schemes in Africa do not appear to increase malaria risk, except in areas of unstable transmission. However, developers should take the opportunity to improve health-care facilities for local communities when planning irrigation schemes wherever they occur.

TI  - A review of the effectiveness of agriculture interventions in improving nutrition outcomes
PY  - 2004
AB  - Objectives: To review the impact of agriculture interventions on nutritional status in participating households, and to analyse the characteristics of interventions that improved nutrition outcomes. Design: We identified and reviewed reports describing 30 agriculture interventions that measured impact on nutritional status. The interventions reviewed included home gardening, livestock, mixed garden and livestock, cash cropping, and irrigation. We examined the reports for the scientific quality of the research design and treatment of the data. We also assessed whether the projects invested in five types of ‘capital’ (physical, natural, financial, human and social) as defined in the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, a conceptual map of major factors that affect people’s livelihoods. Results: Most agriculture interventions increased food production, but did not necessarily improve nutrition or health within participating households. Nutrition was improved in 11 of 13 home gardening interventions, and in 11 of 17 other types of intervention. Of the 19 interventions that had a positive effect on nutrition, 14 of them invested in four or five types of capital in addition to the agriculture intervention. Of the nine interventions that had a negative or no effect on nutrition, only one invested in four or five types of capital. Conclusions: Those agriculture interventions that invested broadly in different types of capital were more likely to improve nutrition outcomes. Those projects which invested in human capital (especially nutrition education and consideration of gender issues), and other types of capital, had a greater likelihood of effecting positive nutritional change, but such investment is neither sufficient nor always necessary to effect change.

TI  - A literature review of the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change on women's and men's assets and well-being in developing countries
PY  - 2012
AB  - Climate change increasingly affects the livelihoods of people, and poor people experience especially negative impacts given their lack of capacity to prepare for and cope with the effects of a changing climate. Among poor people, women and men may experience these impacts differently. This review presents and tests two hypotheses on the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change on women and men in developing countries. The first hypothesis is that climate-related events affect men’s and women’s well-being and assets differently. The second hypothesis is that climate-related shocks affect women more negatively than men. With limited evidence from developing countries, this review shows that climate change affects women’s and men’s assets and well-being differently in six impact areas: (i) impacts related to agricultural production, (ii) food security, (iii) health, (iv) water and energy resources, (v) climate-induced migration and conflict, and (vi) climaterelated natural disasters. In the literature reviewed, women seem to suffer more negative impacts of climate change in terms of their assets and well-being because of social and cultural norms regarding gender roles and their lack of access to and control of assets, although there are some exceptions. Empirical evidence in this area is limited, patchy, varied, and highly contextual in nature, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions. Findings here are indicative of the complexities in the field of gender and climate change, and signal that multidisciplinary research is needed to further enhance the knowledge base on the differential climate impacts on women’s and men’s assets and well-being in agricultural and rural settings, and to understand what mechanisms work best to help women and men in poor communities become more climate resilient.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation Dams, Agricultural Production, and Health: Theory and Evidence from Ethiopia - Small-scale irrigation dams, agricultural production, and health - theory and evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2005
AB  - The author looks at the feasibility and potential of instituting small-scale irrigation dams to reduce Ethiopias dependence on rainfed agriculture and the associated food insecurity. He develops a theoretical framework to assess the welfare implications of irrigation development programs and provides empirical evidence from microdam construction and reforestation projects in northern Ethiopia. The author pays particular attention to health-related costs of establishing small-scale irrigation dams in areas prone to waterborne diseases. While the theoretical analyses imply that the net welfare impacts of irrigation dams cannot be known a priori due to potential health costs, the empirical evidence shows that current agricultural yield and farm profit have increased in villages with closer proximity to the dams than in those more distant. The increased disease incidence due to standing pools of water has, however, led to significant declines in the returns from investment in irrigation water. Households with poor health are less likely to adopt productivity-enhancing as well as resource-conserving technologies, which are crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable agricultural development. The ensuing sickness has also led to reduction in labor allocation to off-farm activities. The findings underline the importance of weighing beforehand the magnitude of potential economic benefits against health costs of water development programs. The overall evidence, however, suggests that carefully designed irrigation dams could significantly improve agricultural production and food security, particularly in areas where waterborne diseases pose negligible risk to health or can be cost-effectively controlled.

TI  - Malaria and Agriculture: A Global Review of the Literature with a Focus on the Application of Integrated Pest and Vector Management in East Africa and Uganda
PY  - 2012
AB  - Malaria is one of the top five causes of death worldwide, and roughly half the world’s population lives at risk of the disease. This health problem disproportionately affects the poor, particularly those in Africa south of the Sahara, where the disease is widespread. Many of those most afflicted are part of farming households; therefore agriculture, poverty, and health are intimately linked through malaria. Uganda has the highest malaria parasite transmission in the world and is an important case study due to the role agricultural development has played in increasing malaria transmission within the country, according to the literature reviewed here.This review brings together current research from agricultural economics, environmental science, and epidemiology to provide a foundation for research directly addressing how malaria relates these fields to one another in malaria-endemic settings such as the East African highlands. While each field has addressed malaria within existing academic frameworks, this literature review should support further interdisciplinary research by providing a detailed and well-documented account of integrative work on malaria to date.More than 280 published articles and reports were included in the final review, and many more were included in the selection process. Due to the massive volume of literature published on malaria, the selection has been limited to those articles found to fill particular gaps in interdisciplinary understanding.Ambiguities on the causal relationships between malaria and poverty, climate change, irrigation, and land use changes are discussed in the light of high local variation in impact on malaria transmission. Integrated pest management is explored due to its utilization of farmers’ vocational skills and success in reversing the pesticide resistance now threatening malaria interventions worldwide. In particular, integrated pest and vector management (IPVM) interventions are assessed as a potential option to reduce the malaria burden in agricultural communities. Farmer field schools and IPVM may provide a cost-effective and integrated solution for improving both health and poverty outcomes. Such programs can foster collaboration between the health and agricultural sectors, and draw on the expertise of each in contributing to rural development in malaria-endemic areas.

TI  - Nutritional Importance of Animal Source Foods
PY  - 2003
AB  - Animal source foods can provide a variety of micronutrients that are difficult to obtain in adequate quantities from plant source foods alone. In the 1980s, the Nutrition Collaborative Research Support Program identified six micronutrients that were particularly low in the primarily vegetarian diets of schoolchildren in rural Egypt, Kenya and Mexico: vitamin A, vitamin B-12, riboflavin, calcium, iron and zinc. Negative health outcomes associated with inadequate intake of these nutrients include anemia, poor growth, rickets, impaired cognitive performance, blindness, neuromuscular deficits and eventually, death. Animal source foods are particularly rich sources of all six of these nutrients, and relatively small amounts of these foods, added to a vegetarian diet, can substantially increase nutrient adequacy. Snacks designed for Kenyan schoolchildren provided more nutrients when animal and plant foods were combined. A snack that provided only 20% of a child's energy requirement could provide 38% of the calcium, 83% of the vitamin B-12 and 82% of the riboflavin requirements if milk was included. A similar snack that included ground beef rather than milk provided 86% of the zinc and 106% of the vitamin B-12 requirements, as well as 26% of the iron requirement. Food guides usually recommend several daily servings from animal source food groups (dairy products and meat or meat alternatives). An index that estimates nutrient adequacy based on adherence to such food guide recommendations may provide a useful method of quickly evaluating dietary quality in both developing and developed countries.

TI  - Women&#8217;s Empowerment in Agriculture, Production Diversity, and Nutrition. Evidence from Nepal
PY  - 2013
AB  - With the increasing recognition that agricultural growth and development do not necessarily translate into improved nutrition outcomes, policymakers are increasingly grappling with how to design and implement agricultural policies and programs that can also achieve nutritional objectives. Agriculture has direct links to nutrition in that it provides a source of food and nutrients and a broad-based source of income, as well as directly influencing food prices. Gender roles mediate these linkages, particularly in relation to increased food availability and increased income. Thus, one possible pathway through which agricultural development could improve health and nutrition outcomes is by considering gender roles and gender equity in agriculture. Using household survey data from Nepal, we investigate the impact of women’s empowerment in agriculture and production diversity on dietary diversity and anthropometric outcomes of mothers and children. Production diversity is positively associated with mothers’ dietary diversity and body mass index. Production diversity is positively associated with dietary diversity for children under two and predicts weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ), and height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores of children over two years of age. Indicators of empowerment are significantly associated with maternal outcomes but have a variable effect on child outcomes. Women’s autonomy in production and hours worked improve maternal and children’s dietary diversity and child HAZ.

TI  - Can market-based approaches to technology development and dissemination benefit women smallholder farmers? A qualitative assessment of gender dynamics in the ownership, purchase, and use of irrigation pumps in Kenya and Tanzania
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rural household economies dependent on rainfed agriculture are increasingly turning to irrigation technology solutions to reduce the effects of weather variability and guard against inconsistent and low crop output. Organizations are increasingly using market-based approaches to disseminate technologies to smallholder farmers, and, although women are among their targeted group, little is known of the extent to which these approaches are reaching and benefiting women. There is also little evidence on the implications of women’s use and control of irrigation technologies for outcomes, including crop choice and income management. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study undertaken in Tanzania and Kenya to examine women’s access to and ownership of KickStart pumps and the implications for their ability to make major decisions on crop choices and use of income from irrigated crops. Results from sales-monitoring data show that women purchase less than 10 percent of the pumps and men continue to make most of the major decisions on crop choices and income use. These findings vary by type of crop, with men making major decisions on high-income crops such as tomatoes and women having relatively more autonomy on crops such as leafy vegetables. The study concludes that market-based approaches on their own cannot guarantee access to and ownership of technologies, and businesses need to take specific measures toward the goal of reaching and benefiting women.

TI  - Got milk? The impact of Heifer International's livestock donation programs in Rwanda on nutritional outcomes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract International animal donation programs have become an increasingly popular way for people living in developed countries to transfer resources to families living in developing countries. We evaluate the impact of Heifer International’s dairy cow and meat goat donation programs in Rwanda. We find that the program substantially increases dairy and meat consumption among Rwandan households who were given a dairy cow or a meat goat, respectively. We also find marginally statistically significant increases in weight-for-height z -scores and weight-for-age z -scores of about 0.4 standard deviations among children aged 0–5 years in households that were recipients of meat goats, and increases in height-for-age z -scores of about 0.5 standard deviations among children in households that received dairy cows. Our results suggest that increasing livestock ownership in developing countries may significantly increase consumption of nutrient dense animal-source foods and improve nutrition outcomes.

TI  - Assessment of a Smallscale Irrigation Scheme on Household Food Security and Leisure in Kokoligu; Ghana
PY  - 2013
AB  - The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of a small scale irrigation scheme on household food security and leisure time of the people in Kokoligu - a subsistence-based farming community in the Nandom District of Ghana. A total of fifty household heads adequately represented Kokoligu as homogenous community via simple random sampling technique. In-depth interview (IDI) schedules and observation guides were used to source information on food security situations before and after introducing the irrigation scheme and the effects of the scheme on residents’ leisure during the off farming season. The study revealed that the irrigation scheme enhanced household food security and wellbeing during the off farming (dry) season but significantly reduced leisure; communal intimacy in addition to degrading the cultural heritage in the study area. Majority of the farmers (83%) irrigated vegetables, for household consumption and sale to complement the significant proportion of staple food crops (maize, millet and rice) cultivated during farming season to salvage their nutritional needs. With regard to the fading cultural heritage and communal intimacy, the paper recommended that cultural reawakening should be pursued through both formal education in schools and informal education by initiatives of the community elders and the traditional council.

TI  - The impact of smallholder irrigation on household welfare: The case of Tugela Ferry irrigation scheme in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - The potential of smallholder irrigated agriculture to enhance food security and alleviate rural poverty has led the South African Government to prioritise and invest significantly in irrigation establishment, rehabilitation and revitalisation. The question addressed in this study pertains to the extent to which smallholder irrigation has been able to reduce poverty in the rural communities to justify this investment. Using a sample of 251 farmers, this study found that factors such as land size, perceived soil fertility, household size, and access to support services were significant predictors of irrigation participation. The results from the treatment effect model indicated that access to irrigation plays a positive role in the welfare of rural households, with irrigators spending about ZAR2 000 per adult equivalent on consumption more than the non-irrigators. The study, therefore, concluded that government investments in smallholder irrigation for poverty reduction are justified. The other factors that influenced household consumption were off-farm income, land size, livestock size, education level, family size and access to support services and infrastructure. The study recommends that investments in smallholder irrigation continue for poverty reduction, and that priority should also be on finding other feasible rural micro-projects and development initiatives to complement smallholder irrigation and significantly reduce rural poverty.

TI  - THE ROLE OF IRRIGATION ON IMPROVEMENT OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF YOUNG CHILDREN IN CENTRAL KENYA
PY  - 2007
AB  - A comparative, retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the role of irrigation on improvement of nutritional status of children aged 6 – 59 months in a semi-arid setting. Two equal samples of fifty-nine children (aged 6 – 59 months) hereafter, referred to as the Project and the Non-project groups, respectively were randomly selected from households with and without access to irrigation water in Kieni East Division of Nyeri District, Kenya. The study area is situated in the drier western leeward side of Mt. Kenya and is characteristic by unreliable rainfall of between 500 to 1200 mm per annum. Weight, height and age of index children were determined and the corresponding standard deviations of weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age calculated and compared to the reference standards developed by the US National Centre for Health Statistics. Energy and nutrient intake was determined using 24-hour dietary recall method. The findings on socio-demographic characteristics showed that the Project and Non-project households were similar in terms of household size, land size, marital status of the respondent, maternal and paternal education and occupation. The calorie intake of over two-fifth (42%) of the children from the Non-project households compared to 39% from the Project households was below the Recommended Daily Allowance. The children from commercial farming Project households had significantly higher weight-for-age Z-score than those from commercial farming Non-project households. Similarly, children from high-income Project households had significantly higher height-for-age Z-score than those from high-income Non-project households. The prevalence of stunting was also significantly lower in the high-income Project households compared to high-income Non-project households. Among the male children, the prevalence of underweight was significantly higher in Non-project households than in Project households. Overall, the prevalence of stunting and underweight which are indicators of long-term nutritional deprivation were higher in Non-project households than Project households. The findings of the study led to the conclusion that irrigation contributes to increased per capita food availability resulting in higher energy intakes and subsequently enables households to safeguard young children against chronic malnutrition. Also, poverty as characterised by low household income remains a main determinant of nutritional status. Keywords : stunting; wasting; underweight; irrigation

TI  - Agricultural development and nutrition among rural populations: A case study of the middle valley in Senegal
PY  - 1993
AB  - Food production in Sahelian countries is very dependent on erratic rainfall. To eliminate this climatic risk, modern irrigated agriculture was introduced and spread into the Senegal Valley in the course of the last thirty years. In such a context of changes in farming systems and food consumption patterns, a nutritional and dietary study was conducted three different times at six month intervals among 37 families of a village community which farmed a recently established irrigated area. Women played an important part in agricultural tasks. Average food consumption met the recommended intake for energy but deficiencies persist for certain nutrients. The prevalence of malnutrition was high, with 16% stunting and 13% wasting among children between the ages of 0 and 10 years; a third of the older children and 20% of the adults presented an emaciated appearance. Rice production has increased food security but, in comparison with the situation in the valley 35 years ago, nutritional gains were slight and there ...

TI  - Solar-powered drip irrigation enhances food security in the Sudano-Sahel.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population over the next half-century will require technologies that significantly improve rural livelihoods at minimal environmental cost. These technologies will likely be distinct from those of the Green Revolution, which had relatively little impact in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, few such interventions have been rigorously evaluated. This paper analyzes solar-powered drip irrigation as a strategy for enhancing food security in the rural Sudano–Sahel region of West Africa. Using a matched-pair comparison of villages in northern Benin (two treatment villages, two comparison villages), and household survey and field-level data through the first year of harvest in those villages, we find that solar-powered drip irrigation significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season, and is cost effective compared to alternative technologies.

TI  - Food Security and Nutrition in Bangladesh: Progress and Determinants
PY  - NA
AB  - For Bangladesh food security was synonymous with achieving self-sufficiency in rice production and stabilization in rice prices. The country has made good progress in increasing rice production through technological progress, facilitated by private sector investment in small scale irrigation. But, it is difficult to sustain the progress made in view of the growing pressure of population on scarce land resources. Domestic food grain production remains susceptible to floods and droughts thereby perpetuating the threat of major production shortfalls, inadequate food availability, and vulnerability from fluctuation in prices. The availability of other foods has not increased, and the progress in nutritional outcome has remained slow. Forty percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and income inequality has been worsening. This paper assesses the trends in factors that affect food production, availability of food and their impact on nutrition outcomes. It also probes into the trends in poverty and distribution of income and access to food through markets.

TI  - Access to irrigation and the escape from poverty: Evidence from Northern Mali
PY  - 2008
AB  - "Significant changes in the agricultural sector in northern Mali suggest that irrigation has made a large contribution to welfare increases over the past eight years. Using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and matched difference in differences with a small panel, this study estimates the impact of access to irrigation on poverty, production, and nutrient intakes. The findings suggest that gains in agricultural production value do not transfer uniquely to household consumption. The paper tests two alternative hypotheses about the distribution of agricultural gains: (1) the gains in agricultural production induced by irrigation yield higher household savings, or (2) intra-village transfers from irrigators to non-irrigators contribute to informal social insurance. The paper provides evidence of both saving and sharing within villages as complimentary strategies for consuming gains in agricultural production. This finding suggests that estimating the effects of a program, relying solely on household consumption, may underestimate the welfare gains of irrigation investment by ignoring the household's savings and informal insurance network." from Author's Abstract

TI  - Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture: What Role for Food Security in Bangladesh?
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary Using a nationally representative survey from Bangladesh, we examine the relationship between women’s empowerment in agriculture, measured using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index, and per capita calorie availability, dietary diversity, and adult body mass index (BMI). Accounting for potential endogeneity of empowerment, we find that increases in women’s empowerment are positively associated with calorie availability and dietary diversity at the household level. Overall, household wealth, education, and occupation are more important than women’s empowerment as determinants of adult nutritional status, although negative impacts of group membership and credit on male BMI suggest that intrahousehold trade-offs may exist.

TI  - EFFECT OF IRRIGATION AND LARGE DAMS ON THE BURDEN OF MALARIA ON A GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SCALE
PY  - 2005
AB  - Human-made ecologic transformations have occurred at an unprecedented rate over the past 50 years. Prominent among them are water resource development projects. An estimated 40,000 large dams and 800,000 small dams have been built, and 272 million hectares of land are currently under irrigation worldwide. The establishment and operation of water projects has had a history of facilitating a change in the frequency and transmission dynamics of malaria, but analyses of these environmental risk factors are sparse. Here, we present a comprehensive review of studies that assessed the impact of irrigation and dam building on malaria prevalence or incidence, stratified by the World Health Organization's (WHO) sub-regions of the world, and link these studies with the latest statistics on disability adjusted life years, irrigated agriculture, and large dams. We also present estimates of the population at risk due to proximity to irrigation schemes and large dam reservoirs. In WHO sub-regions 1 and 2, which have 87.9% of the current global malaria burden, only 9.4 million people are estimated to live near large dams and irrigation schemes. In contrast, the remaining sub-regions concentrate an estimated 15.3 million people near large dams and up to 845 million near irrigation sites, while here only 12.1% of the global malaria burden is concentrated. Whether an individual water project triggers an increase in malaria transmission depends on the contextual determinants of malaria, including the epidemiologic setting, socioeconomic factors, vector management, and health seeking behavior. We conclude that in unstable malaria endemic areas, integrated malaria control measures, coupled with sound water management, are mandatory to mitigate the current burden of malaria in locations near irrigation or dam sites.

TI  - Availability of irrigation water for domestic use in Pakistan: its impact on prevalence of diarrhoea and nutritional status of children.
PY  - 2002
AB  - This study assessed whether availability of water for domestic use had any impact on nutritional status of children in an area where people depend on irrigation water for all their domestic water needs. During May 1998-April 1999, data on the occurrence of diarrhoea among 167 children aged less than five years were collected from 10 villages in the command area of the Hakra 6R canal in southern Punjab, Pakistan. Anthropometric measurements were taken at the end of the study period. Additional surveys were conducted to collect information on the availability of water, sanitary facilities, hygiene, and socioeconomic status. Height-for-age and longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea were used as outcome measures. Quantity of water available in households was a strong predictor of height-for-age and prevalence of diarrhoea. Children from households with a large storage capacity for water in the house had a much lower prevalence of diarrhoea and stunting than children from families without this facility. Having a toilet was protective for diarrhoea and stunting. Increased quantity of water for domestic use and provision of toilet facilities were the most important interventions to reduce burden of diarrhoea and malnutrition in this area. An integrated approach to water management is needed in irrigation schemes, so that supply of domestic water is given priority when allocating water in time and space within the systems.

TI  - Effect Of Small-Scale Irrigation On The Income Of Rural Farm Households: The Case Of Laelay Maichew District, Central Tigray, Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - Agricultural intensification is presumed to be a necessary pre-condition for the development of the agricultural sector in Ethiopia. To this end, various government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), among others, initiated small-scale irrigation schemes throughout the country including the Tigray region. Despite these efforts, however, smallholder farmers particularly in the study area are found to be reluctant to participate in small-scale irrigation schemes. This study therefore, assessed the factors that affect smallholder farmers’ participation in small-scale irrigation of the study area. It also explored the effect of participation in small-scale irrigation on the income of rural farm households. A two-stage sampling procedure was used to first select peasant associations and then sample respondents. Descriptive statistics and Heckman’s two-stage estimation were used to estimate determinants of small-scale irrigation participation and household income. The analysis revealed that income, gender, access to market information and health condition of households are important determinants for participating in small scale irrigation schemes. The analysis further revealed that irrigation participation, family labor force, livestock ownership and access to market information and credit are positively and significantly associated with household income. Hence, improving rural farm households’ access to market information and health services, is likely to improve participation in irrigation schemes thereby improve small holder farmers income.

TI  - The case for distributed irrigation as a development priority in sub-Saharan Africa.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Distributed irrigation systems are those in which the water access (via pump or human power), distribution (via furrow, watering can, sprinkler, drip lines, etc.), and use all occur at or near the same location. Distributed systems are typically privately owned and managed by individuals or groups, in contrast to centralized irrigation systems, which tend to be publicly operated and involve large water extractions and distribution over significant distances for use by scores of farmers. Here we draw on a growing body of evidence on smallholder farmers, distributed irrigation systems, and land and water resource availability across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to show how investments in distributed smallholder irrigation technologies might be used to (i) use the water sources of SSA more productively, (ii) improve nutritional outcomes and rural development throughout SSA, and (iii) narrow the income disparities that permit widespread hunger to persist despite aggregate economic advancement.

TI  - What is the irrigation potential for Africa? A Combined Biophysical and Socioeconomic Approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50%, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF SMALL SCALE IRRIGATION SCHEMES ON RURAL LIVELIHOODS: THE CASE OF PANGANAI IRRIGATION SCHEME BIKITA DISTRICT ZIMBABWE.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Although the establishment of Panganai small scale irrigation was in an endeavour to improve the welfare of the people it remains a pressing issue as economic and social problems continue to affect plot holders which results in the scheme being undermined. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of small scale irrigation scheme on the people’s livelihoods in Panganai Communal area. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used in the investigation of the impact of the scheme on rural livelihoods. A sample of fifty respondents out of a total of two hundred plot holders was selected using random sampling. Data was collected using interviews, questionnaires and observation. Analyses were done using descriptive statistics. Tables and graphs were employed in presentation and analysis. Results were that the irrigation scheme has managed to create employment, income generation, supply water throughout the year, acquisition of assets such as scotch carts and livestock by farmers and school fees generation by the community as a whole. However the yields produced have not yet addressed the food security situation of plot holders. This is attributed to prohibitive water pricing and transport costs which negatively affected their desire to produce at maximum capacity. However the intervention by interested stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations and Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) as well as economic recovery programmes like such as farm mechanization are recommended to ensure the viability and sustainability of irrigation on rural livelihoods.

TI  - Can Smallholder Fruit and Vegetable Production Systems Improve Household Food Security and Nutritional Status of Women? Evidence from Rural Uganda
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper aims to empirically infer potential causal linkages between fruit and vegetable (F&V) production, individual F&V intake, household food security, and anemia levels for individual women caregivers of childbearing age. Using a unique and rich dataset recently collected from rural smallholder Ugandan households, we show that the use of a qualitative tool to measure household food insecurity is robust and applicable in other contexts. We also show, using robust econometric methods, that women living in F&V-producer households have a significantly higher intake of F&Vs than those living in nonproducer households. Furthermore, F&V-producer households are potentially more food secure, and women caregivers in producer households have significantly higher levels of hemoglobin, rendering the prevalence rates of anemia lower among F&V-producer households. We argue that these effects, modest as they are, could be further improved if there were deliberate efforts to promote the intensification of smallholder F&V production.

TI  - The problems associated with pesticide use by irrigation workers in Ghana
PY  - 1997
AB  - The use of pesticides in Ghanaian agriculture, though beneficial in reducing crop loss both before and after harvest, has been associated with threats to human health often due to the misapplication of the chemicals. This study was an initial attempt to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices of 123 farm workers on three irrigation project areas in the Accra Plains, Ghana, regarding the safe handling and use of pesticides, to assess the prevalence of symptoms associated with organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and carbamates and to determine the prevalence of pesticide-related symptoms, and blood cholinesterase. The study design was cross-sectional in type. Methods used were interviews and observation, and biological monitoring. The results revealed moderate levels of knowledge of the routes of absorption of pesticides and of potential symptoms following exposure. Knowledge of personal protective measures was poor to moderate. High risk practices included frequent handling of the chemicals, home storage of pesticides and short re-entry intervals. Despite knowledge of some health risks associated with pesticides, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was minimal due primarily to financial constraints. The prevalence of symptoms was higher and cholinesterase levels lower than in a control group of teachers. It is suggested that there is a need for more epidemiologic studies to investigate the problems associated with pesticide induced ill health as well as research into appropriate and affordable PPE. PPE needs to be subsidized. Training of agriculture and health workers in safety precautions, recognition, and management of pesticide-related ill health is a matter of urgency.

TI  - The Effects of Household Food Production Strategies on the Health and Nutrition Outcomes of Women and Young Children: A Systematic Review
PY  - 2012
AB  - The objective of this review is to systematically examine and summarise the effects of agricultural interventions to increase household food production on the nutrition and health outcomes of women and young children and provide recommendations for future research and programming. Data from all studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria were abstracted into a standardised form. The quality of the evidence was assessed and graded using a modified version of the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation technique. Thirty-six articles, representing 27 unique projects were identified. Of these 32 and 17 reported on the health and nutrition outcomes of children and women, respectively. Although studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analysis, agricultural strategies consistently reported significantly improved diet patterns and vitamin A intakes for both women and children. Although some individual studies reported significant reductions in child malnutrition, summary estimates for effects on stunting [relative risk (RR) 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84, 1.04]], underweight (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.60, 1.07]) and wasting (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.60, 1.38]) were not significant. Findings for an effect on vitamin A status, anaemia and morbidity were inconsistent. Overall the evidence base for the potential of agricultural strategies to improve the nutrition and health of women and young children is largely grounded in a limited number of highly heterogeneous, quasi-experimental studies, most of which have significant methodological limitations. While household food production strategies hold promise for improving the nutrition of women and children, the evidence base would be strengthened by additional research that is methodologically robust and adequately powered for biological and dietary indicators of nutrition.

TI  - The effects of irrigation on poverty: a framework for analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

TI  - The Impact of Irrigation on the Nutritional Status of Children in the Sissala West District of Ghana
PY  - 2012
AB  - According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2006) the most sustainable way to reduce hunger effectively is to improve agriculture and rural development simultaneously. The study investigated the impact of irrigation dam projects on child nutritional status. A total of 397 mother-child pair from three communities (control, 1 year and 2 year intervention with introduction of irrigation dam) with and without irrigation dams participated in the study. Nutritional status was assessed using anthropometric indicators (height/length, weight and MUAC) and haemoglobin levels. For haemoglobin assessment a sub-sample of 200 children was used. Twenty-four h dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake. The results showed significant differences (p<0.001) in wasting rates of 11.0, 21.2 and 12.3%, respectively, among children in the control, 1 year intervention and 2-year intervention communities, respectively. Haemoglobin assessment revealed that a greater proportion of children (70.1%) were anaemic. The 1 year intervention had a significantly higher number of children (p<0.001) who had haemoglobin in the normal range. Most (95.9%) of the children did not meet their energy needs according to their dietary intake records. Child feeding practices continue to be a challenge in these communities. Currently, the impact of the irrigation dam on the livelihoods and nutritional status of the children is not obvious but more time is needed to realize the full potential. Nutrition education should target the incorporation of fish from the dam into young child feeding in these communities.

TI  - Climbing the Water Ladder : Multiple-Use Water Services For Poverty Reduction
PY  - NA
AB  - In low- and middle-income countries, people need water for drinking, personal hygiene and other domestic use. But they also use it for livestock, horticulture, irrigation, fisheries, brickmaking, and other small-scale enterprises. Multiple-use water services (MUS) are best suited to meeting people’s needs. However, most water services are designed only for domestic water or only for agriculture, and fail to reflect its real-life use. The action research project ‘Models for implementing multiple-use water supply systems for enhanced land and water productivity, rural livelihoods and gender equity’ developed case studies in eight countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, Thailand and Zimbabwe) involving 150 institutions. The project analysed two models: homestead-scale and community-scale MUS and developed a ‘multiple-use water ladder' to show how better livelihoods flow from increased access to water. This book shows how livelihoods act as the main driver for water services and how access to water is determined by sustainable water resources, appropriate technologies and equitable ways of managing communal systems. Climbing the water ladder requires a small fraction of total water resources, yet has the potential to help people climb out of poverty. Local government can be the pivot to make this happen. But, it needs support to implement its mandate to meet multiple-use demand and to become more accountable to people in communities.

TI  - Gender: A Key dimension LinKinG AGricuLturAL ProGrAms to imProved nutrition And HeALtH
PY  - 2012
AB  - Improving the livelihoods and well-being of the rural poor is an important aim of agricultural development, promoted through agricultural intensification and commercialization strategies. But improved agricultural productivity does not necessarily translate into improved health and nutrition, either for producers or consumers. How can standard agricultural development strategies—promoting agricultural intensification, greater linkages to markets, and high-value production—also create positive impacts on health and nutrition? This brief argues that a key element linking these programs to improved outcomes is the dimension of gender roles and gender equity. A large body of evidence shows that, in many parts of the world, men and women spend money differently: women are more likely to spend the income they control on food, healthcare, and education of their children. Increasing household income does not necessarily improve the nutritional and health status of women and children when that income is controlled by men. Women’s relative bargaining power within the household is likely to influence whether gains in income translate into nutritional improvements. Empirical evidence shows that increasing women’s control over land, physical assets, and financial assets serves to raise agricultural productivity, improve child health and nutrition, and increase expenditures on education, contributing to overall poverty reduction. Arimond and colleagues have identified five pathways through which agricultural interventions can affect nutrition: increased food for own consumption; increased income; reductions in market prices; shifts in preferences; and shifts in control of resources within households.1 They highlight the substantial influence of gender roles across all five pathways, particularly in relation to increased food availability and increased income. In short, the impact of agricultural interventions on nutrition may depend on two gender-related factors: Does the agricultural intervention enhance women’s control over assets? Does it include nutrition education to ensure better use of the additional food or increased income? Three agricultural development strategies are discussed in this brief, to illustrate the significance of the gender dimension in promoting improved nutrition and health: 1) homestead food production, 2) linking smallholders to markets, and 3) largescale agriculture. A substantial literature documents the role of homestead food production (HFP) in improving nutrition; relatively little research has been done, however, on the health and nutrition implications of other agricultural development strategies.
