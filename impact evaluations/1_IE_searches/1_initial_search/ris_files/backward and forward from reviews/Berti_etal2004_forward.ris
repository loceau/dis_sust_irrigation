TI  - Review of milk and dairy programmes affecting nutrition
PY  - 2013
AB  - This review examined milk programmes affecting nutrition in developing countries through multiple pathways. Four programme typologies were identified: dairy production and agriculture, school-based, fortified milk and milk powder and blended foods. Evidence was rated by inference level with plus signs indicating positive design features: probability (1), plausibility (2) and adequacy (3). Six of the 24 studies were rated 1, demonstrating a causal link between milk intervention and nutrition outcome. High-quality evaluations and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed. Milk programming that capitalises on its nutritional advantages, positive public perception and complementary poverty reduction strategies shows potential for improving nutrition globally.

TI  - How to design a complex behaviour change intervention: experiences from a nutrition-sensitive agriculture trial in rural India.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many public health interventions aim to promote healthful behaviours, with varying degrees of success. With a lack of existing empirical evidence on the optimal number or combination of behaviours to promote to achieve a given health outcome, a key challenge in intervention design lies in deciding what behaviours to prioritise, and how best to promote them. We describe how key behaviours were selected and promoted within a multisectoral nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention that aimed to address maternal and child undernutrition in rural India. First, we formulated a Theory of Change, which outlined our hypothesised impact pathways. To do this, we used the following inputs: existing conceptual frameworks, published empirical evidence, a feasibility study, formative research and the intervention team's local knowledge. Then, we selected specific behaviours to address within each impact pathway, based on our formative research, behaviour change models, local knowledge and community feedback. As the intervention progressed, we mapped each of the behaviours against our impact pathways and the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, to monitor the balance of behaviours across pathways and along stages of behaviour change. By collectively agreeing on definitions of complex concepts and hypothesised impact pathways, implementing partners were able to communicate clearly between each other and with intervention participants. Our intervention was iteratively informed by continuous review, by monitoring implementation against targets and by integrating community feedback. Impact and process evaluations will reveal whether these approaches are effective for improving maternal and child nutrition, and what the effects are on each hypothesised impact pathway.

TI  - DEALING WITH THE GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS IN LOCAL SETTINGS: NONINTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IN LESOTHO, SOUTHERN AFRICA
PY  - 2009
AB  - This article seeks to contribute to efforts toward the identification and critical analysis of sustainable community-based initiatives that could help to ameliorate the impact of the global food crisis in developing countries. To do so, we present a discussion of a sustainable agriculture program in Lesotho, in sub-Saharan Africa. We contextualize the discussion in the framework of both the food crisis and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both of which are taking a major toll in Lesotho. We then present a brief discussion of some of our anthropological contributions to the work of an NGO that is implementing sustainable agriculture initiatives in periurban areas of Lesotho where households are at high risk for food insecurity.

TI  - Impact of livestock interventions on maternal and child nutrition outcomes in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The challenge of undernutrition (stunting and wasting) still remains a major health concern in children below 5 years of age in Africa, with the continent accounting for more than one third of all stunted children and more than one quarter of all wasted children globally. Despite the growing evidence on the role of agriculture interventions in improving nutrition, empirical evidence on the impact of livestock intervention on nutrition in Africa is scant. This review is aimed at determining whether livestock interventions are effective in reducing undernutrition in children below five years of age and in pregnant and lactating women in Africa. The review will be conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Major electronic databases will be searched and complemented with grey and non-indexed literature from google and google scholar, and expert consultation for additional articles and reports. PICO criteria will be used while employing search strategies including MeSH, Boolean search operators and truncation/wildcard symbol to narrow or broaden the search. Articles on effect of livestock interventions on maternal and child nutrition conducted in Africa that meet the set inclusion criteria will be included in the review after critical appraisal by two independent reviewers. A standardized form will be used to extract data from included studies. The extracted data will be summarized and synthesized both qualitatively and quantitatively and key outcomes presented. Evidence generated from the systematic review and meta-analysis will be important for guiding nutrition sensitive livestock interventions and policies on nutrition programming, specifically on how to leverage on livestock interventions to reduce the burden of undernutrition.

TI  - The Impact of Irrigation on Nutrition, Health, and Gender: A Review Paper With Insights for Africa South of the Sahara
PY  - 2013
AB  - Agriculture in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) is still largely rainfed. SSA also exhibits the lowest crop yields for major staples in the world, largely due to low use of irrigation and fertilizer. Rainfed agriculture poses growing production risks with increased climate variability and change. At the same time, smallholder irrigation in the region developed rapidly over the past decade, albeit starting from very low levels. In addition to largely demand-driven irrigation development by smallholders, there is a significant push by donors for large-scale irrigation development, as well as some push for smallholder irrigation. There has also been a long-standing debate about whether irrigation in SSA should be large scale or small scale to achieve its potential. However, given the potentially high rewards, but also high possibility of failure, the assessment of irrigation potential must go beyond large scale versus small scale to integrate concerns regarding environmental sustainability, resource use efficiency, nutrition and health impacts, and women’s empowerment. The hypothesis underlying this review paper is that how irrigation gets deployed in SSA will be decisive not only for environmental sustainability (such as deciding remaining forest cover in the region) and poverty reduction, but also for health, nutrition, and gender outcomes in the region. The focus of this paper is on the health, nutrition, and gender linkage. We find that to date, few studies have analyzed the impact of irrigation interventions on nutrition, health, and women’s empowerment, despite the large potential of irrigation to affect these important variables. Irrigation interventions may have differential effects on different members in the household and in the community, such as irrigators, non-irrigators, children, and women. Measuring and understanding such differences, followed by improving design and implementation to maximize gender, health, and nutrition outcomes, could transform irrigation programs from focusing solely on increased food production toward becoming an integral component of poverty-reduction strategies.

TI  - Nutrition Education and Counselling Provided during Pregnancy: Effects on Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health Outcomes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Nutrition education and counselling (NEC) is a commonly applied strategy to improve maternal nutrition during pregnancy. However, with the exception special populations and specific diets, the effect of NEC on maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes has not been systematically reviewed. Using a modified Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group method we systematically reviewed the literature and identified and abstracted 37 articles. We conducted meta-analyses for the effect of NEC on maternal, neonatal and infant health outcomes including gestational weight gain, maternal anaemia, birthweight, low birthweight and preterm delivery. NEC significantly improved gestational weight gain by 0.45 kg, reduced the risk of anaemia in late pregnancy by 30%, increased birthweight by 105 g and lowered the risk of preterm delivery by 19%. The effect of NEC on risk of low birthweight was not significant. The effect of NEC was greater when provided with nutrition support, for example, food or micronutrient supplements or nutrition safety nets. The overall quality of the body of evidence was deemed low for all outcomes due to high heterogeneity, poor study designs and other biases. Additional well-designed research that is grounded in appropriate theories of behaviour change is needed to improve confidence in the effect of NEC. Further, cost-effectiveness research is needed to clarify the added benefit and sustainability of providing NEC with nutritional support and/or safety nets, especially in areas where food insecurity and gender bias may limit women's capacity to adhere to NEC messages.

TI  - Harmonizing agriculture and health sector actions to improve household nutrition: policy experiences from Afghanistan (2002–2007)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Coordination across sectors to address undernutrition with its varied underlying causes remains a challenge in developing countries. In Afghanistan, harmonization of health and agriculture policies and actions to reduce endemic undernutrition occurred during 2002-2007. This qualitative case study explores the forms of harmonization, enabling features and constraints in the policy process. We interviewed 57 stakeholders (39 central level, 18 provincial) involved in public nutrition or food security issues. Forms of harmonization included written policies, reseach, training and advocacy. Important features of the policy process included: policy entrepreneurs with operational and strategic capacity, consensus-building using a shared causal framework, working groups and strategic alliances. This case presents an interesting alternative to a national nutrition coordinating body, an approach that has met with mixed results, often due to the lack of authority, budget, and operational capacity of such a body to oversee ministries and enforce national nutrition objectives. Mid-level professionals mobilized into task forces achieved much with the support of national and international partners. This study highlights the importance of building capacity for sustaining change through local institutions.

TI  - Can nutrition be promoted through agriculture-led food price policies? A systematic review.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Objective: To systematically review the available evidence on whether national or international agricultural policies that directly affect the price of food influence the prevalence rates of undernutrition or nutrition-related chronic disease in children and adults. Design: Systematic review. Setting: Global. Search strategy: We systematically searched five databases for published literature (MEDLINE, EconLit, Agricola, AgEcon Search, Scopus) and systematically browsed other databases and relevant organisational websites for unpublished literature. Reference lists of included publications were hand-searched for additional relevant studies. We included studies that evaluated or simulated the effects of national or international food-price-related agricultural policies on nutrition outcomes reporting data collected after 1990 and published in English. Primary and secondary outcomes: Prevalence rates of undernutrition (measured with anthropometry or clinical deficiencies) and overnutrition (obesity and nutrition-related chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes). Results: We identified a total of four relevant reports; two ex post evaluations and two ex ante simulations. A study from India reported on the undernutrition rates in children, and the other three studies from Egypt, the Netherlands and the USA reported on the nutritionrelated chronic disease outcomes in adults. Two of the studies assessed the impact of policies that subsidised the price of agricultural outputs and two focused on public food distribution policies. The limited evidence base provided some support for the notion that agricultural policies that change the prices of foods at a national level can have an effect on population-level nutrition and health outcomes. Conclusions: A systematic review of the available literature suggests that there is a paucity of robust direct evidence on the impact of agricultural price policies on nutrition and health.

TI  - How can agricultural interventions contribute in improving nutrition health and achieving the MDGs in least-developed countries?
PY  - 2014
AB  - There are strong conceptual linkages between agricultural development and nutrition improvements which may be categorized into three main pathways: the development, own-production and market pathways. Evidence on the efficacy of these pathways is mixed with some strong, some negative and some weak impacts. These findings reflect both the importance of agriculture for nutrition and the conditionality of that importance on contextual factors. They are also the result of insufficient high-quality empirical research investigating these linkages. The most effective 'pathways' and interventions linking agricultural change to improved nutritional outcomes change with economic growth and development, with declining importance of the development and own-production pathways and increasing importance of the market pathway. Substantial challenges in operationalizing agricultural-nutrition linkages need to be overcome to better exploit potential opportunities.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Agricultural development status impact individual nutrition through food, health and care practices. Many recent studies are focused on the positive side of the impact pathways. However, in some cases, those interventions may have negative outcomes on nutrition. We explore those potential negative outcomes based on a review of scientific papers and institutional reports as well as expert interviews. We identify six categories of risks related to incomes, prices, types of products, women social status and workload, sanitary environment and inequalities.

TI  - Vegetable gardens and their impact on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals
PY  - 2012
AB  - The attainment of the Millennium Development Goals is at severe risk, owing to rising malnutrition and high child stunting and mortality rates, greater poverty, a large increase in the incidence of noncommunicable diseases, and lack of progress in women's empowerment. Here, the role of vegetable home, school, community, and disaster recovery gardens as a pro-poor and pro-environment intervention in the developing world is reviewed. This includes the contribution of vegetable gardens in improving food and nutritional security, generating additional income, providing employment, contributing to better health, and helping to empower disadvantaged groups in society. The implications of global research in the tropics and subtropics over the last 20–30 years are assessed over a wide geographic and linguistic range. The effectiveness and sustainability of such interventions are considered in the light of their contribution to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.

TI  - Key principles to improve programmes and interventions in complementary feeding.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Although there are some examples of successful complementary feeding programmes to promote healthy growth and prevent stunting at the community level, to date there are few, if any, examples of successful programmes at scale. A lack of systematic process and impact evaluations on pilot projects to generate lessons learned has precluded scaling up of effective programmes. Programmes to effect positive change in nutrition rarely follow systematic planning, implementation, and evaluation (PIE) processes to enhance effectiveness over the long term. As a result a set of programme-oriented key principles to promote healthy growth remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by proposing a set of principles to improve programmes and interventions to promote healthy growth and development. Identifying such principles for programme success has three requirements: rethinking traditional paradigms used to promote improved infant and young child feeding; ensuring better linkages to delivery platforms; and, improving programming. Following the PIE model for programmes and learning from experiences from four relatively large-scale programmes described in this paper, 10 key principles are identified in the areas of programme planning, programme implementation, programme evaluation, and dissemination, replication, and scaling up. Nonetheless, numerous operational research questions remain, some of which are highlighted in this paper.

TI  - Agroforestry diversity, indigenous food consumption and nutritional outcomes in Sauria Paharia tribal women of Jharkhand, India.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Like several indigenous populations, Sauria Paharias, a vulnerable indigenous tribal group residing in a biodiverse environment of Jharkhand, India, have high levels of undernutrition. We assessed agroforestry and dietary diversity, food consumption especially indigenous food (IF) intake and nutritional status of Sauria Paharia women through a cross-sectional study conducted in 18 villages of Godda district, Jharkhand. Household level information was elicited through household surveys including a dietary survey and a food frequency questionnaire. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls (24 HDR) and anthropometric assessments were taken on one randomly selected woman per household. An index, Food Accessed Diversity Index (FADI) created to measure agroforestry diversity, showed a low mean score of 0.21 ± 0.15 and range: 0, 0.85. Fifty-nine percent of women consumed any IF during 24 HDR. Median minimum dietary diversity score for women (MDD-W) was 3 (acceptable score ≥5). More than 96% of women had intakes below estimated average requirements for all nutrients studied (energy; vitamins A, C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine; folate; iron; calcium and zinc) except protein; 41% women were underweight. IF consumption was independently associated with calcium and vitamin A intake. Decision trees developed for micronutrient consumption at different levels of MDD-W score and IF consumption scenarios revealed 1.3 to 2.9 times higher consumption of micronutrients among women with MDD-W ≥ 3 or 4. Strategies like agricultural extension programmes promoting indigenous varieties and nutrition education for increasing dietary diversity with IFs have potential to address undernutrition in Sauria Paharia women.

TI  - Garden-based interventions and early childhood health: an umbrella review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Garden-based interventions show promise for improving not only child nutrition, but other indicators of child health. Yet, existing systematic reviews of garden-based interventions often focus on one particular health outcome or setting, creating a need to holistically summarize review-level evidence on the role of garden-based interventions in early childhood. To fill this gap, we performed an umbrella review of garden-based interventions to examine their role in early childhood health promotion for children ages 6 years and younger, examining effective components of garden-based interventions and critically evaluating existing evidence. We searched the following databases: PubMed, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, OVID-Agricola, and CAB Direct, limiting to reviews published from 1990 to August 2019. Of the 9457 references identified, we included a total of 16 unique reviews for analysis. Across reviews, garden based-interventions were most effective at improving nutrition-related outcomes for children, including nutritional status and fruit and vegetable consumption. Few reviews examined child health outcomes of garden-based interventions that were not nutrition related, such as physical activity, or academic performance. Across settings, there was the most evidence in support of garden-based interventions conducted in home gardens, compared to evidence from early care and education or community settings. We were unable to report on most effective components of garden-based interventions due to limitations of included reviews. Existing evidence is difficult to interpret due to methodological limitations at both the review and primary study level. Therefore, the lack of evidence for certain child health outcomes should not necessarily be interpreted as an absence of an effect of garden-based interventions for specific outcomes, but as a product of these limitations. Given the breadth of evidence for garden-based interventions to improve a number of dimensions of health with older children and adult populations, we highlight areas of future research to address evidence gaps identified in this umbrella review. Further research on the role of garden-based interventions, including their impact on non-nutrition early childhood health outcomes and how effectiveness differs by setting type is necessary to fully understand their role in early childhood health promotion.

TI  - Extension Services, Production and Welfare Evidence from a Field Experiment in Ethiopia
PY  - 2015
AB  - The paper assesses the impact of a small-scale agricultural extension project implemented in rural Ethiopia and aimed at introducing the cultivation of horticultural gardens along with some innovative techniques, products and inputs. Our main outcome of interest is the level of adoption of new horticultural products. We also assess the consequent impacts on the level of revenues from sale and diet diversification. We use a mixed impact evaluation design combining across-villages comparisons, through difference-in-differences estimations, with a within village randomized control trial. To this aim, we make use of micro-data collected through surveys administered to 602 households in two time periods (2013 and 2014). We find that the project contributes to production diversification as the number of households growing vegetables increases by about 30%. Overall, such changes do not seem to influence in a relevant way the total revenues from sales of agricultural products and do not consequently affect household welfare. We do not find significant changes in the consumption of vegetables and only marginal increase in fruit uptake. This leads to an overall irrelevant impact on diet diversification.

The objective of this research was to characterize the levels of malnutrition and describe infant feeding practices in Potosi, Bolivia and use this information to develop an effective, gender sensitive and culturally relevant intervention encouraging good infant feeding practices. Standard methods were used to collect anthropometric data. Weight and height data were collected for 400 children under five years of age from 30 communities. In six of these communities, interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 33 mothers and other families in addition to household observational data that were collected to describe infant feeding practices. Nearly 20% of children were underweight; stunting was widespread as well. 38% of mothers initiated breastfeeding 12 hours or more after birth. 39% of mothers initiated complementary feeding in the first three months following birth. The type of complementary food given to children was usually inadequate. With this research we could see that nutritional deficiencies often begin when the mother starts breastfeeding and when first introduced complementary feeding. Interventions aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition will require changes in parents' behavior, greater recognition and community support of the importance of child feeding, and the inclusion of strategies to reach young people, involve men, and make high quality nutrition promotion more widely available in the communities.

TI  - Impact assessment of agricultural technologies on household food consumption and dietary diversity in eastern Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Food insecurity remains a major challenge to rural households in Eastern Ethiopia. To improve food and nutrition security of vulnerable households in eastern Ethiopia, several agricultural technologies have been scaled-up by Haramaya University for more than six decades. However, the impact of these technologies on household nutritional outcomes was not systematically studied. This study examined the impact of selected agricultural technologies on household food and nutrition security. Cross-sectional data were generated from 248 randomly selected rural households. Of these, 52% were non-users of improved agricultural technologies disseminated by the university while the remaining 48% sample respondents were users. The data generated from the field were analyzed using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) procedure and descriptive statistics. Results from the econometric analysis result show that households that adopted agricultural technologies had, on average, 8.97 higher Food Consumption Score (FCS) and 1.22 higher Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) compared to those not using improved technologies. This shows that households adopting agricultural technologies are more likely to have higher food security compared to non-users. This suggests that promotion of improved agricultural technologies in the study area can enhance household food and nutrition security.

TI  - Evaluating interventions to improve child nutrition in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objective The prevention of malnutrition in children under two approach (PM2A), women's empowerment and agricultural interventions have not been widely evaluated in relation to child diet and nutrition outcomes. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of PM2A, women's empowerment groups (WEG), farmer field schools (FFS) and farmer-to-farmer training (F2F). Design Community-matched quasi-experimental design; outcome measures included children's dietary diversity, stunting and underweight. Setting Communities in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.ParticipantsA total of 1312 children from 1113 households. Results Achievement of minimum dietary diversity ranged from 22·9 to 39·7 % and was significantly greater in the PM2A and FFS groups (Pl0·05 for both comparisons). Fewer than 7·6 and 5·8 % of children in any group met minimum meal frequency and acceptable diet targets; only the PM2A group differed significantly from controls (Pl0·05 for both comparisons). The endline stunting prevalence ranged from 54·7 % (PM2A) to 69·1 % (F2F) and underweight prevalence from 22·3 % (FFS) to 34·4 % (F2F). No significant differences were found between intervention groups and controls for nutrition measures; however, lower prevalences of stunting (PM2A, -4 %) and underweight (PM2A and FFS, -7 %) suggest potential impact on nutrition outcomes. Conclusions Children in the PM2A and FFS groups had better child diet measures and nutrition outcomes with the best results among PM2A beneficiaries. Interventions that address multiple aspects nutrition education, health, ration provision and income generation may be more effective in improving child diet and nutrition in resource-poor settings than stand-alone approaches.

TI  - "When I Eat Well, I Will Be Healthy, and the Child Will Also Be Healthy": Maternal Nutrition among HIV-Infected Women Enrolled in a Livelihood Intervention in Western Kenya.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Author(s): McDonough, Annie; Weiser, Sheri D; Daniel, Afkera; Weke, Elly; Wekesa, Pauline; Burger, Rachel; Sheira, Lila; Bukusi, Elizabeth A; Cohen, Craig R | Abstract: Background:Food insecurity remains a major obstacle to achieving health and well-being for individuals living with HIV in western Kenya. Studies have shown that pregnant women are vulnerable to experiencing food insecurity worldwide, with significant consequences for both maternal and child health. The Shamba Maisha cluster randomized controlled trial in western Kenya (which means "farming for life" in Swahili) tested the effects of a multisectoral livelihood intervention consisting of agricultural and finance trainings, farm inputs, and a loan on health and food security among 746 farmers living with HIV in Kisumu, Homa Bay, and Migori Counties. Objectives:We conducted a qualitative substudy within the Shamba Maisha trial to understand the experiences and perspectives of pregnant women living with HIV enrolled in the trial. Methods:Thirty women who had experienced a pregnancy during the Shamba Maisha study period, comprising 20 women in the intervention arm and 10 women in the control arm, completed in-depth interviews using a semistructured interview guide. Results:Intervention participants interviewed noted improvements in maternal nutrition compared with previous pregnancies, which they attributed to the livelihood intervention. Key identified pathways to improved nutrition included improved access to vegetables, increased variety of diet through vegetable sales, and improved nutritional awareness. Women in the intervention arm also perceived increased weight gain compared with prior pregnancies and increased strength and energy throughout pregnancy. Conclusions:Livelihood interventions represent a promising solution to alleviate food insecurity for pregnant women in order to improve maternal and child health outcomes.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02815579.

TI  - School-based gardening, cooking and nutrition intervention increased vegetable intake but did not reduce BMI: Texas sprouts - a cluster randomized controlled trial.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Although school garden programs have been shown to improve dietary behaviors, there has not been a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted to examine the effects of school garden programs on obesity or other health outcomes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a one-year school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention (called Texas Sprouts) on dietary intake, obesity outcomes, and blood pressure in elementary school children. This study was a school-based cluster RCT with 16 elementary schools that were randomly assigned to either the Texas Sprouts intervention (n = 8 schools) or to control (delayed intervention, n = 8 schools). The intervention was one school year long (9 months) and consisted of: a) Garden Leadership Committee formation; b) a 0.25-acre outdoor teaching garden; c) 18 student gardening, nutrition, and cooking lessons taught by trained educators throughout the school-year; and d) nine monthly parent lessons. The delayed intervention was implemented the following academic year and received the same protocol as the intervention arm. Child outcomes measured were anthropometrics (i.e., BMI parameters, waist circumference, and body fat percentage via bioelectrical impedance), blood pressure, and dietary intake (i.e., vegetable, fruit, and sugar sweetened beverages) via survey. Data were analyzed with complete cases and with imputations at random. Generalized weighted linear mixed models were used to test the intervention effects and to account for clustering effect of sampling by school. A total of 3135 children were enrolled in the study (intervention n = 1412, 45%). Average age was 9.2 years, 64% Hispanic, 47% male, and 69% eligible for free and reduced lunch. The intervention compared to control resulted in increased vegetable intake (+ 0.48 vs. + 0.04 frequency/day, p = 0.02). There were no effects of the intervention compared to control on fruit intake, sugar sweetened beverages, any of the obesity measures or blood pressure. While this school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking program did not reduce obesity markers or blood pressure, it did result in increased vegetable intake. It is possible that a longer and more sustained effect of increased vegetable intake is needed to lead to reductions in obesity markers and blood pressure. NCT02668744 .

TI  - Using Program Impact Pathways to Understand and Improve Program Delivery, Utilization, and Potential for Impact of Helen Keller International's Homestead Food Production Program in Cambodia:
PY  - 2013
AB  - BackgroundEvidence of the impact of homestead food production programs on nutrition outcomes such as anemia and growth is scant. In the absence of information on program impact pathways, it is difficult to understand why these programs, which have been successful in increasing intake of micronutrient-rich foods, have had such limited documented impact on nutrition outcomes.ObjectiveTo conduct a process evaluation of Helen Keller International's (HKI's) homestead food production program in Cambodia to assess whether the program was operating as planned (in terms of design, delivery, and utilization) and to identify ways in which the program might need to be strengthened in order to increase its potential for impact.MethodsA program theory framework, which laid out the primary components along the hypothesized program impact pathways, was developed in collaboration with HKI and used to design the research.

TI  - The impact of gender equity in agriculture on nutritional status, diets, and household food security: a mixed-methods systematic review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Introduction Undernutrition rates remain high in rural, low-income settings, where large, gender-based inequities persist. We hypothesised that increasing gender equity in agriculture could improve nutrition. Methods We conducted a systematic review to assess the associations between gender-based inequities (in income, land, livestock, and workloads) and nutrition, diets and food security outcomes in agricultural contexts of low-income and middle-income countries. Between 9 March and 7 August 2018, we searched 18 databases and 14 journals, and contacted 27 experts. We included quantitative and qualitative literature from agricultural contexts in low-income and middle-income countries, with no date restriction. Outcomes were women’s and children’s anthropometric status, dietary quality and household food security. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. Results We identified 19 820 records, of which 34 studies (42 809 households) met the inclusion criteria. Most (22/25) quantitative studies had a high risk of bias, and qualitative evidence was of mixed quality. Income, land and livestock equity had heterogeneous associations with household food security and child anthropometric outcomes. Meta-analyses showed women’s share of household income earned (0.32, 95% CI −4.22 to 4.86; six results) and women’s share of land owned (2.72, 95% CI -0.52 to 5.96; three results) did not increase the percentage of household budget spent on food. Higher-quality studies showed more consistently positive associations between income equity and food security. Evidence is limited on other exposure–outcome pairings. Conclusions We find heterogeneous associations between gender equity and household-level food security. High-quality research is needed to establish the impact of gender equity on nutrition outcomes across contexts.

TI  - A Farming System Model to Leverage Agriculture for Nutritional Outcomes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Agriculture is the primary livelihood of a majority of the population in South Asia. The region also houses a large population of undernourished people. The farming system for nutrition (FSN) model envisages developing and demonstrating a sustainable framework of farming to improve nutritional outcomes that can be used for upscaling and wider adoption. Agricultural intervention and farming systems research in India has been largely focused on enhancing production, productivity and profitability of crop and animal resources without much emphasis on better nutritional outcomes. The FSN model has been conceptualized to develop location-specific inclusive models to address the nutritional needs of farm and non-farm families based on their resource endowments and surrounding environment. The main components of the model are as follows: (1) survey to identify the major nutritional problems, (2) design suitable agricultural interventions to address the problems, (3) include specific nutritional criteria in the design, (4) improve small farm productivity and profitability, (5) undertake nutrition awareness programmes and (6) introduce monitoring systems for assessing impact on nutrition outcomes. The objective is to demonstrate feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The proposed model is being tested in two select locations to demonstrate improvement in nutrition status through improved agricultural production system, dietary diversification, income enhancement, greater nutrition awareness and changed behaviour patterns, to be evaluated through a set of objective indicators.

TI  - Connecting genebanks to farmers in East Africa through the distribution of vegetable seed kits
PY  - 2019
AB  - Genebanks explore new partnerships with farmers and other user groups to provide smallholder farmers in Africa better access to crop diversity for improved nutrition, climate change adaptation and agricultural diversification. This paper shows how the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg) genebank of traditional African vegetables and its partners distributed over 42,000 seed kits containing over 183,000 vegetable seed samples from 2013 to 2017 to smallholder farmers in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. The seed kits contained seed samples of promising accessions and open-pollinated breeding lines of traditional African vegetables, and to a lower degree of tomato, Capsicum pepper and soybean, usually enough to plant in a home garden. We identified four research questions to better understand the role of vegetable seed kits in strengthening local seed systems, impact on local vegetable diversity, improving human nutrition and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. As formal seed systems expand their reach, the genebank's role to supply vegetable diversity to public and private breeding programmes becomes more important. To optimize supply of vegetable diversity, the WorldVeg genebank of traditional African vegetables continues working with partners in both formal and local seed systems.

TI  - Gender differences in agricultural technology adoption in developing countries: a systematic review
PY  - 2019
AB  - The color adoption of agricultural technologies varies across societies, persons and gender. Studies have shown that women have lower levels and slower rates of adoption of various agricultural technologies than men. In view of these, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the lines of arguments and factors influencing gender differences in technology adoption. The search for literature was conducted through AGORA, Google Scholar, Freefullpdf, Jstor, Science Domain, and Elsevier online databases. Also data were sourced from Awolowo University (Africana Section), Nigeria- Canada Project (NiCanVeg) and MicroVeg project. The findings from most studies showed consensus of male dominance in agricultural technology adoption despite the high proportion of women involvement in agriculture. The factors influencing gender differences in technology adoption included; access to resources (land, labor, capital, non-farm income, inputs and extension services), educational level, distance to market, decision making power, participation in associations, norms and beliefs among others. It was concluded that gender equality in agricultural technology adoption are not yet achieved because women are still constrained by several factors in employing their full potentials in agricultural production. There is, therefore, need for deliberate planning to mainstream gender into agricultural innovations to guarantee equality in its adoption between men and women in developing countries.

PY  - 2007
AB  - BackgroundUrban agriculture is an important livelihood strategy to increase access to and availability of food in urban settings.ObjectiveWe examined the impact of sociodemographic and farming variables on the household food security and nutritional security of an index child aged 2 to 5 years. Our hypothesis was that dietary quality (percentage of energy from animal-source foods [%ASF] and dietary diversity) would have an impact on infection (as measured by C-reactive protein [CRP]), which in turn would have an impact on biochemical indices (hemoglobin and retinol) and anthropometric indices (weight-for-age z-score [WAZ] and body mass index z-score [ZBMI]). We examined the relationships among urban agricultural activities, household food security, and child nutritional security.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of 296 households within each randomly selected study zone in Kampala, Uganda.

TI  - Assessing the Potential and Limitations of Leveraging Food Sovereignty to Improve Human Health
PY  - 2015
AB  - Food sovereignty has been defined as "the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems." Human health is an implied component of this definition through the principle of healthy food. In fact, improved human health is commonly cited as a benefit of transforming food production away from the dominant practices of industrial agriculture. Yet, does the use of "ecologically sound and sustainable methods" of food production necessarily translate into better human health outcomes? Does greater choice in defining an agricultural or food system create gains in health and well-being? We elucidate the conceptual linkages between food sovereignty and human health, critically examine the empirical evidence supporting or refuting these linkages, and identify research gaps and key priorities for the food sovereignty-human health research agenda. Five domains of food sovereignty are discussed including: (1) use of agroecological management practices for food production, (2) the localization of food production and consumption, (3) promotion of social justice and equity, (4) valuation of traditional knowledge, and (5) the transformation of economic and political institutions and structures to support self-determination. We find that although there are many plausible linkages between food sovereignty and human health, the empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that increasing food sovereignty yields improvements to human health is weak. We propose that a concerted effort to generate new empirical evidence on the health implications of these domains of food sovereignty is urgently needed, and suggest areas of research that may be crucial for addressing the gaps in the evidence base.

TI  - Agriculture, nutrition and the green revolution in Bangladesh☆
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract This paper explores agriculture and nutrition linkages in Bangladesh, a country that achieved rapid growth in rice productivity at a relatively late stage in Asia's Green Revolution, as well as unheralded progress against undernutrition. To do so, we first outline a simple conceptual model to identify the different impacts that productivity growth in a food staple(s) might have on child nutrition outcomes, with a particular focus on changes in diets at the household and child level. We then apply this framework to a descriptive overview of the evolution of Bangladesh's food system in recent decades. We show that this evolution is characterized rapid growth in yields and calorie availability, but relatively sluggish diversification in both food production and consumption, despite increasing reliance on imports for dietary diversification. Next, we create a multi-round district level panel that links changes in nutrition survey data with agricultural sample survey data over 1996–2011, a period in which rice yields rose by more than 70%. We then use this panel to more rigorously test for associations between yield growth and various anthropometric and child feeding indicators. Consistent with our descriptive evidence on dietary changes, we find that rice yields predict the earlier introduction of complementary foods to young children (most frequently rice) as well as increases in their weight-for-height, but no improvements in their dietary diversity or height-for-age. Since Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child wasting in the world, these significant associations between yields and child weight gain are encouraging, but the lack of discernible effects on children's dietary diversity or linear growth is cause for concern. Indeed, it suggests that further nutritional impacts will require diversifying the Bangladeshi food basket through both supply and demand-side interventions.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Animal Husbandry and Capture on Anemia among Women and Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Animal husbandry and capture (AHC) may mitigate anemia among women and children by supplying a source of micronutrient-rich animal source foods (ASF), yet may concurrently increase exposure to anemia-inducing pathogens such as Plasmodium spp., helminths, and enteropathogens. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the relation between AHC and anemia among women of reproductive age, school-aged children, and children aged <5 y in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used a 2-stage screening process, in which 1 reviewer searched 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health) with predetermined search terms for relevant articles. Two reviewers then independently screened studies using a priori exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 23 articles included in the final review. We evaluated evidence from observational studies assessing animal-dependent livelihoods and livestock ownership, and interventions that promoted livestock and fish production. We found little consistency in anemia outcomes across the several AHC exposures and population groups. Poultry production interventions had modest benefits on anemia among women and children, although whether these improvements were a result of increased ASF consumption, or a result of the combined treatment study design could not be determined. Observational studies identified chicken ownership, and no other livestock species, as a risk factor for anemia among young children. However, there was limited evidence to evaluate pathways underlying these associations. Studies tended to rely on self-reported fever and diarrhea to assess illness, and no study directly assessed linkages between AHC, pathogen burden, and anemia. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether AHC improves or worsens anemia among women and children in LMICs. Given the current interest in promoting animal production among low-income households, future studies with robust measures of livestock ownership, ASF consumption, pathogen burden, and anemia status are needed to understand the nuances of this complex and potentially contradictory relation.

TI  - It’s more than climate change and active transport-physical activity’s role in sustainable behavior
PY  - 2021
AB  - Considering the interdependence of human's and nature's health within the planetary health concept, we evaluated how physical activity (PA) can be conceptualized as sustainable behavior (SuB) and how PA relates to other types of SuBs within the United Nations' sustainable development goal (SDG) framework. Regarding social SDGs, PA contributes to improving malnutrition (SDG 2), health behaviors (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), sustainable cities (SDG 12), and peace (SDG 16). For ecological SDGs, PA contributes to sustainable consumption (SDG 11) and combating climate change (SDG 13). Therefore, PA is more than a health behavior, it contributes to planetary health and sustainable development. However, caution is warranted as PA also has the potential to contribute and reinforce unsustainability. Thus, PA as a SuB requires an own research agenda, investigating (a) PA as social and ecological SuB, (b) sustainable PA promotion, (c) sustainable PA measurement, (d) common underlying constructs of PA and SuB, and (e) technology's role to assess and promote PA and SuB.

TI  - Agriculture, food, and nutrition interventions that facilitate sustainable food production and impact health: an overview of systematic reviews
PY  - 2016
AB  - Objectives To identify the agriculture, food, and nutrition security interventions that facilitate sustainable food production and have a positive impact on health. Methods Systematic review methods were used to synthesize evidence from multiple systematic reviews and economic evaluations through a comprehensive search of 17 databases and 10 websites. The search employed a pre-defined protocol with clear inclusion criteria. Both grey and peer-reviewed literature published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese between 1 January 1997 and November 2013 were included. To classify as "sustainable," interventions needed to aim to positively impact at least two dimensions of the integrated framework for sustainable development and include measures of health impact. Results Fifteen systematic reviews and seven economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. All interventions had some impact on health or on risk factors for health outcomes, except those related to genetically modified foods. Impact on health inequalities was rarely measured. All interventions with economic evaluations were very cost-effective, had cost savings, or net benefits. In addition to impacting health (inclusive social development), all interventions had the potential to impact on inclusive economic development, and some, on environmental sustainability, though these effects were rarely assessed. Conclusions What is needed now is careful implementation of interventions with expected positive health impacts but with concurrent, rigorous evaluation. Possible impact on health inequalities needs to be considered and measured by future primary studies and systematic reviews, as does impact of interventions on all dimensions of sustainable development.

TI  - Evidence on Key Policies for African Agricultural Growth
PY  - 2013
AB  - It is widely agreed that reducing poverty in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) depends largely on stimulating growth in agriculture. To this end, heads of state in Africa rallied to form the pan-African Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) with the goal of raising investments and improving strategy implementation. However, while implementing an agricultural agenda under the CAADP framework, more and more countries have realized that increasing public investment in agriculture alone is not enough. Policy can play an important role not only to make public investment more efficient, but also is crucial for incentivizing private sector and farmer investment in agriculture. Against this backdrop this paper takes stock of current agricultural policies in SSA with a view to identifying policies that are working as well as areas for improvement. The paper examines policies to encourage the adoption of agricultural inputs, initiate greater private-sector investment in agriculture and agro-industries, and manage price volatility while encouraging openness. The paper further reviews successful land tenure policies and property rights systems, reviews the evidence on the synergies between agriculture and nutrition, and examines how CAADP is laying the institutional architecture for improved policy formulation in Africa. In general, the paper finds that although substantial progress has been made, there is considerable scope for improvement. This is not surprising given the relatively primitive and deeply rooted nature of smallholder farming in Africa. Evidence synthesized in the paper supports the view that most policies cannot be implemented in isolation. Rather, policies tend to be most effective when implemented along with complementary policies and public investments.

TI  - Resource integration in smallholder farms for sustainable livelihoods in developing countries
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractThe need for sustainable agricultural advancements remain at the forefront of global development practices, with smallholder farms emerging as an essential factor in creating long-lasting improvements in food security, enhanced nutrition, and economic development. Sustainable intensification and diversification in small farms can achieve these outcomes and often take the form of integration among farm resources to achieve sustainable livelihood. However, such integration is promoted in the form of integrated farming system (IFS) models as a single farm innovation for the smallholder systems of developing countries without considering the heterogeneity and priorities of farm families. Using the sustainable livelihoods (SL) framework, we propose a modified model for IFS promotion, particularly applicable for developing nations. The model modifies the standard SL model and illustrates how, based on the resources and vulnerabilities of small farms, IFS needs to be customised to achieve multifunctional...

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programme impacts on time use and associations with nutrition outcomes.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Success of nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes targeted to women may be influenced by increased demands on women's and other household members' time and by time-related trade-offs to accommodate programme participation. However, evidence of how such programmes impact time use and whether changes in time-related demands negatively influence maternal or child health and nutrition outcomes is limited. This paper examines the impact of Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production programme in Burkina Faso (2010-2012) on women's and men's time use and associations between changes in women's time use and maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes. We used quantitative data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial (baseline 2010, endline 2012) and qualitative data from two rounds of process evaluation (2011, 2012). Two-stage analyses were used to first assess programme impacts on women's and men's time use using difference-in-difference impact estimates and second to evaluate whether programme impacts on women's time use were associated with changes in women's and children's health and nutrition outcomes. Programme impacts were considered significant if corrected P < 0.01, and associations were considered significant if p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. Qualitative data were analysed through manual coding and by calculating the means and standard deviations for the time spent by women and men on activities in intervention and control groups. Findings show that the programme significantly increased the amount of time women spent on agriculture in the intervention compared to the control group, but this was not associated with changes in maternal or child health or nutrition outcomes. Process evaluation data supported these findings.

TI  - Food Security and Nutrition Outcomes of Farmer Field Schools in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background Food and nutrition security in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are threatened by political instability and chronic poverty. The Jenga Jamaa II project, implemented between 2011 and 2016 in South Kivu Province, aimed to improve household food security and child nutritional status using various intervention strategies, including farmer field school (FFS) programs. Objective To characterize the changes in agricultural production techniques, household food security, and child nutritional status associated with participation in FFS programs. Methods We used a community-matched design to select FFS intervention and control households from 3 health zones in which the project was operating. Data on food security (Household Dietary Diversity Score [HDDS] and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale [HFIAS]) and child anthropometry were collected semiannually for 3.5 years in both groups. Additional data on agricultural practices were collected annually in the FFS group only. Focus groups with FFS staff and beneficiaries were conducted in the final project year. Statistical analyses included basic descriptive statistics such as paired t tests and analysis of covariance; regression models using a bootstrap were applied to generate P values and confidence intervals while accounting for differences between groups. Results The study enrolled 388 FFS beneficiaries and their households in the intervention group and 324 non-FFS households in the control group. FFS participants reported increasing the number of different agricultural techniques they used by an average of 2.7 techniques over the project period, from 5.1 in 2013 to 7.9 in 2016 (P .05). Conclusion Although FFS participants diversified their agricultural production strategies and experienced improvements in household food security, there was not a positive impact on child nutritional status. In this food-insecure context, improvements in agricultural production alone are unlikely to significantly change child nutritional status-a health outcome with a complex, multilevel causal chain.

TI  - Women’s education level amplifies the effects of a livelihoods-based intervention on household wealth, child diet, and child growth in rural Nepal
PY  - 2017
AB  - Many organizations seek to alleviate poverty in the developing world, often focusing their interventions on women. The role, status, and education of women are fundamentally important facets of development. Thus, understanding the interaction of women’s educational level and the response to interventions is important. Therefore, we examined the impact of educational level of household adults on responses to a livestock-based community intervention. Six pair-matched communities in 3 districts of Nepal (Chitwan/Nawalparasi/Nuwakot), were randomly assigned to receive community development activities via women’s self-help groups at baseline or 1 year later. At 6 intervals over 48 months, a 125- item questionnaire addressing family demographics and child health/nutrition was completed in each household, plus child growth monitoring. Results were analyzed in relation to the highest education attained by any woman in the household, the child’s mother, men, or any other adult in the household. Outcomes (wealth, water/toilet availability, child diet diversity and growth) all significantly related to adult education. However, notable differences were found comparing the impact of men’s and women’s education. Percent change in wealth score was significant only in households where women had primary or secondary education (respectively, p = .0009 and p < .0001). Increased soap use related only to women’s education (p < .0001). When adjusted for group assignment, baseline income, wealth, and animal scores, higher women’s education was significantly associated with increased household wealth (p < .0001), better child height-for-age z scores (HAZ, p = .005), and improved child diet diversity (p = .01). Higher mother’s education predicted better child HAZ (primary, p = .01, secondary, p = .03) and diet diversity (primary, p = .05, secondary, p < .0001). Higher men’s education was significantly associated with household wealth (p = .02) and child diet diversity (p = .04), but not HAZ; higher education of any household member was associated only with household wealth (p < .0001). Moreover, households where the mother’s education was better than the best-educated man also were significantly more likely to have children with better HAZ and dietary diversity (p = .03, p < .0001). Thus, the educational level of women and mothers had the broadest impact on child outcome variables. Household characteristics vary among participants in most community development projects. Of these, adult education likely mediates response to the inputs provided by the intervention. Particularly in interventions directed towards women, better education may enhance the ability of households to put interventions into practice, thus improving wealth, hygiene, and child diet and growth indices.

TI  - Effectiveness of agricultural interventions that aim to improve nutritional status of children: systematic review
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of agricultural interventions in improving the nutritional status of children in developing countries. Design Systematic review. Data sources Published and unpublished reports (after 1990) in English identified by searching 10 databases (Agris, Econlit, Eldis, IBSS, IDEAS, IFPRI, Jolis, PubMed, Web of Science, and World Bank), websites, previous systematic reviews, and reference lists and by contacting experts. Study selection Included studies assessed effects of agricultural interventions aiming at improving the nutritional status of children (bio-fortification, home gardens, small scale fisheries and aquaculture, dairy development, and animal husbandry and poultry development). Only studies that used a valid counterfactual analysis were included. Before/after studies and participants/non-participants comparisons affected by selection bias were excluded. Data analysis Results were analysed for four intermediate outcomes (programme participation, income, dietary diversity, and micronutrient intake) and one final outcome (prevalence of under-nutrition). Analysis was by summary tables of mean effects and by meta-analysis (for vitamin A absorption). Results The review included 23 studies, mostly evaluating home garden interventions. The studies reviewed did not report participation rates or the characteristics of participants in programmes. The interventions had a positive effect on the production of the agricultural goods promoted, but not on households’ total income. The interventions were successful in promoting the consumption of food rich in protein and micronutrients, but the effect on the overall diet of poor people remains unclear. No evidence was found of an effect on the absorption of iron, but some evidence exists of a positive effect on absorption of vitamin A. Very little evidence was found of a positive effect on the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children aged under 5. Conclusions The question posed by the review cannot be answered with any level of confidence. The data available show a poor effect of these interventions on nutritional status, but methodological weaknesses of the studies cast serious doubts on the validity of these results. More rigorous and better designed studies are needed, as well as the establishment of agreed quality standards to guide researchers in this important area.

TI  - The aggregate income losses from childhood stunting and the returns to a nutrition intervention aimed at reducing stunting
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper undertakes two calculations, one for all developing countries, the other for 34 developing countries that together account for 90 percent of the world's stunted children. The first calculation asks how much lower a country's per capita income is today as a result of some of its workers having been stunted in childhood. The analysis uses a development accounting framework, relying on micro-econometric estimates of the effects of childhood stunting on adult wages, through the effects on years of schooling, cognitive skills, and height, parsing out the relative contribution of each set of returns to avoid double counting. The estimates show that, on average, the per capita income penalty from stunting is around 7 percent. The second calculation estimates the economic value and the costs associated with scaling up a package of nutrition interventions using the same methodology and set of assumptions used in the first calculation. The analysis considers a package of 10 nutrition interventions for which data are available on the effects and costs. The estimated rate-of-return from gradually introducing this program over a period of 10 years in the 34 countries is17 percent, and the corresponding benefit-cost ratio is 15:1.

TI  - Potential relationship between malaria elimination and reducing stunting in children in sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: The Sustainable Development Goals include goals to reduce malaria and stunting. Stunting is a result of childhood undernutrition. Our previous studies found that suppressing malaria could reduce poverty rates among agricultural households in Africa. The objective of this paper is to highlight how suppressing malaria could have the further effect of reducing stunting rates among children in agricultural households. Methods: We estimated the burden of stunting among children in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa on the basis of our previous research and data from UNICEF. We also used an evaluation of the impact of a nutrition program in Peru to assess the potential for poverty reduction to reduce stunting. Results: We estimated that there are approximately 21.5 million children suffering from stunting in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty reduction was found to be a necessary condition to reduce stunting via a multisectoral nutrition program in Peru. The potential impact of suppressing malaria on the poverty rate of agricultural households could therefore play an important role in nutrition programs aiming to reduce stunting in Africa. Reducing the number of children with stunting in these households would improve their health and productivity as adults. Conclusion: We have developed the first estimates of the burden of stunting in agricultural households in malarious regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding how suppressing malaria affects stunting in these households could affect funding for anti-malaria programs. Future research should use longitudinal data to examine this impact at a finer spatial scale.

TI  - What are the impacts of urban agriculture programs on food security in low and middle-income countries: a systematic review
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Urban Agriculture is considered to contribute to improved food security among the income poor in urban contexts across developing countries. Much literature exists on the topic assuming a positive relationship. The aim of this review was to collect and analyse available evidence on the impact of urban agriculture in low and middle-income countries. Methods: We employed systematic review methods to identify all relevant and reliable research on UA’s impact on food security and nutrition. Only impact evaluations that set out to measure the effectiveness of UA interventions on food security, as compared to the effects of not engaging in UA, qualified for inclusion. Studies had to have a comparison group and at least two data points. Results: Systematic searches resulted in 8142 hits, and screening of abstracts resulted in 198 full texts identified. No studies met the review’s inclusion criteria. Therefore, the review found no available evidence that supports or refutes the suggestion that urban agriculture positively impacts on individual or household food security in low and middle-income countries. The largest proportion of studies at full text stage was excluded based on study design, as they were not impact evaluations, i.e. they did not have a comparison group and at least data points. Two observations were made: Firstly, searches yielded a range of studies that consider associations between UA and certain aspects of food security. Secondly, there is a large pool of cross-sectional studies on UA’s potential to contribute to increased food security, particularly from west and east Africa. Conclusions: The research currently available does not allow for any conclusions to be made on whether or not urban agriculture initiatives contribute to food security. The fact that impact evaluations are absent from the current evidence-base calls for increased efforts to measure the impact of urban agriculture on food security in low and middle-income countries through rigorous impact evaluations. With regard to systematic review methodology, this review alludes to the value of compiling a systematic map prior to engaging in a full systematic review.

TI  - Evolution and impact of EU aid for food and nutrition security: a review
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the aftermath of the world food price crisis, the issue of food and nutrition security has received a high level of political attention and the international donor community has repeatedly underlined its commitment to combat hunger in the world. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the international community’s efforts in addressing the widespread problem of malnutrition, we need to improve our knowledge on what activities donors are currently engaging in and which interventions have been shown to be successful. This paper offers both an overview of the aid for food and nutrition security landscape and how it has changed and an extensive review of the available evidence on the impact of a wide array of interventions aimed at addressing all four dimensions of food and nutrition security; availability, access, utilization and stability. We find that despite the renewed interest and elevated levels of funding for food and nutrition security assistance in developing countries, the empirical evidence base for the effectiveness of these interventions in improving beneficiaries’ food and nutrition security – although in several cases promising – is weak. In particular, the question whether different interventions improve the quality of food consumption and consequently nutrient intake and status, remains largely unanswered. Moreover, few studies assess longer-term effects and there exists relatively little rigorous evidence that compares different interventions. It is therefore strongly recommended to undertake additional research to improve the evidence base as this would allow researchers and policy makers to establish the type of approaches that improve food and nutrition security in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Finally, in order to facilitate this process, there is a need for a clear and uniform definition of food and nutrition security assistance on the one hand as well as agreed upon, comprehensive indicators on the other hand.

TI  - What are the impacts of urban agriculture programs on food security in low and middle-income countries?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Issues of food security and nutrition have wide reaching implications for people and their environments, particularly in low and middle-income countries. One proposed solution is urban agriculture, which has been widely upheld as a solution to the food-crisis facing increasingly metropolitan populations. It is believed to provide the urban poor with food and a source of potential income, whilst improving the urban environment and reducing pressure on finite farmland. Although it faded from many development agendas in the 1990’s, urban agriculture has seen a resurgence since a peak in global food prices in the late 2000’s. There are, however, potential disadvantages to this increasing drive for urban agriculture including associated urban health risks and implications for the environment. The usage of waste-water, for example, may contaminate produced food and intensive irrigation might lead to the spread of malaria and water borne diseases, as well as threatening already limited water supplies. Soil erosion and the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides might also present health risks to urban populations and damage the environment. Despite the potential benefits and harms of urban agriculture, the evidence-base is not well understood. Given the current policy drive to promote urban agriculture, there is an urgent need to understand its effects on urban populations and their environments. This review will seek out, select, appraise and synthesise evidence on the impacts of urban agriculture on food security and nutrition. We will employ systematic review methodology to ensure that our review of the evidence is comprehensive, transparent and replicable. In addition to searching electronic databases, we will examine websites and contact academics, practitioners and policy-makers for relevant research. All potentially relevant literature will be screened against pre-specified criteria and assessed for risk of bias using established critical appraisal tools. This is to ensure that we only include the evidence in which we have confidence. Depending on the nature of the available data, we will then synthesise the available evidence using statistical meta-analysis and/or narrative synthesis. Our findings will be disseminated in a variety of ways to ensure that the evidence is available for policy-makers and practitioners.

            Africa: A scoping review on practices and nutrition outcomes in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya
PY  - 2022
AB  - Home gardening is promoted as an adaptation strategy to ameliorate the increasing food insecurity from climate change impacts among subsistence farming families in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, the geographic distribution of home gardens, their setup, management, and the effects on nutrition outcomes have not been fully described. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize recent evidence on home gardening for two exemplar countries: Burkina Faso and Kenya. Between June and August 2020, we searched, screened, and extracted evidence about home garden projects in both countries, following the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. Peer-reviewed scientific publications, and gray literature in English and French that reported about subsistence horticulture in rural settings of Burkina Faso or Kenya were included. The characteristics of the documents and the data pertaining to our research objectives were extracted into predefined spreadsheets. The data were synthesized in the form of a narrative review. Our search yielded 949 documents, of which 20 documents were included in the synthesis (Burkina Faso: 8, Kenya: 12). While the gardens varied in composition and size, the majority provided green leafy vegetables and indigenous horticultural crops. The challenges for successful home garden implementation comprised unfavorable climatic conditions, access to and affordability of inputs, water and land, and lack of know-how. We identified trends for improved food security, diet quality, and nutritional status among the target populations. This scoping review found that there is limited evidence on home garden practices in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya. To enhance the sustainability of home gardens, research and resources should be invested in codesigning context-specific home gardening projects. Pending rigorous impact evaluation, home gardens appear to be a promising tool for climate change adaptation while simultaneously improving food security and the nutritional situation among women and young children in these two exemplar countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Diet among people in the Terai region of Nepal, an area of micronutrient deficiency.
PY  - 2012
AB  - In the Terai region, despite its ecological richness, the people have long suffered from a deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron and zinc. The aim of this study was to investigate dietary and nutritional intakes among people in the Terai region of Nepal. The results were compared by sex and ethnicity. Food consumption surveys (one-day weighed records) were conducted among 114 people (55 Mushar and 59 Tharu). Nutritional intakes were calculated using Nepali food composition and other tables. The diet in the Terai region was characterized by a large amount of rice consumed with a tiny amount of curry or dal as a side dish. Intakes of vitamin A, iron, riboflavin and selenium were less than 50% of the recommended daily allowance irrespective of ethnicity or sex (with the exception of iron intake among Tharu males). Intakes of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, phosphorus and zinc were higher among the Tharu than the Mushar, while intakes of selenium and iodine were higher among the Mushar than the Tharu. The nutritional significance of these differences was slight. Protein intake (per kg body weight) was lower in females than in males, while the energy-adjusted micronutrient intakes did not differ by sex. Intakes of vitamin A, iron, riboflavin and selenium were deficient among the participants. Intervention projects such as the introduction of kitchen gardens or fish farming may be effective, but will increase the degree of inequality between the two ethnic groups.

TI  - Is agricultural engagement associated with lower incidence or prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular disease risk factors? A systematic review of observational studies from low- and middle-income countries.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes and cancer account for more than half of the global disease burden, and 75% of related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite large regional variations in CVD incidence and prevalence, CVDs remain the leading causes of death worldwide. With urbanisation, developing nations are undergoing unprecedented labour-force transitions out of agriculture and into types of non-agricultural employment, mainly in the industry and service sectors. There are few studies on the effect of these transitions on CVDs and CVD risk factors in LMICs. We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from January 1950 to January 2017 to assess the association of engaging in agriculture compared to types of non-agricultural employment (e.g. services and manufacturing) with CVD incidence, prevalence and risk factors. Studies were included if they: included participants who engaged in agriculture and participants who did not engage in agriculture; measured atherosclerotic CVDs or their modifiable risk factors; and involved adults from LMICs. We assessed the quality of evidence in seven domains of each study. Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and compared in forest plots across studies. Study heterogeneity did not permit formal meta-analyses with pooled results. There was a lack of publications on the primary outcomes, atherosclerotic CVDs (n = 2). Limited evidence of varying consistency from 13 studies in five countries reported that compared with non-agricultural workers, mainly living in urban areas, rural agriculture workers had a lower prevalence of hypertension, overweight and obesity; and a higher prevalence of underweight and smoking. High quality evidence is lacking on the associations of engaging in and transitioning out of agriculture with atherosclerotic CVDs and their modifiable risk factors in LMICs. There is a need for interdisciplinary longitudinal studies to understand associations of types of employment and labour-force transitions with CVD burdens in LMICs.

TI  - Participatory Assessment of Factors Influencing Nutrition and Livelihoods in Rural Ethiopia: Implications for Measuring Impacts of Multisector Nutrition Programs:
PY  - 2017
AB  - Agricultural interventions more effectively improve nutrition when they are adapted to local contexts and engage multiple sectors. However, evidence is limited for how to design and measure the impacts of such interventions. We piloted a participatory methodology to collect community feedback to inform the design and selection of measures for a multisector nutrition intervention in Ethiopia. Study participants were purposively recruited from 6 rural districts in Tigray and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' regions. Qualitative data were collected from 12 focus group discussions with smallholder farmers (men and women) participating in a nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention. The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) combined with an ecological systems model informed the survey tool and analyses. Analyses revealed 3 key findings. First, there were regional differences in how communities defined assets important for nutrition. Second, when asked to prioritize which assets were most important, communities selected every SLA capital category; however, the types of assets within each category differed by region. Third, the most commonly reported barriers to good nutrition were traditional feeding behaviors (eg, men eating before women) and lack of nutrition knowledge. How households use assets to enhance nutrition is influenced by diverse and dynamic cultural, social, economic, and ecological factors. The participatory methods piloted in this study present a novel approach to identify contextually relevant household, community, and institutional assets used to support food and nutrition security.

TI  - Interventions in Agriculture for Nutrition Outcomes: A Systematic Review Focused on South Asia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Research on the potential impact of interventions in agriculture on nutrition outcomes is of particular relevance in South Asia where agriculture-related activities are a major source of livelihoods for large sections of society and where the population suffers from one of the highest global burdens of malnutrition in all its forms. This systematic review aims to assess the strength of the available evidence that agricultural interventions have an impact on intermediate and final nutrition outcomes in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. We searched five literature databases and reference lists of previous systematic reviews to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2017, detailing impacts of household- or farm-level agricultural interventions on nutritional outcomes in South Asia. We identified six intervention studies (reported in nine papers) conducted in Bangladesh (two studies), India (two studies) and Nepal (two studies). The majority of studies examined the impact of provision of seed, plants and training to increase home garden fruit and vegetable production with or without integrated poultry provision and training. Other studies evaluated the impact of livestock or aquaculture provision and training. Study designs and quality were mixed; heterogeneity across studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Interventions had a positive impact on intermediate outcomes on the pathway from agricultural intervention to nutritional or health status including dietary quality and dietary diversity of households and individuals (reported in seven papers). The evidence on the impact on final nutritional outcomes was mixed: one paper reported that home gardens with poultry reduced the odds of anaemia but there was no convincing evidence of an impact of agricultural interventions on child anthropometric measurement (reported in four papers). In recent years, the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research programme consortium has significantly expanded research on agricultural interventions for nutrition outcomes by conducting and commissioning a suite of formative and feasibility studies that have extended both the range and geographic location of interventions under study. This expanding body of research should, in the future, enable the identification of cost-effective interventions to enhance the impact of agricultural interventions sustainably to improve nutrition outcomes especially in women and children in South Asia.

TI  - Agriculture, Food Systems, and Nutrition: Meeting the Challenge.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Malnutrition is a global challenge with huge social and economic costs; nearly every country faces a public health challenge, whether from undernutrition, overweight/obesity, and/or micronutrient deficiencies. Malnutrition is a multisectoral, multi-level problem that results from the complex interplay between household and individual decision-making, agri-food, health, and environmental systems that determine access to services and resources, and related policy processes. This paper reviews the theory and recent qualitative evidence (particularly from 2010 to 2016) in the public health and nutrition literature, on the role that agriculture plays in improving nutrition, how food systems are changing rapidly due to globalization, trade liberalization, and urbanization, and the implications this has for nutrition globally. The paper ends by summarizing recommendations that emerge from this research related to (i) knowledge, evidence, and communications, (ii) politics, governance, and policy, and (iii) capacity, leadership, and financing.

TI  - THE KOMATI DOWNSTREAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES
PY  - 2007
AB  - To overcome widespread rural poverty, raise incomes and improve food security, Swaziland has begun a process of commercialisation of its subsistence farms. This strategy is based upon extending irrigation onto customary tenured land in the semi-arid lowveld and converting land to sugar cane production. The paper demonstrates that if farmers adopt an irrigated home garden as a supplement to the cash crop, then food security may be improved. However, changes to the EU's Sugar Protocol is undermining the financial viability of the participating farmers' associations and compromising the ability of the Komati Downstrean Development Project to improve living standards in the area. It argues that EU aid provided to offset changes to the EU Sugar Protocol should be targeted at the most vulnerable to those changes. © 2007 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG.

TI  - Volunteer Community Health and Agriculture Workers Help Reduce Childhood Malnutrition in Tajikistan.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Childhood malnutrition is a nationally-recognized problem in Tajikistan. In 2017, 6% of children under 5 years were wasted and 18% were stunted. Through the Tajikistan Health and Nutrition Activity (THNA), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Feed the Future, IntraHealth International trained 1,370 volunteer community health workers (CHWs) and 500 community agricultural workers (CAWs) in 500 rural communities to improve nutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. CHWs and CAWs mutually encourage health behavior change, reinforce better agricultural practices, and promote maternal and child health and nutritious diets through household visits, community events, and peer support groups. CHWs refer children with malnutrition and diarrhea and pregnant women who are not registered for antenatal care to health facilities. THNA supported CHWs/CAWs through peer learning, refresher trainings, supportive supervision, and quarterly material incentives. We observed gains in knowledge, attitudes, and practices across health; nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture in target communities. From 2016 to 2019, we observed statistically significant (P<.05) improvements in children receiving a minimum acceptable diet; children with diarrhea receiving more liquids; women making 4 or more antenatal care visits; women reporting improved WASH; and farmers demonstrating improved agricultural practices. A February 2020 screening of 94.6% of children under 5 years in target communities found the prevalence of children with signs of wasting at 2.2%. Partnerships between CHWs, CAWs, and rural health workers facilitated these results. Paired agricultural and health interventions proved successful in improving nutrition of children and may be applicable in other contexts. Although effective in delivering interventions, CHWs/CAWs experience attrition, need motivation, and require intensive support. Assuming responsibility for this community-based volunteer workforce presents a major challenge for Tajikistan's national and local governments.

TI  - Impacts of Agriculture on Nutrition: Nature of the Evidence and Research Gaps:
PY  - 2014
AB  - BackgroundIn the past decade, numerous exercises have been undertaken to document knowledge of the effects of agricultural development projects on human nutrition.ObjectiveThe present paper reviews 10 papers published since 2000 to synthesize current evidence of agriculture-to-nutrition linkages.ResultsAlthough there are differences in focus, methods used, and standards of evidence across the set of papers considered, three common findings emerge. First, the empirical evidence for plausible and significant impacts of agricultural interventions on defined nutrition outcomes remains disappointingly scarce. Second, absence of evidence should not be equated with evidence of no impact. Weaknesses in study design and survey methods are all too common, leading to weak results and limited generalizability. Third, the broad domains of “agriculture' on the one hand, and “nutritional status' on the other, must be unpackaged in future analyses if statistically significant findings and relevant policy or program concl...

TI  - Reconnecting Rural Native Hawaiian Families to Food through Aquaponics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Food insecurity is a pressing issue in Hawai‘i as the vast majority of available and accessible foods are imported. To address this issue, a backyard aquaponics program was implemented from 2010 to 2016 to offer additional avenues to food sovereignty in a rural predominantly Native Hawaiian community. Aquaponics provides a contained and sustainable food production system that models Native Hawaiian principles of land and water stewardship. The purpose of this community-engaged study was to identify the outcomes and resources needed to continue sustaining the backyard aquaponics systems. The researchers began building a relationship with the community by helping to build several aquaponics systems. The researchers and community partner co-developed the interview questions and participants were interviewed in-person. The outcomes of the study revealed multiple benefits of having a backyard aquaponics system, including increased access to vegetables and fruit, improved diet, low maintenance cost, and enhanced family and community connectedness. Participants reported a renewed connection to Native Hawaiian values, especially land stewardship. Challenges included leaks and breakages with the system, overproduction of fish, complications in water temperature, and vulnerability to unpredictable weather. These findings suggest that backyard aquaponics systems have the potential to provide multiple benefits including alleviating barriers related to food security.

TI  - The contribution of community gardens to food security in the Maphephetheni uplands
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although community gardens are widely promoted, very little empirical evidence exists of their contribution to food security. This study evaluated the contribution of community gardens to alleviating food insecurity for 53 community gardeners in Maphephetheni, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, it was found that 89% of these households were anxious about food supplies, consumed insufficient food and were severely food insecure. In addition, 72% consumed poor quality food. Community gardens were unable to solve the problem of food insecurity, but their contribution to consumption cannot be entirely ignored. Improved productivity and appropriate agricultural and nutritional advice are necessary. Land availability needs to be addressed through community and other redress systems to grant communities access to less marginal and more accessible productive land close to water. Programmes to support non-farm income are needed and could provide incentives for increased ...

TI  - Design and participant characteristics of TX sprouts: A school-based cluster randomized gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Aims To outline the study design, outcome measures, protocol and baseline characteristics of enrolled participants of Texas (TX) Sprouts, a one-year school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking cluster randomized trial. Methods Eight schools were randomly assigned to the TX Sprouts intervention and eight schools to the delayed intervention over three years (2016–2019). The intervention arm received: formation/training of Garden Leadership Committees; a 0.25-acre outdoor teaching garden; 18 student lessons including gardening, nutrition, and cooking activities, taught weekly during school hours by hired educators throughout one school year; and nine parent lessons taught monthly to families. The delayed intervention was implemented the following academic year and received the same protocol as the intervention arm. Primary outcomes included: dietary intake, dietary-related behaviors, obesity, and metabolic parameters. Child measures included: height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure, and dietary psychosocial variables. A subsample of children were measured for glucose, hemoglobin-A1C, and 24-hour dietary recalls. Parent measures included: height and weight, dietary intake, and related dietary psychosocial variables. Results Of the 4239 eligible students, 3137 students consented and provided baseline clinical measures; 3132 students completed child surveys, with 92% of their parents completing parent surveys. The subsamples of blood draws and dietary recalls were 34% and 24%, respectively. Intervention arm baseline descriptives, clinical and dietary data for children and parents are reported. Conclusion The TX Sprouts intervention targeted primarily low-income Hispanic children and their parents; utilized an interactive gardening, nutrition, and cooking program; and measured a battery of dietary behaviors, obesity and metabolic outcomes.

TI  - Implementing Perennial Kitchen Garden Model to Improve Diet Diversity in Melghat, India
PY  - 2015
AB  - Lack of diet diversity causing micronutrient deficiency is common in developing countries and is gaining attention due to the hidden consequences of impaired physical and cognitive development. This paper describes the propagation of a sustainable perennial kitchen garden (KG) model to address household (HH) diet diversity in Melghat. Nutrient dense plants, comprising of minimum one tree (perennial) and one green leafy vegetable (GLV) were given to participating HHs along with qualitative interventions. Baseline survey was conducted in winter 2011 followed by seasonal surveys over 2 years to record changes in KG practices, dietary intake and childcare practices. Marked increase from 4% at baseline to 95% at endline was seen in the KG maintainance. Increased diversity was seen in all food categories other than cereals and pulses. Variety of GLVs consumed increased over the two winters as well as the 2 summers. However, no change in the quantity of GLV consumed was noted which was attributed to the duration of the study period being insufficient for the trees to grow and provide adequate leaves for consumption. Notably, livelihood component was not promoted and HHs were encouraged to harvest and distribute excess seeds to relatives and neighbours. The study generated huge demand from HHs within the intervention and neighbouring villages. It concludes that a well designed perennial KG along with imparting adequate knowledge can be a sustainable practice to increase diet diversity and GLV intake which would help address micronutrient deficiencies in the community.

TI  - Critical review of the emerging research evidence on agricultural biodiversity, diet diversity, and nutritional status in low- and middle-income countries.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The declining diversity of agricultural production and food supplies worldwide may have important implications for global diets. The primary objective of this review is to assess the nature and magnitude of the associations of agricultural biodiversity with diet quality and anthropometric outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. A comprehensive review of 5 databases using a priori exclusion criteria and application of a systematic, qualitative analysis to the findings of identified studies revealed that agricultural biodiversity has a small but consistent association with more diverse household- and individual-level diets, although the magnitude of this association varies with the extent of existing diversification of farms. Greater on-farm crop species richness is also associated with small, positive increments in young child linear stature. Agricultural diversification may contribute to diversified diets through both subsistence- and income-generating pathways and may be an important strategy for improving diets and nutrition outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Six research priorities for future studies of the influence of agricultural biodiversity on nutrition outcomes are identified based on gaps in the research literature.

TI  - Prioritizing Nutrition in Agriculture and Rural Development : Guiding Principles for Operational Investments
PY  - 2012
AB  - Agricultural and rural development provides a critically important opportunity for reducing malnutrition. The purpose of this paper is to provide a set of guiding principles for incorporating nutrition goals into the design and implementation of agricultural and rural development projects, and to provide examples of current best evidence options for operational investments. Several principles are likely to be important in all or most cases for nutrition-sensitive agriculture, which can be adapted to individual contexts. These include the following: 1) incorporate nutritional concerns into the design and implementation of agricultural policies, projects, and investments; 2) target nutritionally vulnerable groups; 3) invest in women; 4) increase year-round access to diverse, nutrient-dense foods; 5) protect health through water management; 6) design poverty-reduction strategies explicitly to benefit nutrition; 7) create enabling environments for good nutrition through knowledge and incentives; and 8) seek opportunities to work across sectors. To help assess which actions are most relevant for a specific situation, a set of key questions are included after each broad principle. The paper also highlights areas where agricultural investments may cause harm, and provides options for improving policy coherence. The principles underscore investments in people and systems that have the potential to transform underlying conditions and positively influence the multiple, proximal determinants of proper nutrition. Further research and evaluation priorities include tracking impact on multiple outcomes at once (such as diet, nutritional status, productivity, and income); designing studies that can attribute impact to specific approaches; and collecting information on costs and cost-effectiveness. Although there is a need to strengthen knowledge around design and implementation strategies, there is good evidence that well-planned investments are likely to reach at least targeted income and dietary outcomes. Existing knowledge around the recommended principles is sufficient to move ahead in designing nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions.

TI  - Who is the Woman in Women's Nutrition? A Narrative Review of Evidence and Actions to Support Women's Nutrition throughout Life
PY  - 2019
AB  - Nutrition interventions that target mothers alone inadequately address women's needs across their lives: during adolescence, preconception, and in later years of life. They also fail to capture nulliparous women. The extent to which nutrition interventions effectively reach women throughout the life course is not well documented. In this comprehensive narrative review, we summarized the impact and delivery platforms of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions targeting adolescent girls, women of reproductive age (nonpregnant, nonlactating), pregnant and lactating women, women with young children <5 y, and older women, with a focus on nutrition interventions delivered in low- and middle-income countries. We found that although there were many effective interventions that targeted women's nutrition, they largely targeted women who were pregnant and lactating or with young children. There were major gaps in the targeting of interventions to older women. For the delivery platforms, community-based settings, compared with facility-based settings, more equitably reached women across the life course, including adolescents, women of reproductive age, and older women. Nutrition-sensitive approaches were more often delivered in community-based settings; however, the evidence of their impact on women's nutritional outcomes was less clear. We also found major research and programming gaps relative to targeting overweight, obesity, and noncommunicable disease. We conclude that focused efforts on women during pregnancy and in the first couple of years postpartum fail to address the interrelation and compounding nature of nutritional disadvantages that are perpetuated across many women's lives. In order for policies and interventions to more effectively address inequities faced by women, and not only women as mothers, it is essential that they reflect on how, when, and where to engage with women across the life course.

TI  - Household agricultural activities and child growth: evidence from rural Timor-Leste
PY  - 2017
AB  - Childhood under-nutrition and malnutrition are prevalent in low and middle-income countries. Where it is the primary source of food production, consumption, and cash income, agriculture has a close relationship with health and nutrition in these emerging economies. Although Timor-Leste achieved lower middle-income status in 2011, national economic growth has not delivered anticipated nutritional dividends. Seeking to redress a lack of research that clearly demonstrates how agriculture impacts on nutrition in Timor-Leste, we investigated the links between household agricultural activities and children's physical growth in two agro-ecologically varying field sites: lowland Natarbora and mountainous Ossu. Children in both sites were below World Health Organization standards in height, weight, and body mass index. Coastal children recorded better growth than upland children. Livestock production was linked to poorer growth in the upland, but not coastal communities, which may be linked to specific differences in husbandry practices. In both communities, access to a plantation was somewhat associated with children's (0–10 years) increased weight-for-age. As simple agricultural indicators do not fully explain growth outcomes, a livelihood security approach is proposed to better understand how households address food and nutritional needs in relation to broader livelihood concerns.

TI  - Lupinus mutabilis Sweet, a traditional Ecuadorian grain: Fatty acid composition, use in the Ecuadorian food system, and potential for reducing malnutrition.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Past studies show that in the rural area of the Ecuadorian highlands total fat intake is low and therefore are at risk for deficiency of essential fatty acids (EFAs). The emphasis on the consumption of foods rich in carbohydrates and poor quality fats raises concerns about low intake of fat, especially in children and suggests that the promotion of legumes with high fat can produce health benefits. Lupinus mutabilis Sweet (“lupine”) is a legume grown in Ecuador and throughout the Andes. The improved variety, lNlAP-450, has high yields, high viability, can be grown on marginal soils and is early maturing (six months compared to 12 months of the native varieties). Analyses of its fat content were conducted, and, consistent with previous studies, fat levels were high (22% fat (dry weight)) and of high quality, with essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids comprising over three-quarters of the total fat. A successful lupine promotion program in rural Ecuador was able to increase lupine intakes to achieve 10 to 15% of the recommended EFA intake. Further intervention (with more lupine, processed lupine products, such as oils, or other healthy fat-rich foods) will be required to meet the fat requirements in Andean populations.

TI  - Nutritional Security of Pre-school Children from Irrigators and Non-irrigators Households in Turkana County, Kenya
PY  - 2019
AB  - Turkana County is a region of soils of high agricultural potential but aridity hinders its exploitation. It is characterized by scarce, erratic rainfall patterns. Food security remains a challenge in Turkana County despite its potential. Malnutrition resulting from food insecurity is the major concern in Turkana County. Turkana County prevalence of global acute malnutrition has remained high above the World Health Organization (WHO) threshold that is 27.3%. The study was guided by sustainable development goals, the goal number two which talks about end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable development and goal number three which talks about ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Malnutrition has been and continues to be responsible for over 60% of child mortality and therefore reduction of malnutrition is one of key ways of reducing child mortality. The current study investigated the contribution of small-scale irrigation interventions on nutrition status of pre-school children in Turkana County. Study objectives were; to evaluate nutrition status of pre-school children using anthropometry measurements among households practicing irrigation and those not practicing and establish the relationship. Cross-sectional, comparative and evaluation designs were used. Purposive and cluster sampling was done. Sample size was 420 (210 households practicing irrigation and 210 not practicing). A total of 845 children below 5 years were studied. The nutrition status of the pre-school children was poor across households practicing irrigation and those not practicing irrigation. The Chi square test of independence on the weight for age status for children below five years gave X 2 2, 0.05 = 90.439. This shows that there was highly significant (p<0.01) association between the weight for age for children below five years and the irrigation status of the household. A test of deviation to analyze weight for age for children below five years across households doing irrigation indicated that there was significant (p<0.05) difference with X 2 1, 0.05 = 9.167. The Chi square test of independence on the prevalence of weight for height for children below five years gave X 2 3, 0.05 = 21.798. This shows that there was significant (p<0.05) association between the weight for height for children below five years and the irrigation status of the household. Non-food strategies may be needed to complement dietary practices to manage the malnutrition situation in Turkana County

TI  - Leveraging agriculture for nutrition in South Asia: What do we know, and what have we learned?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Despite significant improvements over recent decades, rates of undernutrition remain high in South Asia, with adverse impacts on morbidity and mortality. Overweight/obesity, among children and adults, is now an additional and major public health concern. While agriculture has the potential to improve nutrition through several pathways, this potential is currently not being realised in the region. The Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research consortium (2012–2018) set out to improve understanding about how agriculture and related food policies and programs in South Asia (specifically in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan) can be better conceptualised and implemented in order to enhance impacts on nutrition outcomes, especially those of young children and adolescent girls. This paper provides a snapshot of the agriculture-nutrition nexus in the region, outlines the pathways through which agriculture can influence nutrition outcomes, elaborates on the objectives of the LANSA research consortium within this context, and highlights the core findings of the six papers that form the body of this Special Issue. The paper ends with five key lessons that have emerged from this research, during this decade.

TI  - Participatory, agroecological and gender-sensitive approaches to improved nutrition : a case study in Malawi
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper examines a participatory agriculture and nutrition program in northern Malawi that successfully improved child growth, crop diversity, food security through innovative educational strategies and sustainable agriculture. Malawi is a relevant case study, as a low-income country where the majority of people are rural smallholder farmers, and over the last decade the government has pursued an agricultural input subsidy program, with conflicting results. Persistent food insecurity and heavy reliance on maize as a food source in Malawi has multidimensional impacts on families, including low dietary diversity and child undernutrition. Women’s agency and access to agricultural resources is very limited in Malawi, with early marriage associated with low dietary diversity, early pregnancy and high spousal violence for women. Rural Malawian women have less access to education, lower access to land, credit, seeds and other agricultural resources compared to men. In addition they are constrained by highly unequal workloads, including agricultural labor, household tasks and child care responsibilities. Understanding ways to improve child nutrition while at the same time empowering marginalized smallscale farmers to innovate provides lessons that Malawi can share with other rural communities in Africa. The authors and collaborating researchers have been conducting this research for over 12 years, and demonstrate that increased knowledge of agroecological methods, farmer-to-farmer teaching, directly addressing unequal social relations and integration of child nutrition and local knowledge are all key factors in improving livelihoods, and employed as they were in this long-term research make this project an exception to conventional agriculture-based interventions. Proven food security and nutritional gains have been achieved through agricultural education that was fully integrated with nutrition, and was focused on farmers, including women farmers and vulnerable members of the communities. The iterative, dialogue-based and farmer-led approaches used mobilized communities to apply agroecological methods and improved child feeding practices, as well as address unequal gender relations. Significant improvements in child growth (average of 0.6 improvement in weight-for-age Z score over time and compared to non-project households) and household food security resulted from participatory experimentation with crop diversification, legume intercropping and nutrition education. Farmer practices have improved markedly, including improved residue management and incorporation of nutrient-rich legumes into maize-based cropping, up from 15% in 2000 to over 70% of farmers in 2011. More recent efforts by the project have focused on participatory climate change adaptation and addressing the specific needs of HIV/AIDS-affected rural households. Four hundred smallholder farmers, selected based on known vulnerability (i.e. highly food insecure, HIV/AIDS affected and/or youth) are doing participatory climate change adaptation research in two regions in Malawi, including crop diversification, agroforestry and small livestock integration. Initial findings from this initiative will be discussed. The paper will examine the evidence of the case study, and draw out key strategies to promote healthy diets, empower the socially disadvantaged and address gender issues using food and agriculture-based approaches. Other related case studies will be discussed in relation to this study. Broader relevance in relation to vulnerable regions to climate change impacts and other shocks will be discussed in light of current research.

TI  - Identifying Potential Programs and Platforms to Deliver Multiple Micronutrient Interventions
PY  - 2011
AB  - This article reviews the potential of four broad types of platforms, health, agriculture, market-based, and social protection programs, to deliver multiple micronutrient (MMN) interventions (supplementation, fortification, and dietary modification). We assessed the platforms’ potential based on seven performance criteria related to programs within these platforms: 1) targeting, 2) efficacy of interventions, 3) quality of implementation, 4) utilization, 5) impact, 6) coverage, and 7) sustainability. We highlight one type of program per platform to illustrate strengths and weaknesses for delivering MMN interventions, identify critical knowledge gaps, and highlight what is needed to increase effectiveness for delivering MMN interventions. We found that all four platforms have the potential to effectively deliver MMN interventions if the following key program elements are addressed: 1) strong behavior change communication strategies to increase demand and proper utilization of services/products; 2) supply side interventions to ensure consistent availability of high quality interventions, products, and well-trained staff; 3) rigorous evaluations of effectiveness, quality of delivery, and impact pathways to generate best practices for replication and scale-up; and 4 )t imely dissemination of evaluation results to ensure use by program implementers and policy makers. The diversification of delivery platforms, which simultaneously addresses multiple determinants of MMN deficiencies and expands coverage, is needed to accelerate progress in reducing MMN deficiencies.

TI  - Effects of a participatory agriculture and nutrition education project on child growth in northern Malawi.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether children in households involved in a participatory agriculture and nutrition intervention had improved growth compared to children in matched comparable households and whether the level of involvement and length of time in the project had an effect on child growth. Design: A prospective quasi-experimental study comparing baseline and followup data in ‘intervention’ villages with matched subjects in ‘comparison’ villages. Mixed model analyses were conducted on standardized child growth scores (weight- and height-for-age Z-scores), controlling for child age and testing for effects of length of time and intensity of village involvement in the intervention. Setting: A participatory agriculture and nutrition project (the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC) project) was initiated by Ekwendeni Hospital aimed at improving child nutritional status with smallholder farmers in a rural area in northern Malawi. Agricultural interventions involved intercropping legumes and visits from farmer researchers, while nutrition education involved home visits and group meetings. Subjects: Participants in intervention villages were self-selected, and control participants were matched by age and household food security status of the child. Over a 6-year period, nine surveys were conducted, taking 3838 height and weight measures of children under the age of 3 years. Results: There was an improvement over initial conditions of up to 0?6 in weightfor-age Z-score (WAZ; from 20? 4( SD 0?5) to 0? 3( SD 0?4)) for children in the longest involved villages, and an improvement over initial conditions of 0? 8i n WAZ for children in the most intensely involved villages (from 20? 6( SD 0?4) to 0?2 (SD 0?4)). Conclusions: Long-term efforts to improve child nutrition through participatory agricultural interventions had a significant effect on child growth.

TI  - Duration of programme exposure is associated with improved outcomes in nutrition and health: the case for longer project cycles from intervention experience in rural Nepal
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACTEconomic growth and poverty reduction are not always sufficient to improve child health and nutritional status. Heifer International promotes livestock introduction and related training for community development and poverty alleviation. These programmes do not directly address child health or nutrition. To determine effects of its activities on these important outcomes, Heifer conducted a 4-year longitudinal investigation in rural Nepal. The intervention was associated with significantly improved child anthropometry (related to the duration of intervention exposure) and child health. Heifer activities represent a viable ‘nutrition sensitive’ intervention, but these impacts take time to manifest and be sustained.

TI  - Achieving Food and Nutrition Security and Climate Change: Clash of the Titans or Alignment of the Stars?
PY  - 2020
AB  - In order to meet the demands of the world’s growing population, food production needs to increase by almost 60%, yet this is in the face of increasing global malnutrition, land scarcity, extreme weather events and rainfall pattern shifts. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) of ‘zero hunger’ requires a multifaceted approach which maximises synergism with climate change goals and minimises trade-offs. This approach requires transformative shifts in gender equality, education, research focus, technological development, market chains and agricultural practices. However, aspects of such transformative approaches can be in opposition to cultural beliefs, create household debt, increase labour requirements and place pressure on local resources. For enhanced SDG 2 and climate change outcomes, such trade-offs should be understood and minimised. Zero hunger is achieved by ensuring not just food security but also nutrition security for all people. Unfortunately, it is inevitable that some targets on achieving sustainable development goals, such as SDG 2 ‘zero hunger’, may benefit some countries or regions yet will undermine the ability for others to reach climate change goals. This chapter explores the synergisms and trade-offs between climate change goals and achieving zero hunger through food and nutrition security. Indicators for SDG 2 will be used to highlight synergies and trade-offs with climate change goals. These examples demonstrate the need for policy design to be contextual, respond to regional needs and allow individuals and communities to understand, prepare for and adjust their agricultural and social systems to support the diversifying of household income. Whilst this chapter primarily explores synergies and trade-offs, some considerations are suggested for future policy development and decision-makers.

TI  - Process evaluation improves delivery of a nutrition‐sensitive agriculture programme in Burkina Faso
PY  - 2017
AB  - Evidence is emerging from rigorous evaluations about the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes in improving nutritional outcomes. Additional evidence can elucidate how different programme components and pathways contribute and can be optimized for impact. The International Food Policy Research Institute, with Helen Keller International, designed a comprehensive framework to evaluate the delivery, utilization, and impact of Helen Keller International's enhanced homestead food production programme in Burkina Faso. After 18 months of implementation, a process evaluation was conducted to examine programme impact pathways, using key informant and semistructured interviews with implementing agents and beneficiaries, and with residents of control communities. Data were analyzed by International Food Policy Research Institute and reviewed with project managers and partners through multiple workshops to identify opportunities to strengthen implementation. Findings illuminated gaps between intended and actual delivery schemes, including input constraints, knowledge gaps among community agents in agriculture and young child nutrition practices, and lower than expected activity by community volunteers. In response, staff developed measures to overcome water constraints and expand vegetable and poultry production, retrained volunteers in certain techniques of food production and counselling for nutrition behaviour change, added small incentives to motivate volunteers, and shaped both immediate and long-term changes to the programme model. Working closely with International Food Policy Research Institute on the evaluation activities also expanded the repertoire of research methods and skills of Helen Keller International staff. Process evaluation can strengthen programme delivery, utilization, and design. Collaboration between researchers and implementers can improve programme effectiveness, project staff capacity, and advance delivery science.

TI  - Grain legume cultivation and children’s dietary diversity in smallholder farming households in rural Ghana and Kenya
PY  - 2017
AB  - Boosting smallholder food production can potentially improve children’s nutrition in rural Sub-Saharan Africa through a production-own consumption pathway and an income-food purchase pathway. Rigorously designed studies are needed to provide evidence for nutrition impact, but are often difficult to implement in agricultural projects. Within the framework of a large agricultural development project supporting legume production (N2Africa), we studied the potential to improve children’s dietary diversity by comparing N2Africa and non-N2Africa households in a cross-sectional quasi-experimental design, followed by structural equation modelling (SEM) and focus group discussions in rural Ghana and Kenya. Comparing N2Africa and non-N2Africa households, we found that participating in N2Africa was not associated with improved dietary diversity of children. However, for soybean, SEM indicated a relatively good fit to the posteriori model in Kenya but not in Ghana, and in Kenya only the production-own consumption pathway was fully supported, with no effect through the income-food purchase pathway. Results are possibly related to differences in the food environment between the two countries, related to attribution of positive characteristics to soybean, the variety of local soybean-based dishes, being a new crop or not, women’s involvement in soybean cultivation, the presence of markets, and being treated as a food or cash crop. These findings confirm the importance of the food environment for translation of enhanced crop production into improved human nutrition. This study also shows that in a situation where rigorous study designs cannot be implemented, SEM is a useful option to analyse whether agriculture projects have the potential to improve nutrition.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives: To explore impacts of a demonstration garden-based agricultural intervention on agricultural knowledge, practices and production, food security and preschool child diet diversity of subsistence farming households. Design: Observational study of households new to the intervention or participating for 1 or 5 years. Variables measured were agricultural techniques learned from the intervention and used, agricultural production, household food insecurity (FIS) and child diet diversity (DDS), over one agricultural cycle (during land preparation, growing and harvest months). Setting: Fifteen rural subsistence farming communities in Panama. Participants: Households participating in intervention (n 237) with minimum one preschool child. Results: After 1 year, participants had more learned and applied techniques, more staple crops produced and lower FIS and higher DDS during land preparation and growing months compared with those new to the intervention. After 5 years, participants grew more maize, chickens and types of crops and had higher DDS during growing months and, where demonstration gardens persisted, used more learned techniques and children ate more vitamin A-rich foods. Variables associated with DDS varied seasonally: during land preparation, higher DDS was associated with higher household durable asset-based wealth; during growing months, with greater diversity of vegetables planted and lower FIS; during harvest, with older caregivers, caregivers working less in agriculture, more diverse crops and receiving food from demonstration gardens. Conclusions: The intervention improved food production, food security and diets. Sustained demonstration gardens were important for continued use of new agricultural techniques and improved diets.

TI  - The food security system: A new conceptual framework
PY  - 2015
AB  - Public agricultural extension systems often fail due to inadequate consultation of farmers about their information needs and poor understanding of their information search strategies. In discussing and implementing extension programs and advisory services, the following questions need to be addressed: What information do the farmers need? How and where do they search for information? What factors determine their search behavior? How much are they willing to pay for information? While the first two questions are addressed fairly well in the literature, the latter two have not yet been dealt with in the context of developing countries. Using a case study of two districts in South India, we examine farmers’ information needs and information search behavior, factors affecting their search behavior, and their willingness to pay for information. Cluster analysis on access, frequency, and use of information sources identified four farmer information search behaviors—high, medium, semi-medium, and low. The groups differed significantly by post–high school studies, household economic status, cultivated land area, agricultural income, and membership in a farmer-based organization (FBO) and a primary agricultural cooperative bank (PACB). We use these four information search behavior clusters to examine differences in information needs, sources used, and preferred sources. The important information needs relating to rice included pest and disease management, pesticide and fertilizer application, seed variety, and seed treatment. Rice production practices and credit information were more important for the low search group. Private input dealers and the state department of agricultural extension staff were the main information sources, though use of these two sources decreased with greater information searching. High and medium searchers used a greater number of sources, which also included print media and television. The major constraints to information access, common to all search groups, were poor reliability and timeliness. The preferred medium for obtaining information was interpersonal contacts, followed by information via mobile phones, where a helpline or voice messages were preferred over short message service (SMS). A contingent valuation technique revealed that farmers’ willingness to pay for voice-based mobile phone messages was low. The results show that tailoring the delivery of agricultural information to the different information search behaviors of farmers is important for extension programs to consider.

TI  - The Application of Sustainability Assessment: A Community Garden Assessment tool
PY  - 2010
AB  - Community gardens provide numerous benefits, are important to sustain, and are significant to public health. They go beyond tangible benefits such as improved food security, nutrition and physical activity and can be the host of intangible benefits such as improved leadership, social networks, and quality of life. The essence of a community garden's dynamic transcends across multiple intervention levels making the community garden a flexible initiative. However, recent evidence indicates that community gardens struggle with discontinuation. The overarching goal of this paper is to examine longevity and sustainability issues as they relate to community gardens. I will apply a systematic framework of organizational structure and improvement (Sustainability Assessment Modeling (SAM)) to better understand community garden sustainability. Specifically, I propose the use of the SAM framework to develop a community garden assessment. SAM quantifies stakeholder's values, perceptions, and both economic and environmental costs. One aim of this paper is to explore the literature related to SAM and how this model can relate to public health, with a discussion of its methods, strengths, and limitations. The ultimate objective is to synthesize this information into a proposal of an effective, sustainable-focused assessment for community gardens. The participatory assessment process I propose will utilize indicators of organizational strengths, weaknesses and success of community gardens, such as longevity.

TI  - Conceptual Links between Landscape Diversity and Diet Diversity: A Roadmap for Transdisciplinary Research.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Malnutrition linked to poor quality diets affects at least 2 billion people. Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are key sources of dietary diversity in rural settings. In the present article, we develop conceptual links between diet diversity and forested landscape mosaics within the rural tropics. First, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests, trees, and agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in bolstering dietary diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build a framework illuminating four pathways (direct, agroecological, energy, and market pathways) connecting forested landscapes to diet diversity. Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining knowledge gaps related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly simplistic views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional synergies with forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - Combatting Vitamin A deficiency: overcoming obstacles to optimize the food-based approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - Food-based approaches to combat vitamin A deficiency (VAD) continue to be largely ignored by governments and donor agencies. This review deals with common misperceptions as well as constraints that may lay behind this reality. First, high-dose vitamin A capsules provided to preschool age children are no solution for VAD. Second, researchers may assume that it is not possible to standardize foods adequately to study their efficacy in controlled trials. This review summarizes the results of 57 such trials, providing an overview that may assist researchers in making decisions on target groups to study, types of food supplements to provide, quantities, supplementation periods, impacts that are realistic to expect, and sample sizes. Even more complex is to design efficacy trials or impact evaluations of interventions. Again, the paper reviews 40 such trials, providing summary information on approaches, target groups, sample sizes, periods of intervention, and impacts measured using a variety of indicators. There are a number of barriers or constraints that must be planned for and overcome if food-based approaches are to work. This paper reviews several of the most important ones, briefly touching on many of the most effective ways that have been found to overcome them. Food-based approaches can reach all members of the community, are safe for pregnant women, tend to be at least partially sustainable, and confer a wide range of nutritional and other benefits in addition to improving vitamin A status. Food-based approaches are sometimes described as expensive, but this is based on a narrow view. For example, biofortification and dissemination of sweet potatoes cost $9 to $30 per disability-life-year (DALY) gained, while that from VAS was estimated at the estimated cost effectiveness of VAS is $73 per DALY gained. From the community point of view, the economic benefits of food based approaches are likely to subsidize or outweigh their costs.

TI  - Making sense of agrobiodiversity, diet, and intensification of smallholder family farming in the Highland Andes of Ecuador.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Methods are needed for helping researchers and farmers to interactively describe and analyze local practices in search of opportunities for improving health, environment, and economy. The authors worked with smallholder family farmers in five Andean villages in Ecuador to apply participatory four-cell analysis (PFCA) in characterizing agrobiodiversity. Margelef and Shannon indices examined ecological richness and evenness, and a simplified 24-hour dietary recall characterized food consumption. Cross-analysis tested interactions among agrobiodiversity, farm size, and diet. Overall trends appeared to work against sustainable intensification, with notable heterogeneity and positive deviance found in the practices of relatively smaller enterprises, representing a potential resource for sustainable intensification. The suite of methods was determined useful for initiating researcher-farmer explorations of promising innovation pathways.

TI  - Do agricultural support and cash transfer programmes improve nutritional status
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cash transfer and agricultural support programmes are both used to improve nutrition outcomes in developing countries. Previous reviews of these programmes have examined their ability to improve both food consumption and anthropometric outcomes, but none has compared the evidence between the two. We update previous reviews, more than doubling the number of studies on each programme type based on an additional literature search of over 13,000 articles in eight databases. We find: (i) although there are about the same number of programmes of each type, many more papers have been written about the cash transfer programmes than the agricultural programmes; (ii) both programme types improved the quality of food consumption though evidence on quantity is more mixed; and (iii) both programme types show weak evidence of improvements in anthropometric outcomes.

TI  - Gender, Social Equity and Innovations in Smallholder Farming Systems: Pitfalls and Pathways
PY  - 2016
AB  - Development processes, economic growth and agricultural modernization affect women and men in different ways and have not been gender neutral. Women are highly involved in agriculture, but their contribution tends to be undervalued and overseen. Sustainable agricultural innovations may include trade-offs and negative side-effects for women and men, or different social groups, depending on the intervention type and local context. Promising solutions are often technology-focused and not necessarily developed with consideration of gender and social disparity aspects. This paper presents cases of gender and social equity trade-offs related to the promotion and diffusion of improved technologies for agricultural development.The analysis is followed by a discussion of opportunities and pathways for mitigating potential trade-offs.

TI  - The short- and long-term effects of development projects:evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper examines the short-term and long-term impact of development projects on recipients’ wellbeing in Ethiopia. Specifically, it compares the effects of five types of development projects – unconditional and conditional direct transfers, agricultural and social-infrastructure knowledge transfers, and credit projects – on children’s nutrition and on household consumption and income levels. The main finding is that knowledge transfers have the largest positive impact on children’s nutritional status and household consumption, in both the short and the long term. The impact of direct transfers on children’s health is also positive but less significant whereas the effect of credit projects is here undetectable.

TI  - Impact of permagarden intervention on improving fruit and vegetable intake among vulnerable groups. A quasi-experimental study conducted in seven cities of Ethiopia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: Increasing nutrient intake through home gardening is a sustainable strategy that can address multiple micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries. This study investigated the impact of permagarden intervention in increasing the frequency and diversity of vegetable and fruit consumption among vulnerable families. Method: A quasi-experimental study was conducted from August 10 to September 30, 2015. A total of 884 care givers (427 from intervention and 457 control) participated in the study. Data was collected through face to face interview with caregivers of highly vulnerable children. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted using STATA software, and the program impact on the frequency and diversity of household's vegetable consumption between intervention and control groups was assessed using chi square test. Result: Intervention participants had a 13% greater increase frequency of one-week vegetables and fruits consumption compared with control participants (p<0.01). The diversity (consumption of 2 and more groups of vegetable and fruit) is higher among intervention groups than control groups (percentage difference=9, p-value<0.05). A significant higher percentage of participants in the intervention group reported getting the one-week vegetable and fruits mainly from their own garden (percentage difference 58.3, p<0.05). A significantly larger proportion of participants in the intervention group compared to the control group reported "high likelihood" on intention to grow vegetable in the future (percentage difference = 30%, and P<0.01). Perceived importance to include vegetables in every day meal is higher among intervention groups than control groups (percentage difference = 11.5%, P<0.01). Conclusions: The observed higher frequency and diversity of household vegetable consumption among intervention group compared to control group suggests that nutrition and health programs need to promote household vegetable gardening as the means for address improve micro nutrient intake for vulnerable societies in least and middle developed countries.

TI  - Type and extent of trans-disciplinary co-operation to improve food security, health and household environment in low and middle income countries: systematic review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Although linkages have been found between agricultural interventions and nutritional health, and the development of clean fuels and improved solid fuel stoves in reducing household air pollution and adverse health effects, the extent of the potential of combined household interventions to improve health, nutrition and the environment has not been investigated. A systematic review was conducted to identify the extent and type of community-based agricultural and household interventions aimed at improving food security, health and the household environment in low and middle income countries. A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was performed. Key search words were generated reflecting the “participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design” approach and a comprehensive search strategy was developed following “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” recommendations. Any community-based agricultural and/or household interventions were eligible for inclusion if the focus was to improve at least one of the outcome measures of interest. All relevant study designs employing any of these interventions (alone/in combination) were included if conducted in Low and middle income countries. Review articles, and clinical and occupational studies were excluded. A total of 123 studies were included and grouped into four intervention domains; agricultural (n = 27), air quality (n = 34), water quality (n = 32), and nutritional (n = 30). Most studies were conducted in Asia (39.2 %) or Africa (34.6 %) with the remaining 26.1 % in Latin America. Very few studies (n = 11) combined interventions across more than one domain. The majority of agricultural and nutritional studies were conducted in Africa and Asia, whereas the majority of interventions to improve household air quality were conducted in Latin America. It is clear that very little trans-disciplinary research has been done with the majority of studies still being discipline specific. It also appears that certain low and middle income countries seem to focus on domain-specific interventions. The review emphasizes the need to develop holistic, cross-domain intervention packages. Further investigation of the data is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of these interventions and whether interdisciplinary interventions provide greater benefit than those that address single health or community problems.

TI  - Crop abiotic stresses and nutrition of harvested food crops: A Review of impacts, interventions and their effectiveness
PY  - 2019
AB  - In tandem with the accelerating effects of climate change, efforts to increase agricultural productivity to feed the growing population are still being extensively rolled out in Africa. That notwithstanding, a large population in the continent remains food and nutrition insecure; rendering malnutrition the biggest public health challenge. Coupled with the increased incidences of abiotic stresses, developing countries are particularly in dire need to seek options that will sustain both yield and nutritional value of their food crops. Presently, nutritional quality deserves more attention than yield alone, hence factors perturbing it are of an immense importance. While the effects of abiotic stresses on agricultural productivity are unequivocal, their influence on nutritional quality of food crops is still hazy. In the simplest presentation of the synergy between humans, plants and the environment; man gets nutrients from plants, which source nutrients from the soil (environment). We hypothesized that abiotic factors are a double-edged sword with unclear plausible consequences on nutritional status of food crops and consequently humans. In a multifaceted approach, this review concisely presents an overview of malnutrition in Africa, intimate synergy between agriculture and nutrition, and unravels the effects of abiotic stresses on the nutrition status of harvested crops. While the effects are dynamic under many factors, the present work uncovers that abiotic stresses predominantly increase antioxidants, proteins and carbohydrates due to their contributory role in abiotic stress tolerance. It further acknowledges the promising interventions that have been implemented in this light, but in order to impact significantly on human nutrition, we call for a more collaborative approach cognizant of the complexity of this phenomenon. Key words: Abiotic stresses, nutrition, agriculture, antioxidants, climate change, breeding.

TI  - Dairy intensification, mothers and children: an exploration of infant and young child feeding practices among rural dairy farmers in Kenya
PY  - 2013
AB  - Agricultural strategies such as dairy intensification have potential to improve human nutrition through increased household food security. Increasing dairy productivity could also adversely affect infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices because of increased maternal stress, demands on maternal time, and beliefs about the timing and appropriate types of complementary foods. Yet, few studies have looked rigorously at how interventions can affect young children (0-60 months). The study explores, within the context of rural dairy farming in Kenya, the relationship between level of household dairy production and selected IYCF practices using a mixed-methods approach. Six focus group discussions with women involved in dairy farming investigated their attitudes towards breastfeeding, introduction of complementary foods and child diets. Ninety-two households involved in three levels of dairy production with at least one child 0-60 months participated in a household survey. Quantitative results indicated that women from higher dairy producing households were more likely to introduce cow's milk to infants before they reached 6 months than women from households not producing any dairy. Themes from the focus group discussions demonstrated that women were familiar with exclusive breastfeeding recommendations, but indicated a preference for mixed feeding of infants. Evidence from this study can inform nutrition education programmes targeted to farmers participating in dairy interventions in rural, low-income settings to minimise potential harm to the nutritional status of children.

TI  - To sell or consume? Gendered household decision-making on crop production, consumption, and sale in Malawi
PY  - 2020
AB  - Value chains and agricultural commercialization are increasingly being promoted as mechanisms for agricultural transformation, inclusive growth, and—more recently—improving food security and diets. Donors and implementers promote production of nutritious crops as a mechanism for improving the quality and diversity of diets of the rural poor. However, while there is a theoretical basis for this, there is a need for a deeper empirical understanding of how, under what circumstances, and through what pathways own-production of nutritious foods improves diets. This study examines the sociocultural drivers of gendered household decisions to produce and sell or consume nutritious crops, based on analysis of 80 in-depth interviews with women and men in three regions of Malawi. Respondents define all food crops as nutritious and marketable and emphasize maize-security over other more nutrient-dense food crops. The findings provide an in-depth understanding of diet patterns and preferences in the study population. It becomes clear that a sophisticated evaluation procedure guides household production, sale, and consumption decisions wherein a wide range of criteria are considered. In addition, insights emerge on the role of gendered structural domains in these decisions, dismissing a clear dichotomy of men’s crops and women’s crops and supporting a more nuanced and diverse view of these domains.

TI  - Composition of Household Income and Child Nutrition Outcomes Evidence from Uganda.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Summary This study targets the empirical space between cross-country analyses exploring links between income and nutrition without insights on micro-level determinants, and relevant microeconomic studies hindered by small sample size and/or incomplete data. We use the rural samples of the three waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, and estimate panel regressions of child height-for-age z -scores (HAZ) controlling for time-invariant child-level heterogeneity. On the whole, we find no impact of short-term changes in total gross income on HAZ but document small positive correlations for younger children. Sector-differentiated analyses indicate that compared to wage earnings, only share of income from non-farm self-employment correlates positively with HAZ. Within agriculture, shares of income from consumption of own crop production and from low-protein crop production underlie the negative effect of share of income from crop production. While we cannot claim causal relationships, our findings suggest the possibility of “stickiness” of crop production to own consumption.

TI  - Can interventions to promote animal production ameliorate undernutrition
PY  - 2007
AB  - The potential of animal-source foods (ASF) to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies is well recognized. How the intake of ASF can be effectively increased is not known, but promoting animal production (AP) is one possible method. We reviewed the impact of interventions promoting AP on nutritional status and on 6 nutrition-related outcomes: production, household income and expenditure, caregiver income, caregiver time and workload, zoonosis, and dietary intake. Information about the effects on each of the possible outcomes is needed to be able to weigh trade-offs in the potential benefits and costs of promoting AP. The majority of the 14 identified studies found a positive effect of the promotion of AP on production. All studies evaluating the impact on household income or expenditure reported a positive effect on these outcomes. Evidence regarding impact on caregiver income and on caregiver time and workload is too limited to draw any conclusions. We found no studies that examined the impact of the promotion of AP on zoonosis. The studies generally reported a positive impact on dietary intake. Only 4 studies evaluated the impact on nutritional status and found a positive effect. It is unclear whether the improvements in dietary intake and nutritional status were a direct effect of increased production or an indirect effect of increased income. Future studies on the AP-nutrition link would benefit from stronger methodological designs. Available evidence is insufficient to answer whether the promotion of AP is an effective means to alleviate undernutrition.

TI  - Agricultural research for nutrition outcomes – rethinking the agenda
PY  - 2015
AB  - Agriculture and food are assumed to be critical de- terminants of stunting and micronutrient deficiency. However, agriculture research for development has not translated as ex- pected into better nutrition outcomes. We argue that to do so, agriculture research needs to be fundamentally changed, from the current emphasis on supply-side production and productiv- ity goals to understanding consumption and addressing factors that can improve diet quality. Some of the research will be to improve the efficiency of supply for more nutritious foods. Other research will need to focus on factors that promote diet quality rather than focus on food security goals through stocks of staple cereals. Because of its importance in low-income, high-burden countries, agriculture can also contribute more ef- fectively to multisectoral nutrition-sensitive development strat- egies and programs. Critical roles for agricultural research in multisectoral actions will be better metrics, indicators and re- search studies for diet quality and better evaluation methods - both randomized trials for specific interventions and contribu- tion analysis through theories of change for more complex multisectoral system interventions to prevent stunting and mi- cronutrient deficiencies. To achieve improvements in nutrition outcomes at scale, researchers must engage in new partner- ships. In food systems, these partnerships must include more disciplines from agriculture and food science through econom- ics and social science to business and delivery science. Food system researchers will also need to engage more with value chain actors and policy makers. Current efforts to improve nu- trition outcomes at scale are severely hampered by data and evidence gaps that prevent better decisions and faster learning.

TI  - Contextualising complementary feeding in a broader framework for stunting prevention
PY  - 2013
AB  - An estimated 165 million children are stunted due to the combined effects of poor nutrition, repeated infection and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. The complementary feeding period, generally corresponding to age 6-24 months, represents an important period of sensitivity to stunting with lifelong, possibly irrevocable consequences. Interventions to improve complementary feeding practices or the nutritional quality of complementary foods must take into consideration the contextual as well as proximal determinants of stunting. This review presents a conceptual framework that highlights the role of complementary feeding within the layers of contextual and causal factors that lead to stunted growth and development and the resulting short- and long-term consequences. Contextual factors are organized into the following groups: political economy; health and health care systems; education; society and culture; agriculture and food systems; and water, sanitation and environment. We argue that these community and societal conditions underlie infant and young child feeding practices, which are a central pillar to healthy growth and development, and can serve to either impede or enable progress. Effectiveness studies with a strong process evaluation component are needed to identify transdisciplinary solutions. Programme and policy interventions aimed at preventing stunting should be informed by careful assessment of these factors at all levels.

TI  - Teaching approaches and strategies that promote healthy eating in primary school children: a systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Healthy eating by primary school-aged children is important for good health and development. Schools can play an important role in the education and promotion of healthy eating among children. The aim of this review was to: 1) perform a systematic review of randomised controlled, quasi-experimental and cluster controlled trials examining the school-based teaching interventions that improve the eating habits of primary school children; and 2) perform a meta-analysis to determine the effect of those interventions. The systematic review was limited to four healthy eating outcomes: reduced food consumption or energy intake; increased fruit and vegetable consumption or preference; reduced sugar consumption or preference (not from whole fruit); increased nutritional knowledge. In March 2014, we searched seven electronic databases using predefined keywords for intervention studies that were conducted in primary schools which focused on the four healthy eating outcomes. Targeted internet searching using Google Scholar was also used. In excess of 200,000 possible citations were identified. Abstracts and full text of articles of potentially relevant papers were screened to determine eligibility. Data pertaining to teaching strategies that reported on healthy eating outcomes for primary school children was extracted from the 49 eligible papers. Experiential learning strategies were associated with the largest effects across the reduced food consumption or energy intake; increased fruit and vegetable consumption or preference; and increased nutritional knowledge outcomes. Reducing sugar consumption and preference was most influenced by cross-curricular approaches embedded in the interventions. As with most educational interventions, most of the teaching strategies extracted from the intervention studies led to positive changes in primary school children’s healthy eating behaviours. However, given the finite resources, increased overcrowding of school curriculum and capacity of teachers in primary schools, a meta-analysis of this scope is able to provide stakeholders with the best evidence of where these resources should be focused.

TI  - Maternal and Child Nutrition 3 Nutrition-sensitive interventions and programmes: how can they help to accelerate progress in improving maternal and child nutrition?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Acceleration of progress in nutrition will require eff ective, large-scale nutrition-sensitive programmes that address key underlying determinants of nutrition and enhance the coverage and eff ectiveness of nutrition-specifi c interventions. We reviewed evidence of nutritional eff ects of programmes in four sectors—agriculture, social safety nets, early child development, and schooling. The need for investments to boost agricultural production, keep prices low, and increase incomes is undisputable; targeted agricultural programmes can complement these investments by supporting livelihoods, enhancing access to diverse diets in poor populations, and fostering women’s empowerment. However, evidence of the nutritional eff ect of agricultural programmes is inconclusive—except for vitamin A from biofortifi cation of orange sweet potatoes—largely because of poor quality evaluations. Social safety nets currently provide cash or food transfers to a billion poor people and victims of shocks (eg, natural disasters). Individual studies show some eff ects on younger children exposed for longer durations, but weaknesses in nutrition goals and actions, and poor service quality probably explain the scarcity of overall nutritional benefi ts. Combined early child development and nutrition interventions show promising additive or synergistic eff ects on child development—and in some cases nutrition—and could lead to substantial gains in cost, effi ciency, and eff ectiveness, but these programmes have yet to be tested at scale. Parental schooling is strongly associated with child nutrition, and the eff ectiveness of emerging school nutrition education programmes needs to be tested. Many of the programmes reviewed were not originally designed to improve nutrition yet have great potential to do so. Ways to enhance programme nutrition-sensitivity include: improve targeting; use conditions to stimulate participation; strengthen nutrition goals and actions; and optimise women’s nutrition, time, physical and mental health, and empowerment. Nutrition-sensitive programmes can help scale up nutrition-specifi c interventions and create a stimulating environment in which young children can grow and develop to their full potential.

TI  - The Historical, Environmental and Socio-economic Context of Forests and Tree-based Systems for Food Security and Nutrition
PY  - 2015
AB  - Forests and tree-based systems are an important component of rural landscapes, sustaining livelihoods and contributing to the food security and nutritional needs of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Historically, these systems developed under a wide variety of ecological conditions, and cultural and socio-economic contexts, as integrated approaches that combined management of forest and agricultural areas to provide primarily for the needs of producers and their local communities. Today they serve food and nutrition demands of growing global populations, both urban and rural. Population increase, globalisation, deforestation, land degradation, and ever-increasing demand and associated conflict for land (including forest) resources are placing pressure on these lands. Farmers have been encouraged to intensify food production on existing agricultural lands, by modifying some traditional practices (such as agroforestry) or abandoning others (such as shifting cultivation) that evolved over centuries to cope with biophysical constraints (e.g. limited soil fertility, climate variability) and changing socio-economic conditions. This chapter provides an overview of forests and tree-based systems and their role in enhancing food security and nutrition for rural communities and those served through the marketplace. The variability and viability of these management systems are considered within and across geographical regions and agro-ecological zones. Also discussed is the role of the social, cultural and economic contexts in which these systems exist, with a focus on three factors that affect the socio-economic organisation of forests and tree-based systems, namely: land and tree tenure and governance, human capital (including knowledge and labour) and financial capital (including credit). How these biophysical and socio-economic conditions and their complex interactions influence food security and nutrition outcomes, particularly for vulnerable segments of the population (i.e., the poor, women and children), are of particular concern.

TI  - Women’s empowerment and nutrition status: The case of iron deficiency in India
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract In this paper we study the relationship between women’s empowerment in agriculture and their iron deficiency status in Maharashtra, India. This is the first time the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) has been used in association with explicit measurement of medical biomarkers for women’s iron deficiency status. Using primary data for 960 women we find that the log odds of a poor iron status in women decline as women’s empowerment levels in agriculture improve. Further, this decline is seen in the presence of multiple dietary diversity measures (dietary diversity score, share of rice and wheat in the diet, total iron intake and iron intake from iron-rich food groups – all for 24-h and 30-day recalls) suggesting that in addition to dietary pathways women’s empowerment can play a role in addressing micronutrient deficiencies like those of iron in a vulnerable sub-group of the population. It also reinforces the need to move away from the ‘staple grain fundamentalism’ that has characterized agricultural policy in India, towards more nutrition-sensitive food systems.

TI  - An agriculture-nutrition intervention improved children's diet and growth in a randomized trial in Ghana.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Stunting in Ghana is associated with rural communities, poverty, and low education; integrated agricultural interventions can address the problem. This cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a 12-month intervention (inputs and training for poultry farming and home gardening, and nutrition and health education) on child diet and nutritional status. Sixteen clusters were identified and randomly assigned to intervention or control; communities within clusters were randomly chosen, and all interested, eligible mother-child pairs were enrolled (intervention: 8 clusters, 19 communities, and 287 households; control: 8 clusters, 20 communities, and 213 households). Intention-to-treat analyses were used to estimate the effect of the intervention on endline minimum diet diversity (≥4 food groups), consumption of eggs, and length-for-age (LAZ)/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length (WLZ)/weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores; standard errors were corrected for clustering. Children were 10.5 ± 5.2 months (range: 0-32) at baseline and 29.8 ± 5.4 months (range: 13-48) at endline. Compared with children in the control group, children in the intervention group met minimum diet diversity (adjusted odds ratio = 1.65, 95% CI [1.02, 2.69]) and a higher LAZ/HAZ (β = 0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.34]) and WAZ (β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.00, 0.30]). Sensitivity analyses with random-effects and mixed-effects models and as-treated analysis were consistent with the findings. There was no group difference in WLZ/WHZ. Integrated interventions that increase access to high-quality foods and nutrition education improve child nutrition.

TI  - Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture: A Systematic Review of Impact Pathways to Nutrition Outcomes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The role of agriculture in reducing undernutrition is widely recognized, yet there is also consensus on the need to make the sector nutrition-sensitive. Evidence on the impact pathways from nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions, agricultural interventions with specific nutrition objectives, and actions detailing each temporal stage to reach nutrition outcomes is limited, however. We thus synthesized study results regarding impact of NSA interventions on nutrition outcomes relating to undernutrition, and constructed an impact pathway by mapping the evidence on each temporal stage from interventions to nutrition outcomes. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to conduct and report our systematic review of studies on NSA interventions implemented in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Forty-three studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and synthesized across impact and pathways analyses. We carried out a thematic analysis of the effect of NSA interventions using evidence-based indicators and constructed the pathways by adopting a published framework on agriculture to nutrition pathways. Our findings reveal that NSA interventions can significantly improve dietary practices, and have the potential to enhance care practices and reduce occurrence of diseases, indicating their effectiveness in simultaneously addressing multiple determinants of undernutrition. However, NSA interventions have a lesser impact on nutritional status. NSA interventions lead to nutrition outcomes through 5 key pathways: food production, nutrition-related knowledge, agricultural income, women's empowerment, and strengthening of local institutions. We emphasize the need to carefully design, implement, and evaluate interventions with consideration for factors affecting impact pathways. Future research should focus on the effect of interventions combining multisector components, and pathways through non-food-production-related income, women's empowerment, strengthening of local institutions, food prices at intervention level, and expenditure on health care.

TI  - Agroecology and nutritional health: A comparison of agroecological farmers and their neighbors in the Ecuadorian highlands
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Agroecology has received much attention as a sustainable production strategy that may leverage agriculture-nutrition linkages to positively impact farmer nutritional health, but its potential has not been thoroughly established through empirical assessment. This mixed methods study uses survey data from Ecuador to assess how farmers' participation in agroecological associations may impact their diets. Our results suggest that agroecological farmers outperform reference farming neighbors on both nutrient adequacy (i.e. meeting key nutrient needs) and dietary moderation (i.e. avoiding dangerous excesses). Stronger nutrient adequacy is likely related to agroecological farmers' higher production diversity as well as the social and human capital developed within their networks, while stronger dietary moderation is likely related to their greater consumption of foods obtained through own-production and the social economy (e.g. barter). Dietary differences between agroecological and reference farmers occur despite similar incomes and other socioeconomic characteristics, and in fact, agroecological farmers achieve healthier diets while spending less money to purchase foods. Agroecology-based famers' networks may thus hold promise for integrating nutritional health priorities into sustainable food systems.

TI  - Micronutrient status of populations and preventive nutrition interventions in South East Asia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Objectives Since the 1990s, programs for the control of micronutrient deficiencies became a public health priority for many governments, including the countries partnering the project "Sustainable Micronutrient Interventions to Control Deficiencies and Improve Nutritional Status and General Health in Asia" (SMILING): Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos-PDR, Thailand and Vietnam. The aim of this study was to map which micronutrient deficiencies have been addressed and which interventions were in place in the SMILING countries. Methods The mapping covered the period up to 2012. Updated information from relevant surveys after 2012 is included in this paper after the completion of the SMILING project. The mapping of micronutrient status was limited to either national or at least large-scale surveys. Information on nutrition interventions obtained through a systematic mapping of national programs combined with a snowball collection from various sources. Results Among the five SMILING countries, Thailand differed historically by an early implementation of a nationwide community-based nutrition program, contributing to reductions in undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. For Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos PDR, and Vietnam, some national programs addressing micronutrients have been implemented following adjusted international recommendations. National surveys on micronutrient status were scattered and inconsistent across the countries in design and frequency. Conclusion for practice In conclusion, some micronutrient deficiencies were addressed in national interventions but the evidence of effects was generally lacking because of limited nationally representative data collected. Improvement of intervention programs to efficiently reduce or eliminate micronutrient deficiencies requires more systematic monitoring and evaluation of effects of interventions in order to identify best practices.

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture: What have we learned so far?
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract A growing number of governments, donor agencies, and development organizations are committed to supporting nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) to achieve their development goals. While consensus exists on pathways through which agriculture may influence nutrition-related outcomes, empirical evidence on agriculture's contribution to nutrition and how it can be enhanced is still weak. This paper reviews recent empirical evidence (since 2014), including findings from impact evaluations of a variety of NSA programs using experimental designs as well as observational studies that document linkages between agriculture, women's empowerment, and nutrition linkages. The paper summarizes existing knowledge regarding impacts, but also pathways, mechanisms, and contextual factors that affect where and how agriculture may improve nutrition outcomes. The paper concludes with reflections on implications for agricultural programs, policies, and investments, and highlights future research priorities.

TI  - Exploring food environment interventions for diet-related outcomes using a food sovereignty framework: a systematic review.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Building local food systems through a food sovereignty lens, harnessing the right of people to control their own food systems, may enhance healthy food access and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables in local communities. While research to date has described the outcomes of various multilevel, multicomponent food systems interventions, no known literature reviews to date have systematically examined food system interventions and dietary and health outcomes through the context of a food sovereignty lens. Utilization of a food sovereignty framework allows for the incorporation of key food systems and community-based concepts in the food environment literature. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe and summarize the efficacy of community-based local food system interventions, using the food sovereignty framework, for both pediatric and adult populations and their impact on health behaviors and physiological outcomes. We searched for peer-reviewed articles using Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases and identified 11 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study. Seven studies found that food systems interventions had a significant positive effect on improving health outcomes, three had null findings and one had null or negative results. Two studies utilized a community-based participatory approach. The most successful interventions involved community-based engagement involving multiple aspects of the food system and involving both children and adults for maximum impact. Our results inform how community-based food systems interventions can be guided by food sovereignty principles to improve health outcomes, such as body weight and fruit and vegetable intake, for both pediatric and adult populations.

TI  - Agricultural interventions for improved nutrition: A review of livelihood and environmental dimensions
PY  - 2016
AB  - A diverse group of agricultural interventions aim to improve the nutritional status of women and children. These interventions range from the cultivation of bio-fortified crop varieties to home gardening to livestock intensification. We systematically review 42 evaluations of agricultural interventions for improved maternal and child nutrition. Using these evaluations, we identify three intervention typologies – Enhancement, Diversification, and Substitution – that reflect the differential impact of interventions on household livelihoods and patterns of food consumption. Our typologies allow for a nuanced approach to categorize and generalize about pathways of impact for agricultural interventions. In applying our typologies to existing evaluations, we summarize the evidence base and emphasize areas for further inquiry, particularly in terms of understanding these interventions amid complex environmental, political and economic local contexts.

TI  - A qualitative examination of home and neighborhood environments for obesity prevention in rural adults.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Background: The home and neighborhood environments may be important in obesity prevention by virtue of food availability, food preparation, cues and opportunities for physical activity, and family support. To date, little research has examined how home and neighborhood environments in rural communities may support or hinder healthy eating and physical activity. This paper reports characteristics of rural homes and neighborhoods related to physical activity environments, availability of healthy foods, and family support for physical activity and maintaining an ideal body weight. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 60 African American and White adults over 50 years of age in two rural counties in Southwest Georgia. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded independently by two members of the research team using standard methods of qualitative analysis. Themes were then identified and data matrices were used to identify patterns by gender or race. Results: Neighborhood features that supported physical activity were plenty of land, minimal traffic and living in a safe and friendly neighborhood. The major barrier was lack of recreational facilities. The majority of participants were not physically active with their family members due to schedule conflicts and lack of time. Family member-initiated efforts to encourage physical activity met with mixed results, with refusals, procrastination, and increased activity all reported. Participants generally reported it was easy to get healthy foods, although cost barriers and the need to drive to a larger town for a supermarket with good variety were noted as obstacles. Family conversations about weight had occurred for about half of the participants, with reactions ranging from agreement about the need to lose weight to frustration. Conclusion: This study suggests that successful environmental change strategies to promote physical activity and healthy eating in rural neighborhoods may differ from those used in urban neighborhoods. The findings also provide insight into the complexities of family support for physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight. Addressing socio-ecologic factors has the potential to increase healthy behaviors and decrease the prevalence of obesity among rural residents.

TI  - Automated survey of selected common plant species in Thai homegardens using Google Street View imagery and a deep neural network
PY  - 2021
AB  - Most previous studies of homegardens have used labor-intensive boots-on-the-ground plant surveys, owner questionnaires, and interviews, limiting them to at most a few hundred homegardens. We show that automated analysis of publicly available imagery can enable surveys of much greater scale that can augment these traditional data sources. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the high-resolution street-level photographs in Google Street View and an object-detection network (RetinaNet) to create a large-scale high-resolution survey of the prevalence of at least six plant species widely grown in road-facing homegardens in Thailand. Our research team examined 4000 images facing perpendicular to the street and located within 10 m of a homestead, and manually outlined all perceived instances of eleven common plant species. A neural network trained on these tagged images was used to detect instances of these species in approximately 150,000 images constituting views of roughly one in every ten homesteads in five provinces of northern Thailand. The results for six of the plant species were visualized as heatmaps of both the average number of target species detected in each image and individual species prevalence, with spatial averaging performed at scales of 500 m and 2.5 km. Urban-rural contrasts in the average number of target species in each image are quantified, and large variations are observed even among neighboring villages. Spatial heterogeneity is seen to be more pronounced for banana and coconut than for other species. Star gooseberry and papaya are more frequently present immediately outside of towns while dracaena and mango persist into the cores of towns.

TI  - Impact and cost-effectiveness of women's training in home gardening and nutrition in Bangladesh
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACTThis study quantifies the impact and cost-effectiveness of training poor rural women in Bangladesh in home gardening and nutrition. We use baseline and follow-up data for 646 intervention and control households and apply a difference-in-difference estimator. We find that the intervention significantly (p < 0.01) increased vegetable production (+16.5 g/person/day), vegetable consumption and the micronutrient supply from the garden. Using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach, we show that the intervention can be considered cost-effective in abating iron, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies. Home garden interventions can therefore make an effective contribution to addressing micronutrient undernutrition.

TI  - Food security in South Africa: Status quo and policy imperatives
PY  - 2014
AB  - ABSTRACTAlthough the term itself was only developed in the 1970s, food security has played a central role in policies that have shaped the history of South Africa from the 17th century. As with the changing international interpretation of food security over the past four decades, South African food security determinants have been interpreted differently by different ruling authorities and governments over three centuries. The Natives Land Act of 1913 played a significant role in determining the food security context of the country in terms of the character, composition and contribution of the agricultural sector, shaped consumption patterns and determined rural livelihoods. While food security is expressed as a national objective in a plethora of strategies and programmes, no formal evaluation has been carried out of the food security impact of these programmes, and there is a dire lack of coordination and no enforceable policy to ensure food security. Any national food security policy will need a framewo...

TI  - Assessing food value chain pathways, linkages and impacts for better nutrition of vulnerable groups
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract This article offers insights into assessing the effectiveness of post farm-gate agri-food value chains at improving the nutrition intake of vulnerable groups. It develops a conceptual framework integrating the value chain concepts with agriculture and nutrition, and identifies key outcomes and requirements for value chains to be successful at delivering substantive and sustained consumption of nutrient-dense foods by poor households. Other frameworks linking value chains with nutrition have been published, but this article provides the analytical lens to assess post-farm-gate value chains. To achieve improvements in the intake of nutritious foods by the target populations food must be: safe to eat on a sustained basis; nutrient dense at the point of consumption; and consumed in adequate amounts on a sustained basis. This shifts the focus to the role of public actions and policy in terms of shaping the functioning of food value chains. By assessing the limits of what business can and cannot contribute in a given market context, policy-makers and other relevant stakeholders will be more capable of creating an appropriate institutional environment that shapes how value chains operate for the benefit of vulnerable target groups, designing and implementing effective policies and strategies with respect to the role and use of market-based interventions.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Dairy intensification as a development strategy is expected to improve household nutrition, yet the pathways by which this occurs are not well understood. This article examines how women’s time use and decision-making patterns related to dairy income and consumption are associated with dairy intensification, as a way of exploring the links between intensification and nutrition. Results from our mixed methods study conducted with households representing low, medium and high levels of dairy intensification in rural Kenya indicated that children in high-intensity households received more milk than children in medium-intensity households. While women seemed to be gaining control over evening milk sales decisions, men seemed to be increasingly controlling total dairy income, a trend countered by the increase in reported joint decision making. Women from medium-intensity households reported spending more time on dairy activities than women from high-intensity households. More research on how dairy interventions affect women is needed.

TI  - A review of interventions based on dietary diversification or modification strategies with the potential to enhance intakes of total and absorbable zinc.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Dietary diversification or modification has the potential to prevent deficiencies of zinc and other coexisting limiting micronutrients simultaneously, without risk of antagonistic interactions. In this review, we have addressed the following. The first section focuses on strategies with the potential to enhance intake and/or bioavailability of zinc, and includes interventions (with and without nutrition education) based on agriculture, production or promotion of animal-source foods through animal husbandry or aquaculture, and commercial and household processing strategies to enhance zinc absorption. Outcome indicators include intakes of foods or nutrients (although rarely zinc) and, in some cases, zinc status, or zinc-related functional responses. The next two sections address whether dietary diversification or modification can achieve increases in absorbable zinc that are sufficient to enhance zinc status or zinc-related functional responses in breastfed infants and toddlers and in older children and women of reproductive age. Evidence for the impact of dietary diversification or modification on behavior change and on nutritional status in the short and long term, and the possible role of modifying factors (e.g., baseline nutritional status, socioeconomic status, infection, sex, age, and life-stage group) is the emphasis of the next section. The following section highlights the evidence for three potential adverse effects of dietary diversification or modification: aflatoxin contamination from germinated cereals, loss of water-soluble nutrients, and displacement of breastmilk. Finally, an example of a dietary diversification or modification program (Homestead Food Production) developed and implemented by Helen Keller International is given, together with the critical steps needed to scale up dietary diversification or modification for programs and future research needs.

TI  - Econutrition: Preventing Malnutrition with Agrodiversity Interventions
PY  - 2009
AB  - Macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies continue to be serious problems in lower income countries. Based on available published studies, agrodiversity interventions can significantly improve nutritional outcomes, and these results improve further with well-planned designs as well as with additional inputs above and beyond physical inputs (e.g., nutrition education and gender considerations). There exists a strong micronutrient bias in the agrodiversity literature, favoring vitamin A over iron in the vast majority of projects undertaken. Home gardening: there is a strong rationale for its status as the preferred agrodiversity intervention, yet more investments in scale-up projects are essential. There are many incentives for—and challenges to—investing in agrodiversity interventions. There is great need to infuse studies with uniform, quality methodology and to utilize indigenous expertise and crops in the design and implementation stages. Interventions should be tailored to the specific needs and realities of environments and cultures, and interdisciplinary cooperation among researchers is essential. Study quality, capital investments, education, new market opportunities, and gender considerations are all important when designing an ideal agrodiversity intervention.

TI  - Farming System for Nutrition-a pathway to dietary diversity: Evidence from India.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Farming is the main livelihood of a majority of people in India. The country is also home to a large population of undernourished people. This indicates potential for mainstreaming the nutrition dimension in the farming system to impact on nutrition outcomes. A Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) study was conducted in two agro-ecologically different locations from 2013-2018, to explore the feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. The baseline survey in 2013-2014 revealed that the population in the study area was largely undernourished and that household diets were cereal-dominated. The FSN model was designed in consultation with community members, to increase availability of nutrient-dense cereals and pulses, by enhancing production and crop diversification at the farm level, promoting cultivation of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in nutrition gardens and supporting interventions to promote access to animal foods. Nutrition awareness initiatives were undertaken to build capacity at the local level and translate production diversity to consumption diversity. An endline survey was conducted in 2017 (July-October), following three years of intervention. Crop, vegetable and animal food production and food consumption was compared with the baseline data. There was evidence of higher production and consumption of nutrient rich foods, improved household dietary diversity; and understanding and acceptance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The number of items consumed under each food group, frequency of consumption of food and average per capita intake of nutrient-rich foods were found to have improved. The results provide evidence regarding feasibility of location-specific FSN models to promote sustainable and healthy diets, using locally available plant and animal food resources, to address nutrition deficiencies in farm families.

TI  - PHYLOPLANE ASSESSMENT OF LEAF AND STALK FOR CONSUMPTION AND MICROBIAL DIVERSITY OF SWEET POTATO (IPOMOEA BATATAS (L) LAM., CONVOLVULACEAE)
PY  - 2013
AB  - The nutrient and microbial contents of the leaves and stalks of two varieties of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., Convolvulaceae) were determined using standard analytical methods in order to ascertain its quality as a food material. The samples were found to contain a diverse array of carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fats, crude fiber and ash containing mineral deposits with potential nutritional benefits. However, the quick perishability of the food material is a major constraint to its wider utilization for consumption and this was attributed to the microbial load in it. The leaves and stalks contained strains of bacteria and fungi whose analyses were determined using pour plate method. The purple variety samples had lesser numbers of microbial loads in it while the white variety samples had more microbial load in it on the pour plate method. The pour plate method is a microbiological procedure used for isolating and growing individual colonies of micro organisms in pure culture. Pure cultures of the isolated organisms were identified through their colony appearance and microscopic observation of the stained samples. Some biochemical tests were conducted for the characterization of bacteria isolates. The shelf life of sweet potato leaves and stalks can be ascertained knowing the particular microorganisms present. It is important that consumers of this food material always harvest cultivars that have no sign of deterioration and food safety precautions should be adhered to in order to avoid consuming the toxic anti-nutrients.

TI  - A model-based exploration of farm-household livelihood and nutrition indicators to guide nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Assessing progress towards healthier people, farms and landscapes through nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) requires transdisciplinary methods with robust models and metrics. Farm-household models could facilitate disentangling the complex agriculture-nutrition nexus, by jointly assessing performance indicators on different farm system components such as farm productivity, farm environmental performance, household nutrition, and livelihoods. We, therefore, applied a farm-household model, FarmDESIGN, expanded to more comprehensively capture household nutrition and production diversity, diet diversity, and nutrient adequacy metrics. We estimated the potential contribution of an NSA intervention targeting the diversification of home gardens, aimed at reducing nutritional gaps and improving livelihoods in rural Vietnam. We addressed three central questions: (1) Do ‘Selected Crops’ (i.e. crops identified in a participatory process) in the intervention contribute to satisfying household dietary requirements?; (2) Does the adoption of Selected Crops contribute to improving household livelihoods (i.e. does it increase leisure time for non-earning activities as well as the dispensable budget)?; and (3) Do the proposed nutrition-related metrics estimate the contribution of home-garden diversification towards satisfying household dietary requirements? Results indicate trade-offs between nutrition and dispensable budget, with limited farm-household configurations leading to jointly improved nutrition and livelihoods. FarmDESIGN facilitated testing the robustness and limitations of commonly used metrics to monitor progress towards NSA. Results indicate that most of the production diversity metrics performed poorly at predicting desirable nutritional outcomes in this modelling study. This study demonstrates that farm-household models can facilitate anticipating the effect (positive or negative) of agricultural interventions on nutrition and the environment, identifying complementary interventions for significant and positive results and helping to foresee the trade-offs that farm-households could face. Furthermore, FarmDESIGN could contribute to identifying agreed-upon and robust metrics for measuring nutritional outcomes at the farm-household level, to allow comparability between contexts and NSA interventions.

TI  - From the field: Empowering women to improve family food security in Afghanistan
PY  - 2014
AB  - Kitchen gardens may improve family food security and nutrition. While these gardens are the domain of women in Afghanistan, women face unique challenges accessing training and resources to maximize small-scale agricultural output. The University of Maryland's Women in Agriculture Project builds capacity among female extension educators to work with vulnerable women to implement and maintain kitchen gardens. Extension educators use experiential methods to teach vegetable gardening, apiculture, small-scale poultry production, post-harvest handling and processing, nutrition and marketing through workshops, demonstration gardens and farmer field schools. This paper explores contextual factors related to women's food security and agricultural opportunities, describes key project activities and approaches and discusses project success and challenges, sustainability and implications for future programs.

TI  - Community perspectives on food security and dietary diversity among rural smallholder farmers: A qualitative study in central Uganda
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Smallholder farmers produce majority of food in developing countries yet continue to be vulnerable to poverty, food insecurity, limited diet quality and diversity, malnutrition, and face various production challenges. Though quantitative studies have explored determinants of dietary diversity among farmers, this data can be further enriched with farmer experiences and perspectives of whether and how these factors affect dietary diversity to inform intervention design and implementation. A qualitative study was conducted among rural smallholder farmers in Kiboga district, Central Uganda with 28 participants in eight focus group discussions (four groups with men and four groups with women). The results showed that both men and women were concerned about food security and dietary diversity and viewed household food production as pivotal to food security. Purchase of food was affected by prices, household income, distance to markets and food diversity in the accessed markets. Major determinants of dietary diversity included household food production, agricultural and nutrition knowledge and awareness, information access and use, household income, and time. Poor perception towards meetings, insufficient nutrition information, skills and training were also noted. Gender influences and differences noted were concerned with allocation and use of harvested food and income within the household; more men than women having a poor perception towards meetings/trainings; and women having limited time for agricultural and nutrition practices that support dietary diversity. From the results, efforts to improve dietary diversity should address the food security and production challenges faced; support income generation whether on- or off-farm and market access to diverse foods; use designs that address gender issues and are labor and time sensitive; and include capacity building in nutrition and practices that support access to and utilization of diverse food baskets, and social behavior change strategies.

TI  - Women’s empowerment, food security and nutrition of pastoral communities in Tanzania
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract This paper presents a mixed-methods study that examines the relationship between women’s empowerment, household food security, and maternal and child diet diversity (as one indicator of nutrition security) in two regions of Tanzania. Indicators across three domains of women’s empowerment were scored and matched to a household food insecurity access scale. Qualitative research helped appreciate the gender dynamics affecting the women’s empowerment-food security and women’s empowerment-nutrition security nexus. In cluster adjusted regression analyses, scores from each domain were significantly associated with women’s dietary diversity, but not with household food security. All three empowerment domains were positively associated with food security and nutrition in the qualitative analysis. This article discusses these findings and shows the pathways by which respondents saw their empowerment to affect their household food security.

TI  - A Food-Based Approach Introducing Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potatoes Increased Vitamin A Intake and Serum Retinol Concentrations in Young Children in Rural Mozambique
PY  - 2007
AB  - Vitamin A deficiency is widespread and has severe consequences for young children in the developing world. Food-based approaches may be an appropriate and sustainable complement to supplementation programs. Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is rich in b-carotene and is well accepted by young children. In an extremely resource poor area in Mozambique, the effectiveness of introduction of OFSP was assessed in an integrated agriculture and nutrition intervention, which aimed to increase vitamin A intake and serum retinol concentrations in young children. The 2-y quasiexperimental intervention study followed households and children (n ¼ 741; mean age 13 mo at baseline) through 2 agricultural cycles. In y 2, 90% of intervention households produced OFSP, and mean OFSP plot size in intervention areas increased from 33 to 359 m 2 . Intervention children (n ¼ 498) were more likely than control children (n ¼ 243) to eat OFSP 3 or more d in the last wk (55% vs. 8%, P , 0.001) and their vitamin A intakes were much higher than those of control children (median 426 vs. 56 mg retinol activity equivalent, P , 0.001). Controlling for infection/inflammation and other confounders, mean serum retinol increased by 0.100 mmol/L (SEM 0.024; P , 0.001) in intervention children and did not increase significantly in control subjects. Integrated promotion of OFSP can complement other approaches and contribute to increases in vitamin A intake and serum retinol concentrations in young children in rural Mozambique and similar areas in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Assessing the relative importance of dairy products to family nutrition in mixed crop-livestock production systems of Ethiopia
PY  - 2015
AB  - Livestock forms an integral part and contributes in multiple ways to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the crop-livestock systems of Ethiopia. This study presents empirical evidence of the relative importance of the consumption of dairy products to family nutrition and factors underlying differences among farm households. Cattle owning households (n = 270) and their under-5-year-old children (n = 225) were sampled for this study. Multiple approaches were applied for data collection, including a cross-sectional survey, in-depth household monitoring, a dietary diversity survey and anthropometric measurements of children. Household dietary diversity scores were low (4.6 ± 1.3), mainly comprising maize, Enset, green kales and milk products. The consumption of non-dairy Animal Source Foods (ASF: beef, mutton, chicken meat, eggs and fish) was low, intermittent and peaked during major religious or social festivities. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) revealed substantial associations between anthropometric indices of children and socio-economic status of their parents. Specifically, predictors assigned the greatest weights, in descending order, were per capita farmland size, family size, access to clean water, crop diversity, dependency ratio, livestock holding, cash income, literacy of household head, distance to public health centres, and volume of milk available in the households. Although cow milk was identified as an important food item for children, their nutritional status was influenced by manifold factors that affect their dietary quality, health and care. Therefore, holistic approaches that embrace effective coordination among different economic sectors - notably agriculture, public health education and provision of clean water are required to achieve food and nutritional security among farming households.

TI  - A conceptual framework for understanding the impacts of agriculture and food system policies on nutrition and health
PY  - 2015
AB  - Agriculture and food systems are important determinants of nutrition and consequent public health. However, an understanding of the links among agriculture, food systems, nutrition, public health and the associated policy levers, is relatively under-developed. A framework conceptualizing these key relationships, relevant to a range of country contexts, would help inform policymakers as to how agriculture and food policy could improve nutrition and public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The objectives of this paper are: to present a conceptual framework, relevant to a range of country contexts and focused on the policymaker as the user, which depicts the key relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health; and to describe how the framework can be used for understanding the impacts of agriculture and food system policies on nutrition outcomes. Existing conceptual frameworks, highlighting the relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health (n = 37) were identified, reviewed and categorized, based on the key themes they address. Building on this analysis and synthesis a conceptual framework was developed that assists in identifying associated policy levers and their effects on elements of the framework. The end product is a conceptual framework that presents key domains linking agriculture and food systems to nutritional outcomes and public health. The framework is relevant to a range of contexts, for example low-, middle- and high-income settings; and to policymakers wishing to examine the potential direct and indirect impacts of agriculture and food system policies.

TI  - Integrated community‐based growth monitoring and vegetable gardens focusing on crops rich in β‐carotene: Project evaluation in a rural community in the Eastern Cape, South Africa
PY  - 2008
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cultivation in β-carotene vegetables was promoted in a crop-based intervention in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, South Africa. The project also included nutrition education and community-based growth monitoring, and focused on technology transfer and mobilisation of local organisations. Three years after initiation of the project, participating (n = 219) and non-participating (n = 223) households were compared in terms of child morbidity, nutritional knowledge, dietary intake and gardening practices. RESULTS: Compared to control households, more caregivers from project households thought that yellow fruit and vegetables were good for their children (73% vs. 45%; P < 0.001), were familiar with the term ‘vitamin A’ (89% vs. 63%; P < 0.001), knew that vitamin A is a nutrient in food (83% vs. 53%; P < 0.001), and could name three food sources rich in vitamin A (56% vs. 27%; P < 0.001). Fewer 1–5-year-old children in the project households reportedly experienced vomiting (6% vs. 13%; P = 0.012), fever (30% vs. 42%; P = 0.008), sores on the skin (6% vs. 19%; P < 0.001), continuous runny nose (20% vs. 33%; P = 0.002), diarrhoea (2% vs. 7%; P = 0.026) and poor appetite (7% vs. 14%; P = 0.016). Children from project households consumed carrot (P = 0.008), butternut (P = 0.002), spinach (P = 0.004) and orange-fleshed sweetpotato (P = 0.028) more frequently than children from control households. CONCLUSION: The agricultural intervention, combined with nutrition education and community-based growth monitoring, showed a favourable effect on child morbidity, nutritional knowledge and dietary intake of β-carotene-rich vegetables. Agricultural interventions can therefore contribute significantly towards nutritional outcomes. Copyright © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Adapting the Women's empowerment in agriculture index to specific country context: Insights and critiques from fieldwork in India
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a direct, multi-dimensional measure of women's access to resources and decision-making in various domains of agriculture. However, several challenges characterize its use: adaptation of questionnaires to local agricultural contexts, modifications to index construction once underlying activities and adequacy thresholds are modified, and sensitivity analysis. In this paper, we address such challenges based on our experience of adapting and using the WEAI across 3600 households in India. In doing so we contribute to the methodological and technical base underlying the index, expand the WEAI evidence base for South Asia, and highlight the importance of tailoring the index to specific agricultural contexts in order to impact public policies in a meaningful way.

TI  - A food-based approach to reduce vitamin a deficiency in southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study of maternal nutrition and health indicators
PY  - 2017
AB  - One micronutrient essential for proper growth and development is Vitamin A. Children and pregnant women are most susceptible to vitamin A deficiency (VAD) because of the higher intake requirements needed during critical growth periods. Vitamin A deficiency is a serious but preventable public health problem in Ethiopia. In 2012, the International Potato Center (CIP) partnered with the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) and local stakeholders in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia, to address the issue of VAD among rural SNNPR households by increasing production and consumption of orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP). This paper presents a cross-sectional analysis of vitamin A knowledge, consumption practices, and OFSP agronomic practices from surveys conducted among households who participated in a food-based intervention. The study population consisted of 150 mothers from rural households in five districts in the Sidama and Wolayta zones in the SNNPR. Data were collected during April and May 2013 by trained enumerators in the local language using structured questionnaires. Surveys were adapted from validated instruments, and included questions about household socioeconomic characteristics, agricultural practices, dietary diversity, food security, and general health for women between 20-60 years and children between 6-59 months. Among respondents, 63% of mothers reported knowledge about vitamin A, with responses varying by geographic location. Among those who reported knowledge about vitamin A, 8% identified OFSP as a source, 1% had consumed OFSP in the past 7 days, and 0% reported that they ever prepared OFSP with an animal- or vegetable-based fat. Vitamin A-related health issues reported by mothers include night-blindness (32%), measles (32%) and malaria (72%). Given that existing knowledge, behaviors and production levels of vitamin A rich foods (including OFSP) are limited within the SNNPR study population and vary by geographic location, an integrated, food-based approach to address VAD may be relevant in this context to sustainably support improved health and livelihoods.

TI  - The Primacy of Politics in Public Food Security Policies: The Case of Home Gardens
PY  - 2020
AB  - Home gardens are often conceived as a panacea to contribute to the problem of food insecurity in poor rural and urban households. However, systematic reviews indicate weak evidence of significant impacts on families. This way, there has been an intense discussion about their effectiveness. This research aims to generate knowledge about the relevance of assuming food production in home gardens as an alternative to the home consumption. Two questions drive this paper: what number of home gardens, supported by three different government programs, persists? Moreover, what factors explain their permanence? Our sample constituted 261 beneficiaries, and the collection of data was through face-to-face field surveys and in situ visits to the vegetable garden granted. We show that less than 7.5% of gardens remain in right conditions after two years of establishment. The pleasure and need to produce, family involvement, urban/rural location, and the technology provided are determining factors for permanence. The results support the argument that the high rate of home gardens that fail is related to the primacy of politics in considering the problem of food security as a “lack of assets” to produce. Thus, this suggests that there is a weak link between the problem, policies, and the politics.

TI  - How Does Composition of Household Income Affect Child Nutrition Outcomes? Evidence from Uganda
PY  - NA
AB  - This study attempts to fill the knowledge gap between the cross-country analyses that explore the links between income and nutrition without insights on micro-level determinants, and the numerous microeconomic studies that suggest mechanisms of impact but are hindered by some combination of small sample size, incomplete data, and questionable approaches to impact estimation. The analysis uses the three annual waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, and features panel regressions of child anthropometric outcomes controlling for time-invariant childlevel heterogeneity and other time-variant observables. The paper starts by looking at how the outcomes correlate with short-term changes in rural household income. The impact is subsequently differentiated by sector of income, first between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, and by type of agriculture. The analysis documents no impact of short-term changes in total gross income on weight-related measures but documents positive effects on height-related outcomes. Sector-differentiated analyses indicate that only the share of income originating from non-farm self-employment exerts positive and statistically significant effects on both height and weight measures. For height, the income shares pertaining to (i) consumption of own crop production and (ii) low-protein crop production appear to be underlining the negative effect of the share of income originating from crop production. The results suggest stickiness of crop production to own consumption, and while this may be nutrition-supporting in some contexts, income growth in the production of low-nutrient crops in Uganda may crowd out consumption of other goods and services that have the potential to serve as better nutritional investments.

TI  - Connecting the food and agriculture sector to nutrition interventions for improved health outcomes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText>To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger, multi-sectoral strategies to improve nutrition are necessary. Building towards this goal, the food and agriculture sector must be considered when designing nutritional interventions. Nevertheless, most frameworks designed to guide nutritional interventions do not adequately capture opportunities for integrating nutrition interventions within the food and agriculture sector. This paper aims to highlight how deeply connected the food and agriculture sector is to underlying causes of malnutrition and identify opportunities to better integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition in low and middle income countries. In particular, this paper: (1) expands on the UNICEF conceptual framework for undernutrition to integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition outcomes, (2) identifies how nutritional outcomes and agriculture are linked in six important ways by defining evidence-based food and agriculture system components within these pathways: as a source of food, as a source of income, through food prices, women's empowerment, women's utilization of time, and women's health and nutritional status, and (3) shows that the food and agriculture sector facilitates interventions through production, processing and consumption, as well as through farmer practices and behavior. Current frameworks used to guide nutrition interventions are designed from a health sector paradigm, leaving agricultural aspects not sufficiently leveraged. This paper concludes by proposing intervention opportunities to rectify the missed opportunities generated by this approach. Program design should consider the ways that the food and agriculture sector is linked to other critical sectors to comprehensively address malnutrition. This framework is designed to help the user to begin to identify intervention sites that may be considered when planning and implementing multi-sectoral nutrition programs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Supplementary Information" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12571-022-01262-3.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Challenges and opportunities to the African agriculture and food systems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Reduction in the proportion of undernourished people worldwide has been achieved despite global population increase. However, the achievement of reducing undernourishment globally was uneven; sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular has the least progress. In SSA, agriculture is only slowly changing with actual well below potential yields. Failures in agricultural policies, weak institutions, and poor governance are the root of growth stagnation. Agriculture contributes a significant share to the SSA economy and a majority of the population derives their livelihood from this sector. It is justifiable to assume that for sustainable growth of the African economy, significant investment and creative innovation in agriculture are needed. However, several factors such as growth of the farming population, loss of soil fertility, climate change, water scarcity, post-harvest losses, and limited market access could challenge such expectation. On the other hand, new policy reforms and initiatives, and appropriate investment that directly or indirectly support agricultural innovation and growth are emerging. This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities to advance agricultural growth and food systems in Africa and makes recommendations for solutions. Keywords: Africa, food systems, agriculture, agricultural research, agricultural investment

TI  - The role of forests, trees and wild biodiversity for nutrition-sensitive food systems and landscapes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Many contend that in order to overcome the world's nutrition problems, nutrition must become a cross-cutting issue, with concrete commitment and attention from a wide range of disciplines. From this assertion has grown the promotion of nutrition-sensitive approaches to economic growth, development, agriculture and food systems (nutrition-specific interventions target malnutrition directly, whereas nutrition-sensitive interventions target the causes of malnutrition by integrating nutrition into policies and programs in diverse sectors). There have been repeated calls for the international community to prioritize identification ways to leverage agriculture (and agricultural landscapes) to enhance nutrition (and health). Land use change is an often overlooked driver of change in diets, nutrition and food security, especially for rural communities. The synergies between food systems approaches to food security and nutrition and landscape approaches to integrated biodiversity and forest conservation should be explored and built on.

TI  - Solar-powered drip irrigation enhances food security in the Sudano-Sahel.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population over the next half-century will require technologies that significantly improve rural livelihoods at minimal environmental cost. These technologies will likely be distinct from those of the Green Revolution, which had relatively little impact in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, few such interventions have been rigorously evaluated. This paper analyzes solar-powered drip irrigation as a strategy for enhancing food security in the rural Sudano–Sahel region of West Africa. Using a matched-pair comparison of villages in northern Benin (two treatment villages, two comparison villages), and household survey and field-level data through the first year of harvest in those villages, we find that solar-powered drip irrigation significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season, and is cost effective compared to alternative technologies.

TI  - Reducing Anemia Prevalence in Afghanistan: Socioeconomic Correlates and the Particular Role of Agricultural Assets
PY  - 2016
AB  - This research aims to examine the socio-economic correlates of anemia in women, and potential sources of iron in household diets in Afghanistan. It also examines whether ownership of agricultural (particularly livestock) assets and their use in food production has a role in alleviating anaemia, especially where local markets may be inadequate. We analyse data from the 2010/11 Afghanistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, estimating a logistic regression to examine how anemia status of women is associated with socio-economic covariates. A key result found is that sheep ownership has a protective effect in reducing anemia (prevalence odds ratio of sheep ownership on anemia of 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73–0.94) after controlling for wealth and other covariates. This association is found to be robust to alternative model specifications. Given the central role of red meat in heme iron provision and absorption of non-heme iron, we hypothesise that sheep ownership promotes mutton consumption from own-production in a setting where market-sourced provision of nutritious food is a challenge. We then use the 2011/12 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment household data to understand the Afghan diet from the perspective of dietary iron provision, and to understand interactions between own-production, market sourcing and mutton consumption. Sheep ownership is found to increase the likelihood that a household consumed mutton (odds ratio of 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15–1.42), the number of days in the week that mutton was consumed (prevalence rate ratio of 1.24. 95% CI: 1.12–1.37) and the quantity of mutton consumed (7 grams/person/week). In the subsample of mutton consumers, households sourcing mutton mostly from own production consumed mutton 1.5 days more frequently on average than households relying on market purchase, resulting in 100 grams per person per week higher mutton intake. Thus this analysis lends support to the notion that the linkage between sheep ownership and anemia risk is at least partly due to consumption arising from own-production in the presence of market incompleteness.

TI  - Review: Time use as an explanation for the agri-nutrition disconnect? Evidence from rural areas in low and middle income countries
PY  - 2018
AB  - Time is a vital input into nutritional outcomes, as it is necessary for the production, procurement and preparation of food, child feeding and childcare. Thus, agricultural interventions may fail to improve nutritional outcomes if they do not take account of time constraints, particularly of rural women who spend a considerable portion of their time in agriculture. Given the potential trade-offs pertaining to time in productive vs. reproductive activities and its implications for maternal and child nutrition, the goal of this review is to systematically map and assess the available evidence, both qualitative and quantitative studies, agriculture-time use-nutrition pathway. Through an analysis of 89 studies, identified through a systematic search, on rural areas of low and middle-income countries, we observe three findings. First, women play a key role in agriculture, as reflected in their time commitments. Second, evidence from a very limited set of studies suggests that agricultural interventions tend to increase time commitments in agriculture of the household members for whom impact is measured. Third, while changing time use tends to change nutritional outcomes, it does so in a range of complex ways and there is no agreement on the impact. Nutritional impacts are varied because households and household members respond to increased time burden and workload in different ways.

TI  - Agricultural production diversity and child nutrition in Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study investigates how two aspects of agricultural production diversity – farm production diversity and composition of production – relate to child height-for-age and weight-for-height in Ethiopia. We use longitudinal data on child anthropometric measurements, household farm production diversity and farm production composition from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey for 2011, 2013, and 2015 available through the World Bank. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we show that an increase in farm production diversity reduces the risk of chronic food insecurity (child height-for-age) but has no impact on acute measures of food insecurity (child weight-for-height). Results also suggest that, in a context of poor rainfall, more diversity in farm production can adversely impact child height-for-age, although livestock sales might mitigate that detrimental effect. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between farm-level food production and child nutrition in a context of climate change.

TI  - The Nutrition Transformation: From Undernutrition to Obesity
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over the last three decades, policy interventions have resulted in a decrease in undernourishment by at least ten percentage points. However, undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency remain a critical public health challenge, especially in less developed states, while the number of overweight individuals has increased drastically in more developed states over the same period. This increase in the triple burden of malnutrition is a matter of great concern due to its impacts on health and welfare. In this chapter, we present evidence that diversifying diets and increasing income is vital for reducing all types of malnutrition. Within households, improving education and information, behavior change, empowering women and improving access to water, sanitation and health infrastructure are essential to tackle undernutrition, hidden hunger and obesity.

TI  - Women’s empowerment in Indian agriculture: does market orientation of farming systems matter?
PY  - 2017
AB  - This paper studies the relationship between the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) and market orientation of farm production in India. This is the first time that the WEAI has been used in an Indian agricultural context and the first time that it is being associated with market orientation. We used data on 1920 adults from 960 households in the Chandrapur District of Maharashtra and classified the households into three groups—(1) landless, (2) food-cropping, and (3) cash-cropping—that reflect increasing degrees of market orientation. We foind that women are disempowered in two major domains of agriculture—resources (access and decision-making) and leadership (group membership). A multivariate regression analysis shows that empowerment levels were significantly higher for women belonging to cash-cropping households, followed by food-cropping and landless households. Other significant determinants of empowerment scores are women’s age, education level, and household-level characteristics such as ownership of livestock, irrigation, electricity, and amount of land owned. As a secondary objective of this paper, we find that women’s empowerment in agriculture was also significantly associated with their decision-making in non-agricultural domains. The strong relationship between market orientation and empowerment levels suggests that linking women to markets can be a pathway to enhancing their empowerment in agricultural domains. Ensuring their ability to make decisions related to the cultivation of crops and their participation in the sale of those crops, with associated income, can be some areas for which relevant policies can be designed, tried, and studied.

TI  - Unravelling inclusive business models for achieving food and nutrition security in BOP markets
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract There is a growing consensus that one of the key priorities to address food and nutrition security is to aim at the transformation of agriculture and food systems. The private sector can fulfil an important role in this. It is often argued that the success at low income markets (denoted here as Bottom of the Pyramid - BOP) requires innovative and inclusive business models. However, research findings on this have been quite descriptive and generic. The literature on private sector engagement and food and nutrition security has a strong focus on the participation of businesses in the value chain and the food system, but does generally not unravel the specific characteristics of the inclusive business model itself. This article aims to contribute to an improved understanding with regard to inclusive business model characteristics of private sector interventions aiming at food and nutrition security improvements, by scrutinizing 16 cases from Africa, Asia and Latin America. The study focuses on the internal fitness of the strategic business model by analysing the foundation level components of the inclusive business model. Important findings are the relevance of quality of product or service besides its affordability, marketing and distribution strategies to link the different actors in the value chain, and training as well as coalition building to overcome institutional and cultural gaps and increase the success of the inclusive business model for improved nutrition and food security. An important conclusion is that the business model and business ecosystem of BOP markets is crucial. Also, the findings indicate a need for intermediaries to overcome cultural and institutional gaps in implementing inclusive business models.

TI  - Impact of permagarden intervention on improving fruit and vegetable intake among vulnerable groups in an urban setting of Ethiopia: A quasi-experimental study.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background Increasing nutrient intake through home gardening is a sustainable way to address multiple micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries. This study investigated the impact of permagarden intervention in increasing the frequency and diversity of vegetable and fruit consumption among vulnerable families in seven cities of Ethiopia. Method A quasi-experimental study was conducted from August 10 to September 30, 2015. A total of 884 care givers (427 from intervention and 457 from control) participated in the study. Data were collected through face to face interviews with caregivers of highly vulnerable children. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used as implemented in STATA software. Program impact on the frequency and diversity of households’ fruit and vegetable consumption between intervention and control groups was assessed using chi square test. Results Intervention participants had a 13% higher increase in frequency of vegetable and fruit consumption compared with control participants (p<0.01). Diversity (consumption of 2 or more groups of vegetable and fruit) is higher among intervention groups than control groups (percentage difference = 9, p-value<0.05). A significant higher percentage of participants in intervention group reported getting the one-week vegetable and fruit mainly from their own garden (percentage difference 58.3%, p<0.05). A significantly larger proportion of participants in the intervention group compared to control group reported “high likelihood” on intention to grow vegetables in the future (percentage difference = 30%, and P<0.01). Perceived importance to include vegetable in everyday meal was higher among intervention group participants than control group participants (percentage difference = 11.5%, P<0.01). Conclusions The observed higher FV intake among permagarden intervention group compared to control group suggest that nutrition and health programs need to promote permagarden as a means to improve FV intake among vulnerable societies in resource limited countries.

TI  - The process of developing a nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention: a multi-site experience
PY  - 2016
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions are of increasing interest to those working in global health and nutrition. However NSA is a broad concept, and there are numerous candidate NSA interventions that could be implemented in any given setting. While most agriculture interventions can be made “nutrition-sensitive”, there are few guidelines for helping to decide what agriculture component should be tried in an NSA intervention. Based on previous models, we developed a framework with explicit questions about community factors (agricultural production, diets, power and gender), project factors (team capacity, budget, timelines) and external factors that helped our team of agriculture scientists, nutritionists and local officials identify NSA interventions that may be feasibly implemented with a reasonable chance of having positive agricultural and nutritional impacts. We applied this framework to two settings in upland Vietnam, and one setting in upland Thailand. From an initial list of nineteen interventions that have been tried elsewhere, or may reasonably be expected to be appropriate for NSA, five or six candidate interventions were chosen per site. Based on the criteria, three to four interventions were selected per site and are being implemented. Poultry rearing and home gardening were selected in each site. They and the other selected interventions, hold promise for capitalizing on underused agricultural potential to improve diets, while working with (or improving) existing gender relationships and power structures. The process for identifying NSA interventions was thorough and identified reasonable candidates, but it was very time consuming. Further efforts should focus on streamlining the process, so that promising and appropriate NSA interventions can be identified quickly and reliably.

TI  - Impact of agricultural interventions on the nutritional status in South Asia: A review.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Nearly half of the malnourished population of the world lives in South Asia, and agriculture is the main source of livelihood of the people in this region. Many review exercises have analysed the available evidences to understand the ways in which agriculture can be leveraged to enhance nutritional status; however, very few of them have employed a systematic approach ensuring internal and external validity. The present paper seeks to fill this gap for strengthening the policy recommendations. It demonstrates an association between agricultural interventions and nutritional outcomes; and it shows that the production of targeted nutrition-rich crops, homestead gardens, and diversification of the agricultural production system towards fruits and vegetables and aquaculture can potentially improve nutrient intake and nutritional outcomes. The empowerment of women and nutrition knowledge play a crucial role in establishing linkage between agriculture and nutritional outcomes.

TI  - Seasonality and household diets in Ethiopia.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Objective To revisit seasonality by assessing how household diets vary across agricultural seasons in rural and urban Ethiopia. The role of seasonality on the sources and intake of energy (per capita) and household dietary diversity score (HDDS) was analysed. Design The use of nationally representative household-level data collected each month over one year to study the seasonal changes in the sources and intake of energy and HDDS. Setting Eleven regions of Ethiopia, including rural and urban settings. Subjects Total of 27 835 households were interviewed between July 2010 and July 2011 in all eleven regions of the country. On average each month saw 2300 household interviews, yielding nationally representative data for each calendar month. Results For rural households, the mean daily per capita energy intake was 10 288 kJ (2459 kcal) in February (post-harvest period) and lower in the lean season: 9703 kJ (2319 kcal) in June (P<0·05) and 9552 kJ (2283 kcal) in July (P<0·001). HDDS for rural households was highest in February (6·73) and lowest in June (5·98; P<0·001) but high again in July (6·57). Urban energy intake was also lower in the lean season but HDDS varied less by season. Considerable seasonal variation was also found in energy sources in rural areas, less so in urban areas. Conclusions Household diets in Ethiopia remain subjected to significant seasonal stress. HDDS and food security measured using energy intake do not always agree. Preferably, HDDS and energy intake data should be used together to assess food security.

TI  - Farmers’ tales: adaptive strategies for agricultural commercialisation and food and nutrition security in Myanmar
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study presents a rich and contextualised picture of farm household sense-making processes in relation to the rapid agricultural transition currently occurring in Myanmar, while considering the implications of these processes for household food and nutrition security (FNS). This research entailed a literature review on current views among key actors involved in agricultural development and food and nutrition security in Myanmar; a qualitative case study involving ‘positive deviant’ households engaged in agriculture commercialisation in the Dry Zone of Myanmar; and an exploratory analysis of social innovations among smallholder farmers. The reports concluded with a number of reflections and suggestions drawn from the analysis of farmers’ narratives and reflection on the implication of agricultural commercialisation on their livelihoods and diets

TI  - Understanding nutritional intake of Chinese farmers from the perspective of sustainable livelihood analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Based on the framework of sustainable livelihood analysis and using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, this paper examines the connection between livelihood assets and farmers’ nutritional intake. Results show that capital endowment and nutritional intake of farmers with diversified production are greater than those who specialize; capital endowment and nutritional intake of horticultural households are greater than those who engage in agriculture. Compared with non-economically disadvantaged households, higher livelihood assets have significant association with improved fat and protein intake of economically disadvantaged households. Compared with diversified farmers, more livelihood assets have significant association with improved energy and carbohydrate intake of agricultural households. Compared with those who specialize, additional livelihood assets have significant association with improved fat and protein intake of farmers with diversified production.

TI  - Effect of nutrition education on the knowledge scores of urban households with home gardens in Morogoro, Tanzania
PY  - 2016
AB  - Home gardens are an old agricultural practice playing a key role in household food security and diversity. Proximity of gardens to the home facilitates easy access to food and reduces household expenditure. Home gardens combined with nutrition education could improve household diets both quantitatively and qualitatively. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a nutrition education intervention on families with home gardens in Morogoro, Tanzania. Two cross-sectional nutrition surveys were conducted at different time points, the baseline in October–November 2013 and endline in May–June 2014. Between the surveys, an intervention consisting of three interactive nutrition education sessions was conducted in December 2013. The study targeted forty households owning home gardens in urban areas of Morogoro municipality. Mixed methods were used to collect data, including semi-structured questionnaires for quantitative data and focus group discussions for qualitative data. The estimated marginal means showed small statistically non-significant improvements in knowledge scores for vitamin A (p = 0.145, partial η 2 = 0.065) and iron (p = 0.403, partial η 2 = 0.022). There were more positive scores observed for both nutrients at endline compared with baseline. Composite knowledge scores calculated for participants showed improvements in the category with scores between 3 and 6 points, for both nutrients. While a statistically significant improvement in knowledge scores was not observed, an increase in number of positive scores and composite knowledge scores indicate an improvement in nutrition knowledge among participants. These results show that families having home gardens and who are provided with nutrition education can improve the quality of their household diets. Nutrition education in combination with other agricultural interventions could be a potential tool to improve nutritional status and should be integrated into public health programmes and strategies.

TI  - Gender, nutrition- and climate-smart food production: Opportunities and trade-offs
PY  - 2013
AB  - Future food and nutrition security is threatened by climate change, overexploitation of natural resources and pervasive social inequalities. Promising solutions are often technology-focused and not necessarily developed consider- ing gender and social disparities. This paper addresses issues of gender and human development opportunities and trade- offs related to promoting improved technologies for agricul- tural development. We examined these aspects for conserva- tion agriculture (CA) as part of a cropping system with nutrition- and climate-smart potential. The paper is based on a literature review and field experiences from Zambia and Mexico. Findings point up situations where the promotion of CA for smallholders in developing countries may have undesired effects from gender and human development per- spectives, specifically relating to drudgery, nutrition and food security, residue use, assets, mechanization and extension. The direction and magnitude of potential trade-offs depend onthe local context and the specific intervention.The analysis is followed by a discussion of opportunities and pathways for mitigating the trade-offs, including gender transformative ap- proaches; engagement with alternative or non-traditional part- ners with different but complementary perspectives and strengths; "smart" combinations of technologies and ap- proaches; and policies for inclusive development.

TI  - Community-based grain banks using local foods for improved infant and young child feeding in Ethiopia.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The first thousand days of a childs life are critical for ensuring adequate nutrition to enable optimal health development and growth. Inadequate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices likely contribute to Ethiopias concerning malnutrition situation. Development partners in four regions of Ethiopia implemented community production of complementary food with womens groups processing local grains and legumes at grain banks to improve availability accessibility dietary diversity and timely introduction of complementary foods. The objective of this study was to establish the acceptability perceived impact feasibility and required inputs to sustain local grain bank interventions to improve IYCF. A subsidized barter system was used by mothers in the rural communities and flour was sold in the semi-urban context. Purposive sampling guided the qualitative study design and selection of project stakeholders. A total of 51 key informant interviews and 33 focus group discussions (n=237) were conducted. The grain bank flour was valued for its perceived diverse local ingredients; while the project was perceived as creating labour savings for women. The grain bank flour offered the potential to contribute to improved IYCF; however further dietary modification or fortification is needed to improve the micronutrient content. Dependence upon external inputs to subsidize the barter model and the reliance on volunteer labour from womens groups in the rural context are the greatest risks to sustainability. This intervention illustrates how integrated agricultural and health interventions leveraging local production can appeal to diverse stakeholders as an acceptable approach to improve IYCF.

PY  - 2015
AB  - This paper examines the literature on how biodiversity contributes to improved and diversified diets in developing countries. We assess the current state of evidence on how wild and cultivated biodiversity in all forms is related to healthy diets and nutrition, and examine how economic factors, knowledge and social norms interact with availability of biodiversity to influence both production and consumption choices. The paper identifies areas where evidence is lacking and ways to build synergies between nutrition-sensitive approaches and efforts to ensure sustainability of food systems and the natural environment.

TI  - The negative side of the agricultural–nutrition impact pathways: A literature review
PY  - 2015
AB  - Agricultural development interventions and policies have an impact on the nutrition of individuals through changes in food availability, in food diversity, in food prices, and changes in farmers' income. Less straightforward, they also entail many changes in health environment and in time availability for care activities. They finally have impacts on the balance of power both at the intra-household, community, and global levels. The impact pathways are complex and interlinked, and many recent studies have primarily focused on their positive effects. However, some agricultural interventions might have a negative impact on nutrition in certain cases. This article sets out to identify them, through a review of the scientific and institutional literature, along with expert interviews. Six risk categories are proposed, relative to incomes, prices, types of products, women's social status and workload, the health environment, and inequalities. This review underlines the necessity to have an ex ante analysis of the nutrition impacts of any food or agricultural policy or intervention with “do not harm approach” regarding the nutrition outcomes. It gives clues to identify and mitigate the main negative outcome and advocate for more applied and well-documented research on that topic. (Resume d'auteur)

TI  - Factors influencing participation dynamics in research for development interventions with multi-stakeholder platforms: A metric approach to studying stakeholder participation.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Multi-stakeholder platforms have become mainstream in projects, programmes and policy interventions aiming to improve innovation and livelihoods systems, i.e. research for development interventions in low- and middle-income contexts. However, the evidence for multi-stakeholder platforms' contribution to the performance of research for development interventions and their added value is not compelling. This paper focuses on stakeholder participation as one of the channels for multi-stakeholder platforms' contribution to the performance of research for development interventions, i.e. stakeholder participation. It uses a quantitative approach and utilizes descriptive statistics and ARIMA models. It shows that, in three Ugandan multi-stakeholder platform cases studied, participation increased both in nominal and in unique terms. Moreover, participation was rather cyclical and fluctuated during the implementation of the research for development interventions. The study also shows that, in addition to locational and intervention factors such as type of the area along a rural-urban gradient targeted by the intervention and human resources provided for multi-stakeholder platform implementation, temporal elements such as phases of research for development intervention objectives and the innovation development process play significant roles in influencing participation. The study concludes that contribution of multi-stakeholder platforms to the performance of research for development projects, programs, policies and other initiatives is constrained by locational and temporal context and conditional on the participation requirements of the objectives pursued by research for development intervention.

TI  - Women's empowerment and their experience to food security in rural Bangladesh.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Global discourses have advocated women's empowerment as a means to reduce their own's food insecurity, which is also key development challenges in Bangladesh. However, little empirical research has conducted on this issue, especially in the rural area of Bangladesh. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine the relationship of six domains of women's empowerment with their food security in rural Bangladesh using a partial least square structural equation modelling approach. Our empirical analysis indicates that women's accesses to their legal and familial rights and decision-making roles in households increase their bargaining power over the utilization of resources and to choices of food which significantly and negatively decrease their food insecurity. Moreover, information and communication technologies and infrastructure facilities also negatively and significantly associated with women's food insecurity. However, women's leadership has a negative but not significant effect on their food insecurity, as low self-esteem rural women feel no ease in publicly addressing their inequalities. By understanding family composition from women's perceptions, the results from our research can assist policymakers to develop more suitable strategies to enhance the empowerment status of rural women and reduce their food insecurity.

TI  - Aid for food security: does it work?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to existing literature by examining whether development aid has any measurable impact on food security, whether the impact is conditioned on the quality of governance and whether it differs based on the type of aid provided. Design/methodology/approach – Panel-data analysis of 85 developing countries between 1994 and 2011, using generalized method of moments and two-stage least squares estimators. Findings – The paper finds that aid in general has a small positive impact on food security; that multilateral aid, grants and social and economic aid have a positive effect on food security in their own right, and that bilateral aid, loans and agricultural aid are more conditioned on the quality of governance that other aid. Research limitations/implications – The main limitations rest with the imperfect nature of cross-country data on food security and governance, which I have tried to overcome through a series of robustness tests. Practical implications – T...

TI  - Health Impact Assessment of Urban Agriculture in Kampala
PY  - 2010
AB  - While the Urban Harvest-supported studies described in the previous three chapters were going on in Kampala, an opportunity arose to complement them with an exploration of the health impacts associated with urban agriculture (UA) in the city. The Kampala City Council had expressed concern about the health risks associated with some forms of UA and the research team welcomed the chance to examine ways to reduce health risks and increase health benefits. A parallel research process was therefore set up, governed by a Health Coordinating Committee comprising researchers and policy-makers. Scholars from universities and research institutes in Uganda and Canada, in collaboration with local government and non-governmental organizations, were supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). This chapter is essentially a summary of a companion book titled “Healthy City Harvests: generating evidence to guide policy on urban agriculture”, which contains all these studies (Cole et al. 2008). As in that book, the research findings are translated into policy implications, not only for Kampala but also for other cities with similar conditions.

TI  - Linking agriculture and nutrition education to improve infant and young child feeding: Lessons for future programmes.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Agriculture and food systems play a central role in nutrition by supplying nutritious, healthy and affordable foods. When integrated with nutrition education for behaviour change, agricultural interventions that supply diverse affordable foods from all food groups have great scope for improving young child and family diets. In 2014, process reviews were conducted in Cambodia and Malawi of food security projects that provided agricultural support and community-based nutrition education on improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF). In both countries, household visits were carried out with mothers/caregivers, and interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposively selected project stakeholders (53 in Cambodia, 170 in Malawi), including government staff from the agriculture and health sectors. Results highlight that adoption of improved IYCF practices was facilitated by participation in nutrition education and practical cooking sessions, and supportive family and community structures. Barriers faced by families and caregivers were identified, such as women's workload and lack of access to high quality foods, namely fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and animal source foods. Implementation challenges regarding coordination of cross-sectoral targeting strategies and capacities of extension services to sustain community-based IYCF nutrition education need to be addressed to improve programme effectiveness and impact. The project lessons from Cambodia and Malawi are useful for integrated agriculture-IYCF nutrition education programmes to help ensure better young child nutrition outcomes.

TI  - Transitioning Toward Nutrition-Sensitive Food Systems in Developing Countries
PY  - 2017
AB  - A nutrition-sensitive food system is one that goes beyond staple grain productivity and places emphasis on the consumption of micronutrient-rich nonstaples through a variety of market and nonmarket interventions. A nutrition-sensitive approach not only considers policies related to macrolevel availability and access to nutritious food, but it also focuses on household- and individual-level determinants of improved nutrition. In addition to agriculture, intrahousehold equity, behavior change, food safety, and access to clean water and sanitation are integral components of the food system. This article provides a detailed review, from an economic perspective, on the multisectoral pathways through which agriculture influences nutrition. A critical challenge is to identify and implement food and nutrition policies that are appropriate to the particular stage of structural transformation in the country of concern.

TI  - Food, Agriculture and Small Farmers in Asia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Food demand, an increasingly urban consumer base, food safety and risks of disease transference from domestic livestock, define much of the fundamentals for development in Asia. Food security for the populous region relies on small farmers, continuous research breakthroughs and an appreciation of the integrated nature of development, which in turn provides a broad understanding of the intent behind the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Agriculture’s impact on the natural environment in meeting food demand, sometimes misunderstood to have been avoidable, forms part of the ongoing research focus that seeks to balance human and environmental well-being. As the major source of basic food production, small farmers with diverse food outputs support their own lifestyles in rural regions, and thereby reduce the rate of urban poverty growth, while also providing marketable surpluses. This chapter argues that a holistic view of development indicates that food security continues as it has through history to be central to good governance, which ipso facto renders reliance on free trade in food to be a risk for food-importing nations. Continual reliance on research has become more critical with an increased global awareness of the link between food deficits and migration, and with the poorly appreciated decline in international research spending specific to developing nations. The lead in such research and development is shifting to China and India, yet much still focuses on large-scale production. Research which focuses on small farmers is catered for through the efficient if underfunded Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which has made substantial contributions to world stability and food through innovations across agricultural intensification, environmental sustainability, market reform, food safety and zoonotic disease mitigation. The chapter concludes that where food and nutritional security are responsibly managed, population-induced environmental degradation decreases and opportunities for other developments are created such as conservation, education, health and gender equity.

TI  - Time-Use Analytics: An Improved Way of Understanding Gendered Agriculture-Nutrition Pathways
PY  - 2018
AB  - There is a resurgence of interest in time-use research driven, inter alia, by the desire to understand if development interventions, especially when targeted to women, lead to time constraints by increasing work burdens. This has become a primary concern in agriculture-nutrition research. But are time-use data useful to explore agriculture-nutrition pathways? This study develops a conceptual framework of the micro-level linkages between agriculture, gendered time use, and nutrition and analyzes how time use has been conceptualized, operationalized, and interpreted in agriculture-nutrition literature on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The paper argues that better metrics, but also conceptualizations and analytics of time use, are needed to understand gendered trade-offs in agriculture-nutrition pathways. In particular, the potential unintended consequences can be grasped only if the analysis of time use shifts from being descriptive to a more theoretical and analytical understanding of time constraints, their trade-offs, and resulting changes in activity.

TI  - The impact of agricultural input subsidies on food and nutrition security: a systematic review
PY  - 2018
AB  - Agricultural input subsidies, a form of social protection, are often considered an important means of improving agricultural productivity in low- and middle-income countries. However, their effectiveness and efficiency remains contentious with respect to productivity, economic and consumer welfare measures, as well as food and nutrition security. This is exacerbated by a weak evidence base, including no review focused on the impact of agricultural input subsidies on food security and nutrition. Further, where studies have considered nutritional outcomes of agricultural input subsidy interventions, this has often been in regard to changes in consumption of the targeted staple food, measured in terms of calorie consumption or a similar measure of changes in energy availability, ignoring other aspects of malnutrition, including impacts from dietary diversity. This wider consideration of impacts from dietary diversity is important, given the increasing recognition in nutrition policy of its importance. We address this gap in the literature with a review of the evidence on the impact of agricultural input subsidy programmes on nutrition and nutrition-related health in low- and middle-income countries, mapping this evidence against a conceptual framework of the mediating pathways.

TI  - Beliefs, knowledge, and values held by inner-city youth about gardening, nutrition, and cooking
PY  - 2007
AB  - Changes in the US food system and an interest in changing dietary habits among youth have impelled numerous schools and communities to develop programs such as community gardens. Youth community gardens have the potential to positively influence dietary behaviors and enhance environmental awareness and appreciation. However, actual data supporting youth gardening and its influence are limited. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of community gardens on youth dietary behaviors, values and beliefs, and cooking and gardening behaviors. Focus groups were conducted with inner-city youth living in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota and compared those involved in a youth garden program with those uninvolved in order to investigate whether the gardening program influenced their habits, beliefs, and values. Findings indicate that youth garden program participants were more willing to eat nutritious food and try ethnic and unfamiliar food than those not in the program. Additionally, it was apparent that garden participants had a stronger appreciation for other individuals and cultures and were more likely to cook and garden on their own than youth not involved in a garden program. The findings suggest that garden programs positively impact youth garden habits, food choice, social skills, nutrition knowledge, and cooking skills.

TI  - The impacts of agroforestry interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees or other woody perennials with crops or livestock in production systems, is being widely promoted as a conservation and development tool to help meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social‐ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well‐studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence‐based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives. Objectives The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well‐being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub‐groups of the population. Search Methods This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well‐being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid‐2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review. Selection Criteria We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi‐experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well‐being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade‐grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before‐after comparison. Data Collection and Analysis We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta‐analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta‐analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta‐analysis were discussed narratively. Main Results We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi‐experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low. Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta‐analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g = 1.16 [−0.35, 2.67] (p = .13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 98.99%, τ 2 = 2.94, Q(df = 4) = 370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta‐analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g = 0.12 [−0.06, 0.30] (p = .20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 75.29%, τ 2 = 0.04, Q(df = 6) = 19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub‐groups, including differential impacts on small‐holders versus large‐holders, on woman‐headed households versus male‐headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small‐holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design. Authors' Conclusions There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio‐economic factors in determining suitable intervention design. Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi‐experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time‐periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices.

TI  - Forest Conservation: A Potential Nutrition-Sensitive Intervention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries
PY  - 2020
AB  - Childhood undernutrition yearly kills 3.1 million children worldwide. For those who survive early life undernutrition, it can cause motor and cognitive development problems that translate into poor educational performance and limited work productivity later in life. It has been suggested that nutrition-specific interventions (e.g., micronutrient supplementation) that directly address the immediate determinants of undernutrition (e.g., nutrient intake) need to be complemented by nutrition-sensitive interventions that more broadly address the underlying determinants of undernutrition (e.g., food insecurity). Here, we argue that forest conservation represents a potentially important but overlooked nutrition-sensitive intervention. Forests can address a number of underlying determinants of undernutrition, including the supply of forest food products, income, habitat for pollinators, women’s time allocation, diarrheal disease, and dietary diversity. We examine the effects of forests on stunting – a debilitating outcome of undernutrition – using a database of household surveys and environmental variables across 25 low- and middle-income countries. Our result indicates that exposure to forest significantly reduces child stunting (at least 7.11% points average reduction). The average magnitude of the reduction is at least near the median of the impacts of other known nutrition interventions. Forest conservation interventions typically cover large areas and are often implemented where people are vulnerable, and thus could be used to reach a large number of the world’s undernourished communities that may have difficult access to traditional nutrition programs. Forest conservation is therefore a potentially effective nutrition-sensitive intervention. Efforts are needed to integrate specific nutrition goals and actions into forest conservation interventions in order to unleash their potential to deliver nutritional benefits.

TI  - Effect of nutrition education and dairy group membership on nutrition knowledge, practices and diet quality for rural Kenyan farm women
PY  - 2017
AB  - The typical high-starch, low diversity diet in developing countries is associated with undernutrition, morbidity and mortality. Previous research with households in Mukurwe-ini Division (Central Kenya) found that members of a community-based dairy development group were more food secure and had higher intake of certain micronutrients compared with non-members; however, the prevalence of inadequate intake of multiple micronutrients was high among all women. A nutrition education intervention was developed to enhance women’s nutrition knowledge and food skills to ultimately improve diet quality and micronutrient intakes for women and their families. In addition, it was proposed that the intervention effects would be greater for dairy group members. The Mukurwe-ini study group consisted of 88 women in four dairy membership-duration categories (n=4 x 22) and non-member women (n=23). The study group was previously selected using chain referral sampling. For the intervention, women from each duration-group and non-member women were randomly allocated to intervention (n=55) and control (n=56) groups. Nutrition knowledge and dietary intake (24-hour recall) data were collected from all women over three weeks immediately prior to the intervention (baseline) and again, six months post-intervention, in individual face-to-face interviews. The intervention encouraged food-based strategies to improve intake of vitamin A, iron and zinc and was developed and delivered in collaboration with a Kenyan dietitian. WFood2 was used to compute food and nutrient intakes, dietary diversity and the phytate:zinc molar ratio. Descriptive statistics and linear and logistic regressions analyses were performed using Stata10. Independent of dairy-group membership, a larger proportion of intervention group women, compared to control group women, had the targeted nutrition knowledge and practiced the strategies to improve intake of vitamin A (76% vs 67%, respectively) and zinc and iron (soaked beans and maize 80% vs 13%; avoided tea with meals 67 % vs 5%, respectively). A positive effect of the intervention on dietary diversity was dependent on dairy-group membership status. Positive intervention effects on intake of vitamin A and C were found for non-member women. This study provided evidence that certain intervention effects were dependent on poverty reduction and that all women were able to make positive dietary changes when informed. There is a need to examine longerterm impacts of nutrition education interventions and to explore effective methods to disseminate nutrition information and food-based strategies. Key words : nutrition intervention, micronutrients, food-based strategy, rural, women, dairy, smallholder farmer

TI  - Intergenerational participatory discussion groups foster knowledge exchange to improve child nutrition and food security in northern Malawi.
PY  - 2009
AB  - This article assesses the effectiveness of a participatory, intergenerational, dialogue approach in addressing gender and generational conflicts related to both child nutrition and agriculture. Analysis of 46 interviews and 3 focus groups with smallholder farmers in rural agrarian communities with high rates of child malnutrition in northern Malawi suggested that participatory discussion can lead to positive change, including increasing child feeding frequency and dietary diversity. An intergenerational, transformative, and holistic approach to nutrition education which integrates agricultural and gender issues can effectively address sensitive conflicts within households and communities that affect child nutrition, and come up with local solutions.

TI  - Informing infant and young child feeding programming in humanitarian emergencies: An evidence map of reviews including low and middle income countries.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Around 200 million people were affected by conflict and natural disasters in 2015. Whereas those populations are at a particular high risk of death, optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices could prevent almost 20% of deaths amongst children less than 5 years old. Yet, coverage of interventions for improving infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices in emergencies is low, partly due to lack of evidence. Considering the paucity of data generated in emergencies to inform programming, we conducted an evidence map from reviews that included low- and middle-income countries and looked at several interventions: (a) social and behavioural change interpersonal and mass communication for promoting breastfeeding and adequate complementary feeding; (b) provision of donated complementary food; (c) home-based fortification with multiple micronutrient powder; (d) capacity building; (e) cash transfers; (f) agricultural or fresh food supply interventions; and (g) psychological support to caretakers. We looked for availability of evidence of these interventions to improve IYCF practices and nutritional status of infants and young children. We identified 1,376 records and included 28 reviews meeting the inclusion criteria. The highest number of reviews identified was for behavioural change interpersonal communication for promoting breastfeeding, whereas no review was identified for psychological support to caretakers. We conclude that any further research should focus on the mechanisms and delivery models through which effectiveness of interventions can be achieved and on the influence of contextual factors. Efforts should be renewed to generate evidence of effectiveness of IYCF interventions during humanitarian emergencies despite the challenges.

TI  - Implementation and scale-up of nutrition-sensitive agriculture in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review of what works, what doesn't work and why
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evidence is rapidly growing on the impact pathways through which nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) contributes to improving nutritional outcomes. However, to harness NSA's full potential, it is equally important to understand why impacts are achieved (or not) and which factors play a role. Evidence on success and failure factors as well as external barriers and facilitators that influence the implementation and scale-up of NSA in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is still limited. To address this gap, we reviewed empirical evidence (since 2000) on factors influencing NSA implementation and scale-up. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the analysis and synthesis of this systematic review. Eighty-five studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and synthesized across the five domains of the CFIR; here we report findings from three of the domains: NSA interventions, inner setting and outer setting. Many factors related to each of the domains were identified: intervention-specific factors (clustered in seven sub-domains and 23 themes), local contextual factors (in six sub-domains and 23 themes), and factors related to the broader enabling environment (in five sub-domains and 12 themes). A strong interplay among factors across the three domains was observed. This review highlights key areas for attention to enhance the success of NSA programs: learning from past successes and failures; appropriateness and acceptability based on context knowledge; project flexibility in addressing design limitations and coping with unforeseen hindrances; strengthening local structures, community empowerment and increasing resilience; supportive policy and governance. Our findings can help decision-makers at multiple levels to strengthen on-going/future NSA programs and anticipate possible pitfalls to maximise NSA's potential to reduce undernutrition in LMICs. • Identifying factors influencing NSA and their interplay requires a system approach. • Failure frequently arose from not having/using context knowledge, could be avoidable. • Identifying failure factors may lead to success factors if well and timely addressed. • Project planning needs flexibility to cope with unavoidable/unforeseen issues. • Achieving horizontal and vertical coherence of NSA remains problematic.

TI  - The contribution of small-scale food production in urban areas to the sustainable development goals: a review and case study
PY  - 2020
AB  - Food production depends upon the adequate provision of underpinning ecosystem services, such as pollination. Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for biodiversity.

TI  - The effect of women’s home gardens on vegetable production and consumption in Bangladesh
PY  - 2014
AB  - Home-based vegetable production has been recognized as a nutrition- and gender-sensitive intervention that has the potential to improve nutrition in developing countries, yet evidence is lacking. This study tested whether women’s training in improved home gardens (including nutrition as well as technical aspects) contributes to increased production and consumption of vegetables, which are necessary preconditions for improving nutrition. The study used data from 582 poor rural women in two districts of Bangladesh (479 control and 103 intervention). Training increased the per capita production of mostly leafy vegetables from 20 to 37 kg per year (+86 %). Diversity of production and frequency of harvesting also increased. In terms of nutrient yields, the improved gardens increased the supply of plant proteins by 171 %, iron by 284 %, vitamin A by 189 % and vitamin C by 290 %. Training had a significant impact on the diversity of vegetables consumed, based on 30-day food frequency data and also increased the relative involvement of women in the home garden for all gardening tasks. These results indicate that women’s home gardens are an effective intervention in Bangladesh for increasing the supply and consumption of a diverse range of vegetables in poor rural households, thereby contributing to nutrition security.

TI  - The contribution of agriculture to household dietary diversity: evidence from smallholders in East Hararghe, Ethiopia
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study explores the impact of agriculture production on food consumption amongst rural households in Babille district, East Hararghe, Ethiopia. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to analyse information on production, consumption and income in two consecutive seasons. Diets in the area are dominated by cereals, while consumption of high-value foods such as meat, eggs, fruits, vitamin A-rich vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables was found to be extremely limited, indicating a risk of nutrient deficiencies. Food consumption was assessed in terms of dietary diversity and frequency of consumption, expressed in terms of the household Food Consumption Score (FCS). Important differences were found between households in the same area, and between pre-harvest and post-harvest seasons. Households with adequate food consumption tended to produce greater numbers of crops, own more livestock and earn more cash income compared to households in lower food consumption categories. Nutritionally important foods such as groundnut, eggs and fruit tend to be sold via local markets, and production of a particular food type was no guarantee that household would consume that food. Households depend heavily on the market to supplement their own food production, with most household expenditure going towards the purchase of cereals. Regression analysis indicated that food consumption is positively associated with agriculture output, but also with other factors such as size of landholding and farm income. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving the dietary outcomes for farm households in developing areas such as Babille, including a reconsideration of the balance between consumption and sale of agricultural outputs, and the need for more, and better targeted, agricultural support services.

TI  - The production of provitamin A-rich vegetables in home-gardens as a means of addressing vitamin A deficiency in rural African communities
PY  - 2007
AB  - Vitamin A deficiency remains a public health problem in the developing world. The highest prevalence of vitamin A deficiency is in Africa and Asia (>30%). Dietary modification, a long-term strategy to address vitamin A deficiency, complements food fortification and vitamin A supplementation programmes. Provitamin A carotenoids from foods of plant origin are more affordable than preformed vitamin A from animal foods, and many resource-poor households rely on yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits and dark-green leafy vegetables as their main source of vitamin A. The provitamin A carotenoid content in plant foods varies widely and differences among cultivars of the same food exist. Several factors influence the bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids. The potential contribution of plant foods to vitamin A status depends on the retention of provitamin A carotenoids after storage, preparation and processing. Home-gardens can provide households with direct access to provitamin A-rich vegetables that are not readily available or within their financial reach. The components and critical issues of home-garden projects are described. Copyright © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - ¿A quién benefician los programas de salud dirigidos a los más pobres? Éxitos y fracasos. Informe SESPAS 2008
PY  - 2008
AB  - Resumen Los programas de cooperacion internacional en salud dirigidos a los mas pobres tienen un indudable papel constructivo al aliviar el sufrimiento humano agudo, pero resultan contraproducentes y hasta lesivos si oscurecen la necesidad de eliminar las inequidades sociales, que son la causa primaria de las inequidades en salud. El objetivo de este articulo es revisar la efectividad de dos programas estatales que recibieron ayuda de la cooperacion, el primero en mejorar la seguridad alimentaria de los hogares rurales y los grupos vulnerables urbanos en Colombia (1996-2005), y el segundo en desarrollar un sistema local de salud en la zona Norte de San Salvador, El Salvador (1992-1997). La cooperacion internacional apoya programas asistenciales exitosos, como los de complementacion alimentaria, que podrian generar dependencias a los beneficiarios. Ademas, factores externos a la cooperacion (contexto de intereses politicos- economicos) influyen en los programas que apoyan, y pueden generar conflictos sociales. Es el caso del apoyo a programas de los mas pobres para la promocion de su salud en El Salvador, o de mejora de las condiciones de acceso a los alimentos mediante la produccion para el autoconsumo en zonas rurales de Colombia, pues benefician la produccion agraria exportable, propiedad de los mas ricos, pero no al pequeno agricultor.

TI  - Bridging barriers to advance multisector approaches to improve food security, nutrition and population health in Nepal : transdisciplinary perspectives
PY  - 2019
AB  - Understanding stakeholders’ perceptions is crucial to the development and implementation of any intervention. However, a structured approach to eliciting stakeholder insights into complex, multisector issues of food security, household environment and health is lacking in many low and middle-income countries. This qualitative, workshop-based participatory study explores stakeholders’ experiences of developing and implementing multisector interventions to provide transdisciplinary lessons for future developments in low and middle-income countries. Participants were purposely selected based on their involvement in, or exposure to, the multisector intervention. Participants with interests in agriculture, nutrition, household air-quality, drinking water-quality and health from academic institutes, government and developmental organisations were brought together at a one-day workshop to participate in a series of discussions on issues relating to food security, nutrition, household environment and health in Nepal. All group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed, and a thematic qualitative analysis performed to identify relevant themes. The government’s ongoing Multisector Nutrition Plan, stakeholders’ willingness to work together, availability of local infrastructure for cross-institutional inputs and increasing global movement towards transdisciplinary approaches were identified by the 33 workshop participants, representing 23 organisations as key factors determining success of transdisciplinary work. Fragmentation, lack of research-based and practice-based evidence, limited transdisciplinary knowledge amongst sectoral stakeholders, short-term funding and lack of knowledge-sharing mechanisms were identified as barriers, often creating systematic problems for successful implementation. Stakeholders suggested methods to bring about success included: improved knowledge, both amongst policy-makers and implementers, of food security and its linkage with nutrition, household environments, health and hygiene; investment in collaborative practice-based research and evidence-based practice; and strengthened transdisciplinary collaboration between multi-stakeholders, such as researchers, implementers and beneficiaries, throughout the intervention development and implementation process. This study suggests that multisector approach needs to adapt to take into account the experiences and views of the stakeholders concerned. The paper offers recommendations for successful development and implementation of future multisector interventions in Nepal that can be extrapolated to other low and middle-income countries, and lays foundations for future transdisciplinary working to support realisation of the recommendations.

TI  - Improving women's nutrition imperative for rapid reduction of childhood stunting in South Asia: coupling of nutrition specific interventions with nutrition sensitive measures essential.
PY  - 2016
AB  - The implications of direct nutrition interventions on women's nutrition, birth outcome and stunting rates in children in South Asia are indisputable and well documented. In the last decade, a number of studies present evidence of the role of non-nutritional factors impacting on women's nutrition, birth outcome, caring practices and nutritional status of children. The implications of various dimensions of women's empowerment and gender inequality on child stunting is being increasingly recognised. Evidence reveals the crucial role of early age of marriage and conception, poor secondary education, domestic violence, inadequate decision-making power, poor control over resources, strenuous agriculture activities, and increasing employment of women and of interventions such as cash transfer scheme and microfinance programme on undernutrition in children. Analysis of the nutrition situation of women and children in South Asia and programme findings emphasise the significance of reaching women during adolescence, pre-conception and pregnancy stage. Ensuring women enter pregnancy with adequate height and weight and free from being anemic is crucial. Combining nutrition-specific interventions with measures for empowerment of women is essential. Improvement in dietary intake and health services of women, prevention of early age marriage and conception, completion of secondary education, enhancement in purchasing power of women, reduction of work drudgery and elimination of domestic violence deserve special attention. A range of programme platforms dealing with health, education and empowerment of women could be strategically used for effectively reaching women prior to and during pregnancy to accelerate reduction in stunting rates in children in South Asia.

AB  - Agriculture has the potential to improve dietary diversity through farm production diversity if farming households consume what they produce. However, the linkages between a household’s own agricultural production and dietary diversity are not well understood. This study uses a count of crop species, animal species, production diversity score, and the Simpson’s index as measures of farm production diversity to assess the effect of production diversity on the dietary diversity of households, women and children. A Poison model was employed on a sample of 779 farming households selected using a multistage sampling technique in a household survey representative at the County level in Kisii and Nyamira Counties, Kenya. The findings of the study indicate that farm production diversity is significantly associated with the dietary diversity of women and that of the entire household, but is not associated with the dietary diversity of children. The count of the animal species has the highest magnitude of association with dietery diversity in this study. Every additional animal species kept leads to a 0.33 and 0.13 increase in household dietery diversity and the dietery diversity of women respectively. Children’s dietary diversity is significantly associated with the education of the mother, household size and age of the child. The study highlights the need to consider individual dietary requirements when developing nutrition interventions and policy, as opposed to general dietary interventions targeting the entire household.

TI  - A large-scale intervention to introduce orange sweet potato in rural Mozambique increases vitamin A intakes among children and women
PY  - 2011
AB  - β-Carotene-rich orange sweet potato (OSP) has been shown to improve vitamin A status of infants and young children in controlled efficacy trials and in a small-scale effectiveness study with intensive exposure to project inputs. However, the potential of this important food crop to reduce the risk of vitamin A deficiency in deficient populations will depend on the ability to distribute OSP vines and promote its household production and consumption on a large scale. In rural Mozambique, we conducted a randomised, controlled effectiveness study of a large-scale intervention to promote household-level OSP production and consumption using integrated agricultural, demand creation/behaviour change and marketing components. The following two intervention models were compared: a low-intensity (1 year) and a high-intensity (nearly 3 years) training model. The primary nutrition outcomes were OSP and vitamin A intakes by children 6-35 months and 3-5·5 years of age, and women. The intervention resulted in significant net increases in OSP intakes (model 1: 46, 48 and 97 g/d) and vitamin A intakes (model 1: 263, 254 and 492 μg retinol activity equivalents/d) among the younger children, older children and women, respectively. OSP accounted for 47-60 % of all sweet potato consumed and, among reference children, provided 80 % of total vitamin A intakes. A similar magnitude of impact was observed for both models, suggesting that group-level trainings in nutrition and agriculture could be limited to the first project year without compromising impact. Introduction of OSP to rural, sweet potato-producing communities in Mozambique is an effective way to improve vitamin A intakes.

TI  - Community-based interventions for enhancing access to or consumption of fruit and vegetables among five to 18-year olds: a scoping review
PY  - 2012
AB  - Low fruit and vegetable ( FV) consumption is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Consumption of FV is limited by a lack of access to FV. Enhanced understanding of interventions and their impact on both access to and consumption of FV can provide guidance to public health decision-makers. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and map literature that has evaluated effects of community-based interventions designed to increase FV access or consumption among five to 18-year olds.

TI  - Agriculture programs impacting food security in two HIV/AIDS-affected Kenyan and Zambian communities
PY  - 2009
AB  - HIV/AIDS is one of the most devastating health concerns of the developing world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To address individual food insecurity and malnutrition, numerous small-scale nutrition and agriculture interventions have been implemented. This study compared the CTC Community Garden Project in Maai Mahiu, Kenya (n=15) and the HelpMercy Nutrition and Food Security Project (seed distribution) in Macha, Zambia (n=64), after one year. Study objectives included assessing food security in Maai Mahiu, determining beneficiaries‘ perceived usefulness of the interventions, comparing and evaluating the interventions, determining the importance of education in the interventions, and making recommendations for improvement. A survey in Maai Mahiu used a modified FAST tool to determine food security for beneficiaries (n=15) and non-participants (n=50). The majority of respondents were determined food insecure (without hunger), indicating a need for improved access to food/land. To determine outcomes and make comparisons, intervention outcome and beneficiary perceived usefulness‘ were measured using two verbally administered surveys, two focus groups, and two interviews with translation. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrated differences between beneficiary perceptions of the interventions. No association was observed between perceived usefulness of the two studies (χ 2 ). A backward elimination logistic regression model of the HelpMercy intervention showed that attendance at communitybased nutrition and agriculture education sessions (CBES), household size, and number of seed types planted were predictors of perceived usefulness. Households who attended at least one CBES were more likely to perceive the intervention as useful (χ 2 for trend, p=0.007), and there was a linear relationship between number of CBES attended and perceived usefulness (MannWhitney, p=0.008). Results may support research that agriculture interventions are more effective when combined with nutrition education. Perceived barriers and benefits differed significantly between the two programs. 60.3% of HelpMercy beneficiaries and 40.0% of CTC beneficiaries perceived the interventions as useful. Program improvements are possible, and further research is needed to better understand the impact and potential benefits of small-scale nutrition and agriculture interventions for HIV-affected populations in SSA.

TI  - Constraints and opportunities for implementing nutrition-specific, agricultural and market-based approaches to improve nutrient intake adequacy among infants and young children in two regions of rural Kenya.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Several types of interventions can be used to improve nutrient intake adequacy in infant and young child (IYC) diets, including fortified foods, home fortification, nutrition education and behaviour change communication (BCC) in addition to agricultural and market-based strategies. However, the appropriate selection of interventions depends on the social, cultural, physical and economic context of the population. Derived from two rural Kenyan populations, this analysis combined information from: (1) a quantitative analysis to derive a set of food-based recommendations (FBRs) to fill nutrient intake gaps in IYC diets and identify 'problem nutrients' for which intake gaps require solutions beyond currently available foods and dietary patterns, and (2) an ethnographic qualitative analysis to identify contextual factors posing opportunities or constraints to implementing the FBRs, including perceptions of cost, convenience, accessibility and appropriateness of the recommended foods for IYC diets and other social or physical factors that determine accessibility of those foods. Opportunities identified included BCC to increase the acceptability and utilisation of green leafy vegetables (GLV) and small fish and agronomic interventions to increase the productivity of GLV and millet. Value chains for millet, beans, GLV, milk and small fish should be studied for opportunities to increase their accessibility in local markets. Processor-level interventions, such as partially cooked fortified dry porridge mixes or unfortified cereal mixes incorporating millet and beans, may increase the accessibility of foods that provide increased amounts of the problem nutrients. Multi-sectoral actors and community stakeholders should be engaged to assess the feasibility of implementing these locally appropriate strategies.

TI  - The agriculture-nutrition disconnect in India: what do we know?
PY  - NA
AB  - India is home to one-third of the world’s malnourished children. This figure that remains stubbornly high, despite the country having the second-fastest growing economy in the world, with agriculture accounting for a significant part of that growth. Agriculture continues to be the primary source of livelihood for the majority of nutritionally vulnerable households in India. In order to maximize the nutrition-sensitivity of agriculture, we need to first map existing evidence of the various links, pathways and disconnects between agriculture and nutrition. We start with a narrative review of the background literature for India, including an assessment of trends in nutrition and agriculture indicators. A conceptual framework is then put forward to aid in the systematic search for links and disconnects, delineating seven key pathways between agriculture and nutrition. Evidence is then mapped to these pathways through a summary of the literature for each pathway as well as a fully annotated bibliography. A data audit assesses gaps and overlaps in survey data containing information on agriculture and nutrition indicators, on which future analyses could be built. Overall, the authors find that the conceptual framework is useful in this process, and conclude that there are some significant gaps in the literature and in the data currently available to analyze linkages between agriculture and nutrition. Data and policy disconnects need to be bridged to enhance the nutrition sensitivity of agriculture in India.

TI  - Ensuring the Supply of and Creating Demand for a Biofortified Crop with a Visible Trait: Lessons Learned from the Introduction of Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato in Drought-Prone Areas of Mozambique
PY  - 2007
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is a promising biofortified crop for sub-Saharan Africa because it has high levels of provitamin A carotenoids, the formed vitamin A is bioavailable, and white-fleshed sweet potato is already widely grown. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether farmers will adopt varieties with a distinct visible trait, young children will eat OFSP in sufficient quantities to improve vitamin A intake, OFSP can serve as an entry point for promoting a more diversified diet, and lessons can be drawn to assure sustained adoption. METHODS: The 2-year quasi-experimental intervention study followed households and children (n = 741; mean age, 13 months at baseline) through two agricultural cycles in drought prone-areas of Mozambique. RESULTS: OFSP is acceptable to farmers when introduced by using an integrated approach. In the second year, intervention children (n = 498) were more likely than control children (n = 243) to have consumed OFSP (54% vs. 4%), dark-green leaves (60% vs. 46%), or ripe papaya (65% vs. 42%) on 3 or more days in the previous week (p < .001 for all comparisons). Their vitamin A intakes were nearly eight times higher than those of control children (median, 426 vs. 56 1g RAE [retinol activity equivalents], p < .001). Diet diversification was limited by difficult agroecological conditions and low purchasing power. However, dietary diversity was higher among intervention than control children (32% vs. 9% consuming food from more than four groups; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated OFSP-based approach had a positive impact on the vitamin A intake of young children. A market development component and improved vine multiplication systems are recommended to assure sustained adoption.

TI  - Influence of agriculture on child nutrition through child feeding practices in India: A district-level analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Malnutrition continues to be a primary concern for researchers and policymakers in India. There is limited scientific research on the effect of agriculture on child nutrition in the country using a large representative sample. To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the spatial clustering of child malnutrition and its linkage with agricultural production at the district-level in the country. The present study aims to examine agricultural production's role in improving the nutritional status of Indian children through child feeding practices. The nutritional indicators of children from the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) and the agricultural production data for all the 640 districts of India obtained from the District-Wise Crop Production Statistics (2015-16), published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India were used for the analysis. The statistical analysis was undertaken in STATA (version 14.1). ArcMap (version 10.3), and GeoDa (version 1.8) were used for the spatial analysis. The study found a higher prevalence of malnutrition among children who had not received Minimum Meal Frequency (MMF), Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD), and Minimum Acceptable Diet (MAD). Further, child feeding practices- MMF, MDD, and MAD- were positively associated with high yield rates of spices and cereals. The yield rate of cash crops, on the contrary, harmed child feeding practices. Production of pulses had a significant positive effect on MDD and MAD. Districts with high cereal yield rates ensured that children receive MMF and MAD. There is a significant spatial association between child feeding practices and malnutrition across Indian districts. The study suggests that adopting nutrient-sensitive agriculture may be the best approach to improving children's nutritional status.

TI  - Population-attributable risk estimates for factors associated with inappropriate complementary feeding practices in The Gambia.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Objective The present cross-sectional study aimed to determine population-attributable risk (PAR) estimates for factors associated with inappropriate complementary feeding practices in The Gambia. Design The study examined the first and most recent Demographic and Health Survey of The Gambia (GDHS 2013). The four complementary feeding indicators recommended by the WHO were examined against a set of individual-, household- and community-level factors, using multilevel logistic analysis. PAR estimates were obtained for each factor associated with inappropriate complementary feeding practices in the final multivariate logistic regression model. Setting The Gambia. Subjects Last-born children (n 2362) aged 6-23 months. Results Inadequate meal frequency was attributed to 20 % (95 % CI 15·5 %, 24·2 %) of children belonging to the youngest age group (6-11 months) and 9 % (95 % CI 3·2 %, 12·5 %) of children whose mothers were aged less than 20 years at the time of their birth. Inadequate dietary diversity was attributed to 26 % (95 % CI 1·9 %, 37·8 %) of children who were born at home and 20 % (95 % CI 8·3, 29·5 %) of children whose mothers had no access to the radio. Inadequate introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods was attributed to 30 % (95 % CI 7·2 %, 38·9 %) of children from poor households. Conclusions Findings of the study suggest the need for community-based public health nutrition interventions to improve the nutritional status of Gambian children, which should focus on sociocultural and economic factors that negatively impact on complementary feeding practices early in infancy (6-11 months).

TI  - Gender Issues in Human, Animal and plant health using an Ecohealth Perspective
PY  - 2015
AB  - The ecohealth approach is a core concept integrating environmental aspects with human and animal health (domestic and wild animals). Zoonotic and emerging diseases affect human health and impact negatively on food security. Although both the risk of contracting a disease and the subsequent impacts vary between different genders, age groups, cultures and social conditions, very little research has been done on this and few guidelines or interventions focus adequately on these aspects. This paper is based on a conceptual framework identifying the relationship between gender inequalities and the risk of contracting a disease in an ecohealth perspective. It looks at the varying impacts of plant, animal and human diseases and identifies four contributing factors. This paper first discusses the socially defined roles including social, economic, cultural, legal and political factors that often determine which place men and women occupy in society, which animals and plants men or women have accumulated knowledge of, which they have control of and which they benefit from and consequently the impact men and women have on the environment due to these specific roles. Secondly, it analyses the gender differences in risk of infection. It also analyses cultural differences that influence practices connected to animal, plant and human diseases and discusses respective preventions and treatments. Thirdly, it also identifies the ways men and women are impacted by the diseases of human, plants and animals in different ways. Lastly, this paper assesses the biological factors that influence the differences in exposure, infection rates and mortality rates between men and women during their life cycle. These four factors contribute to gender variations in relation to animal, human, plant and ecological health.

TI  - An Integrated Education Intervention Improves the Feeding Frequency of Infants and Young Children in the Upper Manya Krobo District of Ghana
PY  - 2017
AB  - Childhood malnutrition is partly due to inappropriate complementary feeding (CF) practices. The effect of two education interventions on young child feeding practices was evaluated in the Upper Manya Krobo district of Ghana. A total of 32 child growth monitoring centers were randomly assigned to either of two intervention groups [integrated nutrition and agriculture education (IE) or nutrition education (NE)], or the control (CT) group. Over six months, mothers of children 6-24 months old in both intervention groups received monthly nutrition education delivered by community health volunteers; additionally, mothers in the IE group received agricultural education from extension agents. Information on complementary feeding practices and dietary intakes of study children were collected at baseline and at three-month intervals for nine months. Intention-to-treat analysis was complemented by a sub-sample analysis to determine the effect of attendance to education sessions on outcomes. At the end of the study, children in the IE were twice as likely to meet the minimum meal frequency compared to the CT children (aOR = 2.62; 95% CI; 1.11, 6.16), but energy, calcium, and iron intakes from complementary foods did not differ between the three groups. Additionally, children of mothers who attended at least one nutrition education session in the IE group tended to receive the minimum acceptable diet (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI; 0.98, 5.39, p = 0.055) compared to children in the CT group at the end of the study. Compliance to the intervention was low, with almost half of intervention mothers (45%) never attending an education session. A combined agriculture and nutrition education led to improved meal frequency among young children in the Upper Manya Krobo district of Ghana. Thus, this is one of the strategies that can be used to address sub-optimal complementary feeding practices in rural areas, where farming is a major source of employment.

TI  - Conceptual Links between Landscape Diversity and Diet Diversity: A Roadmap for Transdisciplinary Research
PY  - 2020
AB  - Malnutrition linked to poor quality diets affects at least 2 billion people. Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are key sources of dietary diversity in rural settings. In the present article, we develop conceptual links between diet diversity and forested landscape mosaics within the rural tropics. First, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests, trees, and agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in bolstering dietary diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build a framework illuminating four pathways (direct, agroecological, energy, and market pathways) connecting forested landscapes to diet diversity. Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining knowledge gaps related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly simplistic views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional synergies with forest conservation and restoration.

TI  - Organized Homegardens Contribute to Micronutrient Intakes and Dietary Diversity of Rural Households in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2019
AB  - A greater diversity of crops grown in homegardens in Sri Lanka is thought to be positively associated with increased nutritional diversity of the diet of members of households and their improved nutritional status and health. However, no studies have been made to evaluate the quantitative contribution of homegardens to people’s food and nutrient intake and security. Here we report three studies to test an improved homegarden production system, with agricultural and extension interventions, designed for the mid-country wet zone in Sri Lanka. The study assessed the impact of the improved system on crop type diversity, on dietary intake and diversity and food and nutritional security of the households. In Study 1, 100 households with homegardens were evaluated for their household characteristics and homegarden practices. Study 2 was on a sub sample of 20 households each with organized homegardens (OHG); households were provided with planting material, agricultural inputs and advice, and were regularly monitored by a field officer for methodical farming. These improved home gardens were contrasted with non-organized homegardens (NOHG; without intervention) to measure crop diversity through a simple species count. Study 3 assessed 25 sample households with OHG and 20 households with NOHG: dietary nutrient intake and diversity and household food security were quantified. Family food consumption was assessed using a 5-day diet diary. Perceived household food security status was determined using United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Nutrient intakes, dietary adequacy and contribution to dietary diversity from produce derived from homegarden were calculated. A total of 149 crop species were recorded in the homegardens with a 14% greater diversity in OHG than NOHG. Household food security was not significantly associated with organized or non-organized homegardens. The improved, organized home gardens provided diets with a greater contribution of energy, carbohydrates, fat, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, thiamin, niacin, vitamin C and vitamin A compared with NOHG. The study demonstrates that households with OHG had greater dietary diversity from homegarden produce compared with that of households with NOHG leading to better food and micronutrient intake and nutritional security.

TI  - Gender Role in Agricultural Technology: A Case of Rural Bangladesh
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>This study analyzed the gender role in agricultural activities with respect to the change of technologies and determine their implications for improvement of household status in Netrokona district. The study followed the simple random sampling technique to select 300 sample respondents for household survey through the semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive analysis such as, number and percentages, was used. Multiple regressions used in order to explore the relationship between the income and other factors. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques were utilized. Women perception index (WPI) was measured using rank ordered approach. The findings showed that there has been significant change occurred with the livestock rearing activities which are 116.79% after adoption in new technology. According to this study, male are involved in decision making in the following activities as reported by the respondents: sale of produce (84%), purchase and repair (78%), weed control (70%), land preparation (76%), spraying (65%) and planting (51%), where women respondents reported that they are mostly involves in harvesting 89%, processing 81%, manuring 48% and weed control 59%. Our research also shows that 78% and 73% of men have owned small equipment and thresher, Ox-plough, and power tiller where women own only 21 percent, 2 percent, and 5 percent respectively. It is evident that the perception regarding farming with adoption of new technology attain highest score and 2nd highest ranked perception is technical training on technology, similarly the 3rd ranked occupied is adoption in HYV where last rank score on use of indigenous technology. It means that most of them prefer modern technology in terms of productivity. The experience on modern technology of respondents has a positive coefficient and it was 0.492. Given these facts, our research has explained what keeps women’s rates of modern agricultural technology adoption low.</jats:p>

TI  - Agricultural production diversity and child nutrition in Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study investigates how two aspects of agricultural production diversity – farm production diversity and composition of production – relate to child height-for-age and weight-for-height in Ethiopia. We use longitudinal data on child anthropometric measurements, household farm production diversity and farm production composition from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey for 2011, 2013, and 2015 available through the World Bank. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we show that an increase in farm production diversity reduces the risk of chronic food insecurity (child height-for-age) but has no impact on acute measures of food insecurity (child weight-for-height). Results also suggest that, in a context of poor rainfall, more diversity in farm production can adversely impact child height-for-age, although livestock sales might mitigate that detrimental effect. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between farm-level food production and child nutrition in a context of climate change.</jats:p>

TI  - How to do a good systematic review of effects in international development: a tool kit
PY  - 2012
AB  - We provide a ‘how to’ guide to undertake systematic reviews of effects in international development, by which we mean, synthesis of literature relating to the effectiveness of particular development interventions. Our remit includes determining the review's questions and scope, literature search, critical appraisal, methods of synthesis including meta-analysis, and assessing the extent to which generalisable conclusions can be drawn using a theory-based approach. Our work draws on the experiences of the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation's (3ie's) systematic reviews programme.

TI  - The contribution of urban community gardens to food availability in Emfuleni Local Municipality, Gauteng Province
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study investigated the contribution of urban community gardens to food availability in Emfuleni Local Municipality, Gauteng Province of South Africa. The objectives were to determine the ability of the urban community gardens to produce vegetables throughout the year and to assess the contribution of these gardens to food availability. It was conducted in six (6) townships of Emfuleni Local Municipality by means of semi-structured survey questionnaires. A sample of 254 participants was randomly drawn from 418 urban farmers. A descriptive analysis technique and one-way ANOVA formed part of the data analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. The study found that community gardens contributed to food availability of the respondents by providing fresh vegetables to most urban farmers and their household members throughout the year. Furthermore, it was discovered that there is no relationship between vegetable availability and gender of the respondents. Based on the results, the study recommended that farmers in urban community gardens should focus on increasing and sustaining their production to ensure that they have adequate vegetables to feed their families throughout the year.

TI  - Farming for change: developing a participatory curriculum on agroecology, nutrition, climate change and social equity in Malawi and Tanzania
PY  - 2019
AB  - How to engage farmers that have limited formal education is at the foundation of environmentally-sound and equitable agricultural development. Yet there are few examples of curricula that support the co-development of knowledge with farmers. While transdisciplinary and participatory techniques are considered key components of agroecology, how to do so is rarely specified and few materials are available, especially those relevant to smallholder farmers with limited formal education in Sub-Saharan Africa. The few training materials that exist provide appropriate methods, such as compost making, but do not explain relationships and synergies between nutrition, social inequalities, climate change and agroecology. Some food sovereignty and agroecology courses aim at popular political education for those with more formal education. Here we describe the process of development of an innovative curriculum, which integrates agroecology, nutrition, climate change, gender and other dimensions of social equity across 2 weeks of training explicitly for smallholders in southern Africa with limited formal education. The curriculum is highly participatory; we use concepts in popular education, transformative and experiential-based learning, and theatre. It is also integrative; we link agroecology with climate change, human and soil nutrition, gender, and related components of social equity. Developed in partnership with Malawian farmers, community development experts and academics from five countries, the curriculum was piloted with 520 smallholder farming households in Malawi and Tanzania, and evaluated using qualitative techniques. Clashes of language, cultural norms, and terminology were as great of a challenge as agreeing on and conveying technical information, to weave into a coherent whole. However, farmers who participated in the curriculum training demonstrated high interest, comprehension of material and interest in immediate application to their lives.

TI  - PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH ON LEGUME DIVERSIFICATION WITH MALAWIAN SMALLHOLDER FARMERS FOR IMPROVED HUMAN NUTRITION AND SOIL FERTILITY
PY  - 2007
AB  - SUMMARY Legume species are uniquely suited to enhance soil productivity and provide nutrient-enriched grains and vegetables for limited-resource farmers. Yet substantial barriers to diversification with legumes exist, such as moderate yield potential and establishment costs, indicating the need for long-term engagement and farmer-centered research and extension. This review and in-depth analysis of a Malawian case study illustrates that farmer experimentation and adoption of legumes can be fostered among even the most resource-poor smallholders. Multi-educational activities and participatory research involving farmer research teams was carried out with 80 communities. Over five years more than 3000 farmers tested legumes and gained knowledge of legume contributions to child nutrition and soil productivity. The average area of expansion of legume systems was 862 m 2 in 2005; 772 m 2 for women and 956 m 2 for men indicating a gender dimension to legume adoption. Farmers chose edible legume intercrops such as pigeonpea and groundnut over the mucuna green manure system, particularly women farmers. Interestingly, expansion in area of doubled-up edible legumes (854 m2 in 2005) was practiced by more farmers, but was a smaller area than that of mucuna green manure system (1429 m 2 ). An information gap was discovered around the biological consequences of legume residue management. Education on the soil benefits of improved residue management and participatory methods of knowledge sharing were associated with enhanced labour investment; 72 % of farmers reported burying legume residues in 2005 compared to 15 % in 2000. Households reported feeding significantly more edible legumes to their children compared with control households. Participatory research that incorporated nutritional education fostered discussions within households and communities, the foundation for sustained adoption of legume-diversified systems.

TI  - Commercially viable agriculture and consumption of nutritious foods: a framework for identifying development pathways : A desk review
PY  - 2018
AB  - Food systems in low and middle income countries are changing rapidly in response to economic and market developments, environmental impacts, and dietary changes. Within this context, informed policy and sustainable development processes are needed to shape climate-smart and resilient food systems for food and nutrition security at farming household level. This research project aimed to a) explore the complexity of the contextual dynamics in which smallholder farming households operate; and b) contribute to a better conceptual understanding of commercial food production strategies in relation to consumption choices. A literature review was conducted, exploring both scientific and grey literature, in parallel to consultation rounds with a multidisciplinary team of agronomists, economists, nutritionists and international development specialists to explore existing insights, align available expertise, and find common ground on how to create a useful framework that would fit the specific interests and expertise of each of the actors involved. Key elements for our framework were preliminary drawn from existing frameworks. A number of - non-exclusive - pathways were identified. These include subsistence-oriented production for the household’s own consumption (source of food), whereby women – as producers as well as care takers - are seen as the crucial agents for household food security and health outcomes; production for sale in markets (source of income); and agricultural policies (national and global), affecting a range of supply and demand factors that establish the price of marketed food and non-food crops (food price policies). The important characteristics for the framework for viable commercial agriculture and consumption of nutritious foods evolve around different aggregation levels: the individual (gender and power dynamics), the household (household food production, income generation, food purchase choices, care practices, access to health care), the community (employment opportunity, collaboration, microfinance, care and social (infra)structure), and the regional/nation (price and trade policy) level.

TI  - Associations between livestock keeping, morbidity and nutritional status of children and women in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Livestock keeping can positively influence the nutritional status of populations and households through increased consumption of animal-source foods (ASF) and other indirect pathways, but can also adversely affect health by increasing the risk of diseases. We conducted a systematic review synthesising the current state of knowledge on the associations among livestock keeping, infectious disease and the nutritional status of children under 5 years and women of reproductive age in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). A comprehensive search of 12 electronic databases and grey literature sources published from 1991 to the end of December 2020 was conducted. Investigations exploring relationships between livestock keeping and risk of infectious disease transmission and nutritional status were selected using pre-defined inclusion criteria. After screening and filtering of 34,402 unique references, 176 references were included in the final synthesis. Most (160/176, 90.1%) of the references included in the final synthesis were from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Asia. About two out of every five (42%) studies reviewed showed that livestock production is associated with improved height-for-age <i>Z</i> scores (HAZ) and weight-for-length/height <i>Z</i> scores (WHZ), while close to a third (30.7%) with improved weight-for-age <i>Z</i> scores (WAZ). Similarly, livestock production showed a positive or neutral relationship with women's nutritional status in almost all the references that reported on the topic. Conversely, four-fifths (66/81, 79.5%) of the references reporting on infection and morbidity outcomes indicated that livestock keeping is linked to a wide range of infectious disease outcomes, which are spread primarily through water, food and insects. In conclusion, in many LMIC settings, livestock production is associated with better nutritional outcomes but also a higher risk of disease transmission or morbidity among women and children.This review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO 2020 [CRD42020193622].

TI  - More than subsistence: Small-scale urban agriculture and household livelihoods in Havana, Cuba
PY  - 2010
AB  - In the past 20 years, Cuba has emerged as a world leader in urban agriculture and sustainable development, having shifted its policies and practices toward local, organic food production and self-sufficiency. This collective case study explored small-scale, unwaged urban agriculture and household livelihoods in Havana, Cuba. Data were collected from three case households through participant observation, in-depth interviews, and photos. Two of the families produce fruits, vegetables and animal products, and the third produces organic fertilizers. For these families, agricultural production requires time and labour, but produces multiple material and non-material benefits at the individual, household, and community level. The findings demand a more nuanced view of household livelihoods and agency in the Cuban context, and the notion of agriculture as work vs. leisure. As global concerns about resource depletion and social justice in food systems increase, much can be learned from families and countries that have successfully implemented alternatives.

TI  - Navigating structural barriers to the implementation of agriculture-nutrition programs in Nepal
PY  - 2020
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programs hold substantial promise for improving access to nutritious food in contexts like rural Nepal. Yet, implementing such programs in geographically and culturally diverse settings can be challenging. To better understand the contextual factors that influence the ability of program participants to benefit from agriculture-nutrition interventions, we qualitatively examined the implementation of Helen Keller International’s Homestead Food Production program (HFP) in far-western Nepal. Data collection consisted of shadowing program staff for three months, interviewing program participants (n = 31) and staff (n = 10), and conducting three focus-group discussions with female community health volunteers (n = 28). An integrated food and nutrition system framework guided thematic analysis. Participants demonstrated high levels of knowledge about the program’s nutrition messages and expressed interest in and motivation to engage in the HFP program. However, access to water, land, and time determined the extent to which their full participation in the program was feasible. Factors within the biophysical and sociocultural environments interacted to influence access to these crucial resources. Some program participants and staff provided examples of ways in which they overcame these contextual constraints. These included investing in micro-irrigation equipment, arranging land-sharing agreements, and demonstrating more equitable gender norms. Successfully implementing nutrition-sensitive agriculture requires addressing context-specific structural barriers, particularly when aiming to benefit the most vulnerable. Long-term solutions to the barriers faced by the most marginalized households will require broad structural changes. However, problem-solving strategies used by program participants and staff also point towards immediate actions that programs can take to expand the potential for marginalized households to fully participate.

TI  - The Contribution of Forests and Trees to Sustainable Diets
PY  - 2013
AB  - With the growing demands from a population expected to reach 9 billion people by 2050, it is unclear how our current global food system will meet future food needs. Ensuring that all people have access to adequate and nutritious food produced in an environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. ―Sustainable diets‖ have been proposed as a multidimensional framework to address the need for nutritious and adequate food in the context of the many challenges facing the world today: reducing poverty and hunger, improving environmental health, enhancing human well-being and health, and strengthening local food networks, sustainable livelihoods and cultural heritage. This paper examines the contribution of forests and trees to sustainable diets, covering among others, nutritional, cultural, environmental and provisioning aspects. The literature reviewed highlight major opportunities to strengthen the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets. However, several constraints need to be removed. They relate to: cultural aspects, sustainable use of non-wood forest products, organization of forest food provisioning, limited knowledge of forest food composition, challenges in adapting management of forests and trees to account for forest foods, and in integrating forest biodiversity into complex landscapes managed for multiple benefits. Finally, the paper identifies research

TI  - An empirical analysis of aspects of food security in Zimbabwe
PY  - NA
AB  - At the World Food Summit held in Rome in 1996, world leaders reaffirmed the right of each and every individual to have access to safe and nutritious food and to be free from hunger. The quest since then has been to halve the hungry population by 2015. To this effect, various measures aimed at improving food availability, accessibility, utilisation and stability at individual, national and global levels have been taken. Currently, capacity building interventions are being promoted as a more sustainable way of improving food security. Capacity building projects encourage the beneficiaries to utilise locally available resources to improve their food security. Whilst progress has been evident in other regions, regions like South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are still lagging behind. A challenge thus remains of alleviating hunger in these two regions as the deadline for the attainment of the goal of halving the hungry population is fast approaching. This thesis analyses various aspects of food security in Zimbabwe, a country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Firstly, the relationship between short-term (BMI-for-age) and long-term (height-for-age) child health is assessed for children below the age of five years. Secondly, the contribution of maternal nutrition (denoted by the mother’s BMI) towards a child’s short-term nutrition (denoted by the child’s BMI z-score) is explored. Thirdly, this thesis assesses the merits of a capacity building project, the Smallholder Drip Irrigation Project, in alleviating household food insecurity in Mutasa and Mutoko districts of Zimbabwe. Two areas are examined; the determinants of dropout rates from and the duration a beneficiary lasts in smallholder drip irrigation projects and whether the project’s main goal of improving household food security was achieved. This thesis adds to existing literature on the relationship between short-term and long-term child health by using the Demographic and Health Survey data to assess this relationship for a poor country, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s main challenge is that of underweight children as opposed to overweight children who have been the focus of most of the studies on the relationship between BMI and height. The results show that there is a robust negative relationship between BMI-for-age and height-for-age for children below the age of 5 years. This means that taller children (better long-term health) are more likely to be underweight (poor short-term health). In terms of policy, this result implies that targeting food insecure children using the BMI-for-age measure, as is the current practice will result in the selection of children with better long-term health. For Zimbabwe, the prevalence of stunting (low-height-for-age) compared to being underweight (low BMI-for-age) is higher. Thus if BMI-for-age is used, some children with poor long-term health may be left out. Policies aimed at targeting the food insecure should therefore consider incorporating the height-for-age measure as part of their targeting criteria. Existing literature on the impact of maternal BMI on a child’s BMI mostly incorporates maternal BMI as an explanatory variable for child health. This thesis adds to the existing literature by modelling this relationship for using a nationally representative dataset from the Demographic and Health Survey. In addition, potential endogeneity or simultaneity bias arising from unobservable household factors that affect both the mother and the child’s BMI is accounted for. The results reveal that maternal BMI has both a direct and indirect positive influence on a child’s BMI. This implies that programs aimed at improving maternal nutrition for mothers who are not pregnant or lactating will also directly improve the child’s nutrition. So in addition to existing programs targeting the nutrition of pregnant and lactating mothers, nutrition based programs for other mothers with children below the age of 5 will be beneficial to both the mother and the child. Very little literature is available on the merits of capacity building projects in improving food security. For the smallholder drip irrigation project implemented on a large scale in Zimbabwe, available literature points out that dropout rates were quite high. This thesis adds to the literature by using data from the Smallholder Drip Irrigation Survey (conducted by the author) to examine why beneficiaries dropped out of the project. In addition the thesis also explores the factors that influence the duration a beneficiary lasts in the drip irrigation project. The results obtained indicate that timing of receipt of the drip kit, yield increases in vegetables and better socio-economic status significantly reduce chances of dropping out of the project and increase the time the beneficiary remains in the project. On the other hand, yield increases, experiencing water problems and the beneficiary’s age increase chances of dropping out of projects and have a negative impact on the duration a beneficiary lasts in the project. These results can be incorporated in improving the implementation of smallholder drip irrigation projects as well as other capacity building projects in Zimbabwe. The results of this thesis also suggest that the main impact of the smallholder drip irrigation program on household food security in Mutasa and Mutoko districts was through a reduction in the number of coping strategies used by the household. Dropping out had no significant impact on a household’s dietary diversity score, in spite of the project aiming to increase household food diversity.

TI  - Lessons from the old Green Revolution for the new: Social, environmental and nutritional issues for agricultural change in Africa
PY  - 2012
AB  - Recent efforts for an 'Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa' (AGRA) promote fertilizer, hybrid seeds, pesticides and biotechnology to increase agricultural production. This article examines the original Green Revolution to understand potential effects of a recent promotion of related technologies in Africa. Using a case study of Malawi, the implications of promoting high- input, intensive agriculture on food security, social relations and nutrition are considered. I argue that unless social inequalities and environmental concerns are taken into account, these technolo- gies will intensify inequalities, increase environmental degradation and exacerbate malnutrition for the rural majority, while benefi tting the urban poor, larger-scale farmers, agro-input dealers and transnational corporations involved in agribusiness.

TI  - Vegetable Diversity, Productivity, and Weekly Nutrient Supply from Improved Home Gardens Managed by Ethnic Families - a Pilot Study in Northwest Vietnam
PY  - 2019
AB  - Assess to quality diets is a basic human right. Geographical challenges and cultural traditions have contributed to the widespread malnutrition present among ethnic minorities of mountainous areas in Northwest Vietnam. Home gardens can play a role in increased diet diversity and micronutrient intakes. However, low production yields and plant diversity in ethnic home gardens have limited their contributions to household food security and nutrition. The pilot study tested a home garden intervention in weekly vegetable harvests and increasing household production and consumption of diverse vegetables year-round. Food ethics issues encountered included limited access to quality food by resource-poor groups, conflicts arising from low preference and value given to some nutritious foods, limited access to information and technology for food production and consumption, each of which were addressed in the study design. The intervention includes: (1) nutrition-focused home garden training and (2) locally-adapted home garden packages consisting of garden planning, technical assistance, and high-yielding seed varieties. Twenty households from two ethnic villages in Son La province participated in the study and were randomly assigned into two groups (intervention and non-intervention). The total vegetable supply from weekly harvests of home garden produce was significantly higher in the intervention households (226 kg) compared to the non-intervention households (39 kg). The intervention group yielded 5.8 and 1.7 times more vegetables by weight and weight per area than those without the intervention. The vegetables were mainly consumed at home for both groups, but the intervention households gave more vegetables as gifts to neighbors. The intervention group cultivated a higher diversity of vegetables with a total of 42 different vegetables compared to 24 in the non-intervention group, which is reflected in an overall higher nutritional yield of vitamin A, iron, other micronutrients and phytochemicals. The home garden training significantly improved the amount, diversity and continuity of household food and nutrient supply. The home garden model is effective and could be scaled up to improve household vegetable supply and consumption, particularly in Northwest Vietnam.

TI  - The Value in Community Gardens: A Return on Investment Analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Food production in cities is increasingly regarded as one of the building blocks for sustainable urban living, particularly as the agricultural industry faces mounting ecological and economic constraints, and populations continue to concentrate in urban centers. While substantial research exists on the qualitative outcomes of urban agriculture (UA), few studies present these outcomes in monetary terms that align with municipal decision makers economic priorities. In response to this gap, this paper reviews the literature on potential outcomes of one form of UA—community gardens—and identifies where gaps exist which prevent the translation of garden outputs into an economic quantity. The paper then describes a pilot return on investment assessment of a community garden in Ontario, Canada. Substantial data constraints were encountered, however the limited available data indicate that community gardens may represent an ROI-positive government investment. Further local-level research quantifying garden impacts would enable a more robust case for community gardens in cities.

AB  - The hypothesis underlying this review paper is that how irrigation gets deployed in SSA will be decisive not only for environmental sustainability (such as deciding remaining forest cover in the region) and poverty reduction, but also for health, nutrition, and gender outcomes in the region. The focus of this paper is on the health, nutrition, and gender linkage.

TI  - Does Market Access Mitigate the Impact of Seasonality on Child Growth? Panel Data Evidence from Northern Ethiopia
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractSeasonality in agricultural production continues to shape intra-annual food availability in low-income countries. Using high-frequency panel data from northern Ethiopia, this study attempts to quantify seasonal fluctuations in children’s weights. Consistent with earlier studies, we document considerable seasonality in children’s age and height adjusted weights. While children located closer to local food markets are better nourished compared to their counterparts residing farther away, their weights are also subject to considerable seasonality. Further analysis shows that children located closer to food markets consume more diverse diets than those located farther away but the content of the diet varies across seasons. This leads us to conclude that households located near these food markets are not able to insulate their children from seasonal weight fluctuations. We discuss some policy options with potential to address this threat to child wellbeing.

TI  - Repackaging Agricultural Research for Greater Impact on Agricultural Growth in Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - Despite the enormous research activities embarked upon by the various research entities in Africa over time, the expected research impacts remain obscure. This paper is a compilation of facts and figures from published peer reviewed articles, agricultural research and development reports from national and international institutions, and base-line data from the Africa Rice Centre aimed at elucidating the performance of agricultural research in Africa between 1960 and 2010. It discusses the constraints to the visible impact of agricultural research on the growth of Africa’s economy, and suggests how to repackage agricultural research for more visible impact on Africa’s economic growth. Results show that agricultural research has been beneficial for African agriculture widely and is believed to be the backbone of the economic growth of the continent. Agricultural research has also served as the bedrock of agricultural technological transformation to enhance agricultural growth. Research has helped to increase agricultural production and productivity and food security in several countries. Also, investment in agricultural research has yielded positive impact on poverty reduction and food security. However, food security and poverty are still visibly mining the African population. The major constraints in the utilization of agricultural research results are the lack of adequate public investment in agriculture, lack of well-trained researchers, inadequate research infrastructures and poor management of the agricultural research and development system. Findings show that in order to package agricultural research for visible impact on the economy, agricultural research systems would need to be adequately funded and handled by skilled human resources under good governance. An effective innovative agricultural policy would demand the initial acknowledgment that a break from the past is necessary to ‘produce more and better’ in Africa and that successful agricultural research systems should be designed in a framework of co-construction, co-execution and co-evaluation.

TI  - An Assessment of the Impact of Agricultural Research in South Asia since the Green Revolution
PY  - 2008
AB  - The post-Green Revolution period has seen profound changes in the economic situation in South Asia and evolving challenges for the agricultural RD increasing the productivity and quality of high-value crops, trees, and livestock; agricultural intensification in many less favored areas; more precise targeting of the problems of the poor, including enhancing the micronutrient content of food staples; and analysis of policy and institutional options for achieving more sustainable and pro-poor outcomes in the rural sector. This study draws on the available literature to assess how successful the agricultural R&D system has been in achieving these new goals in South Asia. Overall, it finds that the R&D system has responded well to these changing needs in terms of both budgetary allocations and the kinds of research that has been undertaken. Moreover, market liberalization has enabled a more diverse set of agents to engage in agricultural R&D, and private firms and NGOs have helped ensure that important research and extension needs have not been overlooked. Findings on the impact of this evolving research agenda are mixed. The economic returns to crop improvement research have remained high and well in excess of national discount rates. Public investments in crop improvement research have also given higher returns than most other public investments in rural areas. There is little credible evidence to suggest that these rates of return are declining over time. Agricultural R&D has also made important contributions to reducing poverty in South Asia, but it has done less well in reducing interhousehold and interregional inequities. The greatest impact on poverty has been obtained by lowering food prices, but this pathway might be less important in the future now that food prices are aligned more with border prices and food accounts for a smaller share of consumers' budgets. Also, given that agriculture now plays a relatively small part in the livelihoods of many marginal farmers in South Asia, questions arise about the efficacy of continuing to target agricultural R&D to their problems. Agricultural R&D has also been successful in addressing many of the environmental problems associated with agriculture, with a demonstrated potential for favorable impacts in farmers' fields. Yet the uptake of improved technologies and management practices that reduce environmental damage has been disappointing, particularly in intensively farmed areas. Finally, a large amount of policy research has been undertaken in South Asia since the GR, and case studies show favorable returns to policy research, though the conditions under which it leads to policy change are not well understood.

TI  - Pressure cooker ownership and food security in Aurangabad, India
PY  - 2011
AB  - Objective: To explore associations between household food security and home gardening, use of soya and pressure cooker ownership in low-income households affected by HIV/AIDS in Aurangabad, India. Design: Cross-sectional pilot study which assessed household food security using the validated US Department of Agriculture’s food security core-module questionnaire. Questions were added to explore household environment, education, occupation, home gardening, use of soya and pressure cooker ownership. Households with very low v. low food security were compared using logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding by socio-economic status. Setting: Aurangabad is an urban setting situated in a primarily agricultural dependent area. The study was carried out in 2008, at the peak of the global food crisis. Subjects: Adult caregivers of children affiliated with the Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Aurangabad. Results: All except for one of 133 households were identified as food insecure (99?2 %). Of these households, 35?6 % had to cut size or skip a meal in the past 30 d. Households that cut meal size due to cooking fuel shortages were more likely to have very low food security (OR 5 4?67; 95 % CI 1?62, 13?44) compared with households having no cooking fuel shortages. Owning a pressure cooker was shown to be protective against very low food security after controlling for confounding by socio-economic status (OR 5 0?27; 95 % CI 0?11, 0?64). Conclusions: Only pressure cooker ownership showed a protective association with low household food security. Pressure cookers save household fuel costs. Therefore, future interventions should explore pressure cookers as a sustainable means of improving household food security.

TI  - Does Fish Farming Improve Household Nutritional Status? Evidence from Bangladesh.
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the present study, nutritional status was assessed using dietary diversity of fish and non-fish farming households in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. It has determined the incidence of poverty in fish and non-fish farm households through a comparative analysis of family profile, food consumption, calories, and protein intake. A total of 420 farms were selected for data collection using structured questionnaires with 210 fish and 210 non-fish farm families. The study using both descriptive and functional analysis revealed that the respondent age of both farms was 45.10 years, family size was 5.70, average education was 4.64 schooling years, and average farm size was 0.514 hectares. As a result, due to the increase in household income, fish farm families improved their food consumption, calories, and protein intake in comparison with non-fish farms. On a direct calorie intake (DCI) basis, the overall absolute and hardcore poverty levels of fish farm households were 32 percent and 18 percent, respectively, while those of non-fish farm households were 22 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Therefore, the incidence of poverty was higher in non-fish farming families than in fish farming families. In principle, provision of various forms of government assistance through the Department of Fisheries (DOF) will further intensify and strengthen fish farming, which will easily bring fallow and uncultivated lands of the area under fish farming. Moreover, it is possible to inspire the younger generation through this research that will help them to become a fish farm-based entrepreneur. The main conclusion of the present study is that fish farming is more positively related to household income, family food intake, and nutritional status than any other type of farming.

TI  - The Effects of Household Food Production Strategies on the Health and Nutrition Outcomes of Women and Young Children: A Systematic Review
PY  - 2012
AB  - The objective of this review is to systematically examine and summarise the effects of agricultural interventions to increase household food production on the nutrition and health outcomes of women and young children and provide recommendations for future research and programming. Data from all studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria were abstracted into a standardised form. The quality of the evidence was assessed and graded using a modified version of the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation technique. Thirty-six articles, representing 27 unique projects were identified. Of these 32 and 17 reported on the health and nutrition outcomes of children and women, respectively. Although studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analysis, agricultural strategies consistently reported significantly improved diet patterns and vitamin A intakes for both women and children. Although some individual studies reported significant reductions in child malnutrition, summary estimates for effects on stunting [relative risk (RR) 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84, 1.04]], underweight (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.60, 1.07]) and wasting (RR 0.91 [95% CI 0.60, 1.38]) were not significant. Findings for an effect on vitamin A status, anaemia and morbidity were inconsistent. Overall the evidence base for the potential of agricultural strategies to improve the nutrition and health of women and young children is largely grounded in a limited number of highly heterogeneous, quasi-experimental studies, most of which have significant methodological limitations. While household food production strategies hold promise for improving the nutrition of women and children, the evidence base would be strengthened by additional research that is methodologically robust and adequately powered for biological and dietary indicators of nutrition.

TI  - Gender and conservation agriculture in East and Southern Africa: towards a research agenda
PY  - 2015
AB  - It is remarkable that despite wide-ranging, in-depth studies over many years, almost no conservation agriculture (CA) studies consider gender and gender relations as a potential explanatory factor for (low) adoption rates. This is important because CA demands new ways of working with the farm system. Implementation will inevitably involve a reallocation of men's and women's resources as well as having an impact upon their ability to realize their gender interests. With respect to intra-household decision-making and the distribution of benefits, CA interventions have implications for labour requirements and labour allocation, investment decisions with respect to mechanization and herbicide use, crop choice, and residue management. CA practice may impact upon the ability of households to source a wide variety of crops, wild plants, and insects and small animals for household nutrition. Gender biases in extension service design can sideline women. This paper examines the limited research to date on the inter...

TI  - Diversify, produce or buy? An analysis of factors contributing to household dietary diversity among shrimp and non-shrimp farmers in coastal Bangladesh.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Bangladesh had reported consistent improvements regarding its food and nutrition security (FNS) status, and yet, the country still features poor FNS outcomes among parts of its population. In rural coastal regions of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, farming households' vulnerability is particularly exacerbated by a range of environmental hazards, increasing challenges for agriculture to contribute to higher FNS levels. In the context of existing literature on the trade-offs between subsistence agriculture and cash-earning livelihood activities, vis-à-vis food and nutrition security outcomes, this article assesses the relative contribution of crop diversification vis à vis other factors on the households' Food Consumption Score (FCS) in specific livelihood contexts. We provide differentiated analyses between primarily export-oriented shrimp farming and non-shrimp farming households, so policy makers can better address FNS targets. Quantitative data from 1,188 sample households across the delta were analysed through descriptive and linear regression analyses. Results show that households cultivating shrimp have a significantly higher dietary diversity than households that do not. Among shrimp farmers, crop diversification has the relatively strongest significant positive effect on dietary diversity, suggesting part of the aquacultural crops are geared towards subsistence. By contrast, crop diversification seems to have a negative effect on dietary diversity among households that do not produce shrimp, especially when different agricultural crops are combined. Importantly, both for shrimp and non-shrimp farmers, crop diversification systems combining agriculture with aquaculture, and agroforestry seem to improve diverse diets among households. While by no means a panacea to solving FNS challenges among rural households, we suggest that promoting specific crop diversification systems could be a beneficial pathway to improved FNS outcomes.

TI  - The challenge of achieving basal energy, iron and zinc provision for home consumption through family farming in the Andes: a comparison of coverage through contemporary production systems and selected agricultural interventions
PY  - 2016
AB  - Child undernutrition is persistently high in the central Andes of Peru, and numerous smallholder households fail to meet their basic needs of energy, iron and zinc. Food-based approaches assume household-level nutrition can be improved following agricultural interventions. This study assesses for the first time whether current Andean production systems provide sufficient energy, iron and zinc output to meet household-level requirements and explores the likely effect of commonly promoted food-based approaches. Across four communities, we determined the crop and livestock production output for each household (n = 165) during one growing season. The household-level nutritional demand or input was calculated as a function of household composition and daily requirements of energy, iron and zinc as established by FAO/WHO. We examined five scenarios, current practice or status quo and four food-based interventions: (1) increased potato yield, (2) introduced biofortified potatoes, (3) promotion of guinea pigs and (4) a mixed strategy combining all of the above. Under status quo, 86, 62 and 76 % of households obtained sufficient production output to meet energy, iron and zinc requirements, respectively. Considering the three parameters simultaneously, 59 % of households were able to meet their energy, iron and zinc requirements. The total crop production among households provided more than the necessary energy, iron and zinc output to meet the demand of all 165 households. Yet, significant differences between households account for individual deficits or surpluses in household-level output–input balances. Potato (Solanum spp.), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and faba (Vicia faba) production was particularly significant in determining the energy, iron and zinc output. Livestock did not make a substantial contribution. The main difference between households with negative versus positive coverage, in terms of household-level production output from agriculture meeting demand (=input), was available cropping area given household size. None of the explored food-based interventions closed the energy, iron and zinc deficit from production among households with negative coverage. The smallholder production systems analyzed are only partially capable of providing sufficient production output to cover household-level energy, iron and zinc demands. Of the four interventions examined, a mixed strategy holds most potential for reducing nutrition gaps. Particularly potato yield increases had a positive effect. The carrying capacity of high-altitude Andean farming systems is strained for households with limited land. Food-based approaches to nutrition under scenarios similar to those reported in this study are advised to balance agricultural interventions with options to enhance off-farm access to food.

TI  - Assessment of Nutritional Status and habitual dietary intake of Indian Farm Women: Evidence from a Case Study in Central India
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Background Nutritional security for women working in agriculture is one of the most serious and persisting concerns in developing countries like India. The present study surveyed the dynamics of nutritional status based on dietary intake viz. calorie, carbohydrate, protein, fat, calcium, folic acid, iron, vitamin, carotene, etc. among the farm women in central India of Madhya Pradesh. Methods A total of 225 farm women (age group of 18 to 60 years) who were engaged in agriculture activities were selected for the study. The nutritional survey was done by a personal interview on food intake by a pre-tested interview schedule and daily dietary intake. The survey questionnaire includes information on family, socio-economic status, income, education, occupation, and food habit of the farm women. In this daily dietary intake, respondents were asked to list all the foods and beverages consumed for a whole day. Results The mean age, height, weight, and BMI of the respondents were 34.93 years, 1519 mm, 49.47 kg, and 21.5, respectively. Based on different grades of nutrition, BMI results indicated that 28% were underweight, 52.4% were normal, 17.8% were overweight and 1.8% were obese. Inequality (estimated by Gini coefficient) analysis showed that there is not much variation among the nutrient intake levels across the physical status of the respondents with the exception of carotene and vitamin C. The classification and regression tree analysis indicated that with the exception of fat, the rest of the nutrients didn’t turn significant in determining the farm women’s physical status in terms of weight. The analysis of the waist-hip ratio showed that the risk of metabolic diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc.) is higher in 31–40 years’ age group women. Conclusions Overall food frequency indicated that poor intake of micronutrients in their diet according to their work activity results in poor health status. The study affirmed that the actual intake of nutrients varied significantly across the physical status of the farm women, physical activities carried out, and their monthly income level. The study also suggests a slew of policy options to overcome the nutritional gap among farm women.</jats:p>

TI  - Associations of diet quality with dairy group membership, membership duration and non-membership for Kenyan farm women and children: a comparative study
PY  - 2012
AB  - Objective To examine associations among diet quality and dairy group membership, membership duration and non-member status for women and school-aged children in rural Kenya. Design A cross-sectional survey, using chain referral sampling, was conducted and diet quality indices and prevalence of inadequate intake (PII) were estimated using the 'estimated average requirement' cut-off point method from single 24 h recalls, using a Kenyan nutrient database. PII was compared among members and non-members and among membership-duration groups. Subjects Women and children of dairy group members (n 88), across membership-duration groups (1-3, 4-6, 7-9 and 10+ years), and non-members (n 23) living among members. Setting Small farms in central Kenya. Results Members had higher energy, percentage of energy from animal-source foods and dietary diversity. Member women and children had lower PII for respectively seven and three of eleven micronutrients. Reduced PII for milk-source micronutrients was associated with membership duration for women. Many member women (38%) had inadequate vitamin A intake and 39% of member children had inadequate Zn intake. Members' PII was also high (>45%) for Fe, Ca and vitamin B12. A higher prevalence of being overweight among member women compared with non-member women suggested nutrition transition effects of higher farm productivity. Conclusions Dairy group membership was positively associated with adequate quantity and quality of diets for women and children. Long-term membership was insufficient to address micronutrient deficiencies. Understanding and addressing barriers to better diet quality and strategies to mitigate negative nutrition transition effects are needed to optimize nutritional outcomes of dairy group membership.

TI  - Determinants of household food access among small farmers in the Andes : examining the path
PY  - 2012
AB  - OBJECTIVE Household food access remains a concern among primarily agricultural households in lower- and middle-income countries. We examined the associations among domains representing livelihood assets (human capital, social capital, natural capital, physical capital and financial capital) and household food access. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey (two questionnaires) on livelihood assets. SETTING Metropolitan Pillaro, Ecuador; Cochabamba, Bolivia; and Huancayo, Peru. SUBJECTS Households (n = 570) involved in small-scale agricultural production in 2008. RESULTS Food access, defined as the number of months of adequate food provisioning in the previous year, was relatively good; 41 % of the respondents indicated to have had no difficulty in obtaining food for their household in the past year. Using bivariate analysis, key livelihood assets indicators associated with better household food access were identified as: age of household survey respondent (P = 0.05), participation in agricultural associations (P = 0.09), church membership (P = 0.08), area of irrigated land (P = 0.08), housing material (P = 0.06), space within the household residence (P = 0.02) and satisfaction with health status (P = 0.02). In path models both direct and indirect effects were observed, underscoring the complexity of the relationships between livelihood assets and household food access. Paths significantly associated with better household food access included: better housing conditions (P = 0.01), more space within the household residence (P = 0.001) and greater satisfaction with health status (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Multiple factors were associated with household food access in these peri-urban agricultural households. Food security intervention programmes focusing on food access need to deal with both agricultural factors and determinants of health to bolster household food security in challenging lower- and middle-income country contexts.

TI  - Nutritious subsistence food systems
PY  - 2007
AB  - The major subsistence food systems of the world that feed resource‐poor populations are identified and their capacity to supply essential nutrients in reasonable balance to the people dependent on them has been considered for some of these with a view to overcoming their nutrient limitations in sound agronomic and sustainable ways. The approach discusses possible cropping system improvements and alternatives in terms of crop combinations, external mineral supply, additional crops, and the potential for breeding staples in order to enhance their nutritional balance while maintaining or improving the sustainability and dietary, agronomic, and societal acceptability of the system. The conceptual framework calls for attention first to balancing crop nutrition that in nearly every case will also increase crop productivity, allowing sufficient staple to be produced on less land so that the remaining land can be devoted to more nutrient‐dense and nutrient‐balancing crops. Once this is achieved, the additional requirements of humans and animals (vitamins, selenium, and iodine) can be addressed. Case studies illustrate principles and strategies. This chapter is a proposal to widen the range of tools and strategies that could be adopted in the HarvestPlus Challenge Program to achieve its goals of eliminating micronutrient deficiencies in the food systems of resource‐poor countries.

TI  - Including marginalised voices in agricultural development processes using an ethical community engagement framework in West Bengal, India
PY  - 2021
AB  - There are both practical and ethical goals for partnering with communities in the co-production of knowledge for sustainable livelihoods. The benefits of partnering with communities include trust creation, enhanced impact, and improved sustainability of development outcomes. However, for Indigenous groups and ethnic minorities, the barriers and burdens of participation in donor-driven initiatives can be immense. We share our experiences in developing and applying an Ethical Community Engagement (ECE) framework to facilitate the inclusion of poor, marginalised women in two villages in the Bankura district of West Bengal, India. People in Hakimsinan and Chakadoba villages identify as Santhals, the largest Indigenous group in West Bengal, and are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe in the Indian constitution. The framework informed both the design of research activities and the team’s interactions with tribal communities. Trialling the framework in an agriculture intensification project that aimed to increase food availability and diversity, and by extension improve nutrition outcomes, created many opportunities to explore more sustainable and culturally appropriate production options. For participating villages, improved agriculture-nutrition links were made but only after local institutions were strengthened. For the broader partnership, the ECE approach presented multiple avenues for cross-learning. We share some of the broader challenges that presented in the course of working this way, providing reflections on the shifts we observed were necessary for the framework to be applied successfully. We conclude with a discussion on navigating the tensions and barriers that transdisciplinary science presents more broadly.

TI  - Impact of a participatory agroecological development project on household wealth and food security in Malawi
PY  - 2017
AB  - This paper presents the impacts of a participatory agroecological development project on food security and wealth levels. The Malawi Farmer to Farmer Agroecology project (MAFFA) encourages farmer experimentation, community involvement and farmer-to-farmer teaching on agroecology, nutrition and gender equity. Recent international assessments of agriculture have highlighted the urgent need for changes in farming practices in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to land degradation, high levels of food insecurity and anticipated climate change impacts. Agroecological approaches have shown great potential to address these multiple needs. Using a longitudinal panel survey data and propensity score matching to account for selection bias in project participation, we analyzed the impact of the project on household income and food security in Malawi in 2012 (Wave 1 = 1200 households) and in 2014 (Wave 2 = 1000 households). We used the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) for impact evaluation. Estimates of average treatment-effects using difference in difference methods showed that participating in MAFFA has led to a significant increase in household wealth (β = 3.54, p = 0.01) and a large reduction in food insecurity (β = −3.21, p = 0.01) compared to non-participants, after 2 years, even after accounting for covariates and selection bias. These results indicate that agroecological methods combined with farmer led knowledge exchanges can be welfare enhancing, both in terms of food security and in terms of income for family farm households. Agroecological approaches should be promoted through upscaling of farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchanges, community involvement and attention to nutrition and social equity to enhance farmer learning and household welfare benefits.

TI  - Multisectoral community development in Nepal has greater effects on child growth and diet than nutrition education alone.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Objective: To compare the impact on child diet and growth of a multisectoral community intervention v . nutrition education and livestock management training alone. Design: Longitudinal community-based randomized trial involving three groups of villages assigned to receive: (i) Full Package community development activities, delivered via women’s groups; (ii) livestock training and nutrition education alone (Partial Package); or (iii) no intervention (Control). Household surveys, child growth monitoring, child and household diet quality measures (diet diversity (DD), animal-source food (ASF) consumption) were collected at five visits over 36 months. Mixed-effect linear regression and Poisson models used survey round, treatment group and group-by-round interaction to predict outcomes of interest, adjusted for household- and child-specific characteristics. Setting: Banke, Nepal. Participants: Households ( n 974) with children aged 1–60 months ( n 1333). Results: Children in Full Package households had better endline anthropometry (weight-for-age, weight-for-height, mid-upper-arm-circumference Z -scores), DD, and more consumption of ASF, after adjusting for household- and child-specific characteristics. By endline, compared with Partial Package or Control groups, Full Package households demonstrated preferential child feeding practices and had significantly more improvement in household wealth and hygiene habits. Conclusions: In this longitudinal study, a comprehensive multisectoral intervention was more successful in improving key growth indicators as well as diet quality in young children. Provision of training in livestock management and nutrition education alone had limited effect on these outcomes. Although more time-consuming and costly to administer, incorporating nutrition training with community social capital development was associated with better child growth and nutrition outcomes than isolated training programmes alone.

TI  - Towards nutrition sensitive agriculture. Actor readiness to reduce food and nutrient losses or wastes along the dairy value chain in Uganda
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The growing search for potential approaches needed for nutrition sensitive agriculture has increased the attention given to reduction of food and nutrient losses or wastes. This study targeted the dairy sector in Uganda to empirically explore stakeholder readiness for a change toward a nutrition sensitive value chain. A survey was conducted among 246 supply chain actors about their general understanding of nutrition sensitive agriculture while making a link with food and nutrient loss or waste reduction strategies. By using lean manufacturing as a waste management approach, the theory of organizational readiness to change was applied and its constructs tested empirically to assess value chain actors’ readiness to adopt measures against losses and wastes. Findings indicate that actors are less familiar with the term nutrition sensitive agriculture, yet they actually know or do what the concept entails. In addition, we found that unmarketable dairy products are often discarded but sometimes donated to charity. Path analysis revealed that change valence and resource availability positively influence change commitment and efficacy, respectively, to adopt lean measures against losses and wastes. Multi-actor approach only had a positive effect on change commitment but not on efficacy. In summary, value chain actors are optimistic about adopting approaches to reduce food and nutrient losses or wastes as part of nutrition sensitive agriculture. Consequently, external players such as governments, academia and humanitarian agencies need to create sustainable partnerships with the food industry to implement such initiatives.

TI  - Local perspectives and context in relation to feeding practices of children under 2 years in the mountain villages of northern Thailand.
PY  - 2018
AB  - OBJECTIVE To gain an in-depth understanding of infant and young child feeding practices, accompanying beliefs and their sociocultural context in the Karen and Lua ethnic communities of northern Thailand. DESIGN A two-day workshop and thirty in-depth interviews were undertaken in June 2014. Dialogue occurred with the assistance of translators and was recorded, transcribed and translated. A detailed thematic analysis was undertaken. SETTING Northern Thai indigenous communities in which one-third of the children under 5 years of age are stunted. SUBJECTS People with various roles in the local health system and twenty-six villagers who cared for infants and young children. RESULTS Predominant breast-feeding was said to occur for 1 to 3 months but was not exclusive due to early introduction of water and/or rice. Exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months was impeded by the need for mothers to return to farming work, with the early introduction of solids enabling infants to be cared for by other family members. Low variety in complementary foods was typical during infancy, with few local foods having appropriate texture and special preparation of foods rarely described. A pervasive underlying issue is women's responsibility to labour and lack of time to care for their young children. Poverty and food insecurity also featured in participants' accounts. CONCLUSIONS In combination, women's limited time to care, poverty and food insecurity are perpetuating poor nutrition of children in early life. Agricultural solutions that are being explored should also attend to the burden of work for women.

TI  - Enjeux et dynamiques de la circulation internationale d'un modèle agricole sensible à la nutrition : compréhension par les études de transfert politique
PY  - 2013
AB  - Depuis quelques annees, on constate un positionnement accru des principales institutions et instances de l'aide internationale quant aux impacts nutritionnels que peuvent avoir les interventions agricoles. Le concept d'une "agriculture sensible a la nutrition" developpe dans ces positionnements propose un profond changement de vision dans la facon de comprendre le secteur agricole. Toutefois, si un nombre croissant d'acteurs semblent se positionner sur le sujet, de nombreuses etudes soulignent le manque d'application concrete de ce concept, ce dernier connaissant des difficultes a etre mis en œuvre au niveau des pays souhaitant lutter contre la sous-nutrition. Ce memoire de fin d'etude propose donc, a travers le cadre analytique des etudes de Transfert Politique (Policy Transfert), de s'interesser aux jeux d'acteurs ayant structure l'emergence d'un modele agricole sensible a la nutrition et ayant organise sa mise en circulation et son transfert. Le but sera ici d'organiser une reflexion autour de la nature du modele transfere, et de tenter de comprendre si la faible appropriation constate au niveau des pays peut etre inherente aux modalites dans lesquelles s'effectue ce transfert.

TI  - Improving Nutrition through Agriculture : Viewing agriculture-nutrition linkages along the smallholder value chain
PY  - 2011
AB  - This report is a synthesis of existing global knowledge on improving nutrition through agriculture using a smallholder value chain approach. The smallholder value chain model used by the desk review concentrates on both producers and consumers and is centred around three pathways: improved nutrition resulting from increased production for own consumption, improved nutrition through increased income from selling agricultural products, and improved nutrition through increased income resulting from farmers’ involvement in local or regional procurement programs. The report identifies key conditions for agricultural interventions to significantly contribute to nutrition as well as important knowledge gaps pertaining to agriculture-nutrition linkages.

TI  - The Contribution of forests to sustainable diets
PY  - 2013
AB  - 1. The potential for forest foods to contribute to food security and better nutrition as elements of sustainable diets is largely untapped. Forest foods represent an affordable source of food, especially for those with limited livelihood options, supplying micronutrients, fibres and other key food components most commonly lacking from diets. 2. Full realization of the contribution of forest and tree foods to sustainable diets faces a number of constraints. Key among these are knowledge gaps, issues related to tenure and access, aspects of sustainability of extraction, and rapidly evolving social and cultural contexts, which have a significant impact on diets. Research is needed on all these topics. 3. There is a need to promote better integration of information and knowledge on nutritious forest and tree foods into national nutrition strategies and programmes. The establishment of crosssectoral policy platforms that bring together nutrition, food security, environment, agriculture, health, development, conservation and land-use planning would help achieve this.

TI  - Food Security and Agriculture in Developing Countries: Measurement and hypotheses for impact evaluations
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper reviews the challenges related to establishing credible causal links between particular interventions and aggregate food security. A first set of challenges result from the lack of a common measurement of food security, with a multitude of indicators and definitions being used in different studies, making comparisons and broader inferences particularly hard. We discuss various measures and the existing evidence on their validity. We also line out a possible approach to validating some of the multi-dimensional measures in a more comprehensive way. A second set of challenges comes from the need to have credible exogenous variation in order to establish a causal relationship between an intervention and resulting food security outcomes. We review the literature and conclude that the literature to date leaves many open questions regarding the type of interventions that might be most effective to increase food security. This is due in part to the multitude of approaches to measurement of food security, and in part due to methodological concerns that limit causal inference in many of the existing studies. Likely, the optimal policy will also be strongly context-specific, and understanding the sensitivity of impacts to contextual changes hence is equally important.

TI  - Relationships between agrobiodiversity, dietary diversity and nutritional status in Tanzania
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: Agrobiodiversity is important for biodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture. Increasing agrobiodiversity may also improve dietary diversity and nutritional status in low income countries but research is lacking in this area. To fill this knowledge gap, this study explores relationships between agrobiodiversity, dietary diversity and nutritional status in Tanzania. The research investigates 1) the relationships between agrobiodiversity, dietary diversity and nutritional status in children in two villages in rural Tanzania and 2) the relationships between land cover, dietary diversity and nutrition in under five year olds in a nationally representative sample in Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 122 randomly selected households in Minyenye village, Singida district and Mbwei village, Lushoto district. Female heads of households were interviewed to collect quantitative and qualitative data on demographics, livelihoods, complementary feeding and household food sources. Dietary diversity was calculated from 24 hour dietary recalls which were collected for the respondent and their oldest child under five. Agrobiodiversity data were systematically collected using the point intercept method. All plants, both intentional crops and other plants, growing on the household’s farms at the time of data collection were measured and Shannon Biodiversity Indices were calculated. In addition to these indices, the food sources section of the questionnaire was used to calculate household crop and animal diversity scores. Heights and weights were measured in all family members and MUAC was collected for all children under 15 years old. Relationships between these factors were explored using regression analyses. At the national level relationships between land cover, from GlobCover 2009, and dietary diversity and nutrition, from the 2010 Tanzanian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), were investigated using spatial and regression analyses. Results: No significant associations were seen between dietary diversity and nutritional status in either village and dietary diversity was negatively associated with height for age z-scores in the DHS analyses. No significant associations were seen between agrobiodiversity and dietary diversity. Agricultural, but not forest, land cover was associated with dietary diversity. Associations between both agrobiodiversity and land cover and child nutritional status are complex. In Minyenye, agrobiodiversity was positively associated with children’s height for age while in Mbwei these were negatively associated with children’s body mass index (BMI) z-scores. More agricultural and forest land cover was associated with higher weight for height, however more agricultural land cover was associated with lower height for age. Positive associations were seen between eating and rearing animals and dietary diversity but negative or no associations were seen with nutritional status. Selling crops was positively associated with dietary diversity but showed mixed associations with nutritional status at the local village scale. Conclusion: Study results provide a word of caution for those attempting to increase agrobiodiversity to improve diet and nutritional status. The effectiveness of agricultural interventions aimed at improving nutrition through improvements in agrobiodiversity can only be evaluated in light of the multiple determinants of nutritional status. The current study’s results illustrate the complexity of the pathway from food production through consumption to nutrient utilization in low income countries.

TI  - Community-based agricultural interventions in the context of food and nutrition security in South Africa
PY  - 2011
AB  - Despite South Africa being a food-secure country in terms of aggregate food availability, it is listed by the World Health Organization as one of 36 high-burden countries, home to large numbers of stunted children. Recent findings, in the context of both over- and under-nutrition, have indicated that adult and child malnutrition rates have deteriorated in South Africa. The complementarities and synergies between food availability, access and utilisation need to be aligned in interventions used to address and strengthen food and nutrition security. This is particularly pertinent in the context of the widespread AIDS epidemic which interacts with food insecurity in complex ways. It is against this backdrop that home-grown or small-scale food production is explored as a feasible contributor to food and nutrition security for the rural poor with particular emphasis on contextual and technical factors. By illustrating a few successful models of home gardening, the evidence for addressing micronutrient deficiencies in these types of interventions is presented. The challenges to establish sustainable home gardening practices and the efforts needed to address gender-distinctive issues are discussed. The case is made for community-based agricultural interventions as a critical component of the various interventions used to address food and nutrition security at the household level.

TI  - TALKING FOOD: MOTIVATIONS OF HOME FOOD PRESERVATION PRACTITIONERS IN KENTUCKY
PY  - 2014
AB  - OF DISSERTATION TALKING FOOD: MOTIVATIONS OF HOME FOOD PRESERVATION PRACTITIONERS IN KENTUCKY Recent reports detail a rise in the practice of home food preservation in the United States due to economic woes, nutritional concerns, and increasing devotion to local food production. Home food preservation is the processing of foods in order to extend its shelf-life. Current common approaches to preserving foods at home include pressure canning, freezing, drying, water bath canning, and cellaring/storing. Local food production in four Kentucky counties were examined through in-depth qualitative interviews with home food preservation practitioners to yield a rural/urban comparison. Forty home food preservation practitioners were interviewed between Fall 2009 and Fall 2013. The primary question driving this project is what motivates those who grow gardens and practice home food preservation in an era of readily available, relatively cheap foodstuffs? Secondary questions include, how do the motivations of home food preservation practitioners compare in rural and urban areas? What are the links, if any, between home food preservation and environmental sustainability concerns in rural and urban areas? Each of these questions will be examined through a mixture of qualitative methods and a grounded theoretical approach. In-depth field interviews with 40 preservers, documentary filmmaking, and participant observation were conducted in two rural and two urban Kentucky counties. Interview transcripts were coded by themes, interpreted using hermeneutic analysis, and analyzed by grounded theory. Policy institutes could make gains from this research by building upon already existing community food practices. Agriculture extension agents could use these findings to inform their food preservation programs and improve safety recommendations.

TI  - Characteristics of smallholder farm households in Upper Egypt: Implications for nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions:
PY  - 2019
AB  - This paper characterizes smallholder farm households in Upper Egypt based on data from a comprehensive farm household survey. The results from the descriptive analysis in combination with findings from the global literature provide recommendations on how agricultural projects can be leveraged for improving nutrition. The importance of focusing on nutrition is underlined by relatively high undernutrition and overnutrition rates among the surveyed farm households: almost 18 percent of children under five years of age are stunted and almost 25 percent of them are at risk of being overweight. Agricultural interventions can impact nutrition through six main pathways, which are: 1) providing direct access to food from own production; 2) providing a source of income from which food and other nutrition needs can be met; 3) affecting food prices; 4) affecting womenâs social status and empowerment; 5) affecting womenâs time use from participation in agricultural work; and 6) affecting womenâs health and nutrition from engagement in agricultural activities. The surveyed farm households purchase in the market most of the foods that they consume, cultivating crops primarily for commercial sale. This finding suggests that access to food markets and the level of food prices are key determinants of food and nutrition security among smallholder farm households in Upper Egypt. The survey analysis also identified potential levers for increasing agricultural productivity, including promoting more efficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides and improving farming practices to narrow the productivity gap between small-scale farmers and medium and large-scale farmers. As the role of women in agricultural activities in Upper Egypt is limited, the gendered pathways for leveraging agriculture for improved nutrition are less relevant. However, to achieve positive impact on peopleâs diet or nutritional status that goes beyond income and price channels, programs that reach farm households in Upper Egypt should include education and behavioral change communication activities, including on themes related to breastfeeding, dietary diversity, physical activities, and sugar intake. For such activities to be effective, it is important to consider the low literacy levels in the population.

TI  - Poverty Alleviation through Integrated Pond Fish Farming with Poultry and Vegetables Production at Small Scale Farmers’ in Dilla Zuria Woreda, Southern Ethiopia
PY  - 2016
AB  - This study was conducted on the title " Poverty Alleviation through Integrated Pond Fish Farming with Poultry and Vegetable Production on Small Scale Farmers’ in Dilla Zuria Woreda, Southern Ethiopia" aiming to demonstrate and assess the possibility of reducing poverty at small scale farmers’ level through integrated pond fish farming with poultry and vegetable production, to see the profitability of integrated pond fish farming with poultry and vegetable production in comparing to mono farming at small scale farmers’ level and to identify factors that affect farmers' to implement integrated Pond fish farming with Poultry and Vegetable production at the study area. The primary data were collected by using PRA tools and secondary data from related literatures. The data were analyzed by using both qualitative (tabulation, narration) and quantitative techniques (percentage, frequency and cost-benefit analysis using Net present value (NPV). The results of this study revealed that, integrated pond fish farming with poultry and vegetable production can play a significant role in increasing manifold production, income and nutrition over mono farming for poverty alleviation at small scale producers. In principal a project is accepted if the NPV is non-negative. Accordingly, the NPV of the project at 8.5% of discount rate was found to be Birr 622 per 0.0224ha of land is acceptable. The major factors that affect farmers to implement this integration at the study area were: lack of training and researches on improving farmers’ indigenous knowledge on integration, and lack of improved vegetables seeds and fingerling dissemination center to the farmers in the areas. Based on the results, the following recommendation forwarded: it is imperative that policy makers and local extension planner, agricultural extension implementers and NGOs pay utmost attention to this integrated farming to reduce poverty at small scale farmers and pay attention to the constraints that affect farmers’ to implement this integration. The issues that need immediate attention include, among others, delivery of training to farmers’ on improving skill and knowledge on this integration, and developing fingerling dissemination center to the farmers' in the study area.

We assessed baseline-endline and between-treatment arm differences using a 10-food group diet diversity score (DDS), the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) indicator, and 7-day frequency of ASF consumption.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Among 118 participants (39 in both treatment arm 1 and treatment arm 3, and 40 in treatment arm 2, with no participant refusals), DDS increased from a mean (SD) of 4.0 (1.3) at baseline to 5.1 (0.9) at endline (<i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of women achieving the MDD-W indicator nearly doubled from baseline (35.6%) to endline (69.5%) (<i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.0001). Frequency of ASF consumption similarly increased for meat and poultry (2.7 (4.1) to 4.7 (5.3); <i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.0001) and eggs (1.5 (3.1) to 2.3 (4.9); <i>P</i>-value = 0.02). Few differences in these outcomes were observed among treatment arms.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A BCC intervention improved diet diversity and consumption of ASFs among participants. However, neither a group-based microcredit nor improved smoke oven intervention, both of which increased women's income, led to additional dietary improvements.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2022 Elizabeth F.
