TI  - Impact of Climate Change and Variability on Irrigation Requirements: A Global Perspective
PY  - 2002
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change does not only affect water resources but also water demand. Future water and food security will depend, among other factors, on the impact of climate change on water demand for irrigation. Using a recently developed global irrigation model, with a spatial resolution of 0.5° by 0.5°, we present the first global analysis of the impact of climate change and climate variability on irrigation water requirements. We compute how long-term average irrigation requirements might change under the climatic conditions of the 2020s and the 2070s, as provided by two climate models, and relate these changes to the variations in irrigation requirements caused by long-term and interannual climate variability in the 20th century. Two-thirds of the global area equipped for irrigation in 1995 will possibly suffer from increased water requirements, and on up to half of the total area (depending on the measure of variability), the negative impact of climate change is more significant than that of climate variability.

TI  - Global Water and Food Security: Megatrends and Emerging Issues
PY  - 2009
AB  - Feeding the world’s growing population will depend to a large extent on irrigation, but the future of irrigation water supplies is increasingly constrained by growth in other sectors. Other challenges, including declining water quality, falling groundwater tables, and growing environmental demands for water further constrain water availability for irrigation. Moreover, globalization and trade liberalization will increasingly impact water use and food production. Some of these challenges will be mediated by what we label the new ABCs of the future of water and food security: Aquaculture, Biotechnology, and Climate Change. In order to address these old and new challenges, fundamental changes in water management are necessary. With the right reforms in water management, implementation of appropriate economic incentives and investments in water infrastructure and agricultural research, progress can be made toward solving these challenges.

TI  - The global value of water in agriculture.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Major environmental functions and human needs critically depend on water. In regions of the world affected by water scarcity economic activities can be constrained by water availability, leading to competition both among sectors and between human uses and environmental needs. While the commodification of water remains a contentious political issue, the valuation of this natural resource is sometime viewed as a strategy to avoid water waste. Likewise, water markets have been invoked as a mechanism to allocate water to economically most efficient uses. The value of water, however, remains difficult to estimate because water markets and market prices exist only in few regions of the world. Despite numerous attempts at estimating the value of water in the absence of markets (i.e., the "shadow price"), a global spatially explicit assessment of the value of water in agriculture is still missing. Here we propose a data-parsimonious biophysical framework to determine the value generated by water in irrigated agriculture and highlight its global spatiotemporal patterns. We find that in much of the world the actual crop distribution does not maximize agricultural water value.

TI  - Uniformity testing of variable-rate center pivot irrigation control systems
PY  - 2006
AB  - As water supplies become limited, agricultural water use needs to become more efficient to maintain current productivity levels. The efficiency of center pivot and linear move irrigation systems can be increased by matching the amount and rate of water application to specific soil conditions that vary in the field. Such site-specific application can be achieved by variable-rate control systems. Although such systems are being developed, their effects on center pivot and linear move uniformity have not been documented. The uniformity along the length of a center pivot and a linear move irrigation system was measured at two system movement speeds and three variable-rate settings. One variable-rate system is commercially available using pneumatically actuated solenoid valves to turn groups of sprinklers ON and OFF at fractions of a minute corresponding to the cycle rate, for example a 50% cycle rate is 30 s ON and 30 s OFF. The other variable-rate system used commonly available electric solenoid valves to accomplish the same task. Overall, the coefficient of uniformity and low quarter distribution uniformity averaged 93% and 0.90, respectively for the center pivot irrigation system; 84% and 0.74 for the linear move system. The results were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by wind speed, cycling rate, or system movement speed. The type of nozzle did influence the uniformity because of the distinctly different application characteristics of rotator, fixed plate, and wobbling low pressure sprinklers. Thus, the variable-rate technologies tested under the conditions presented in this paper had at least as good uniformity as the center pivot and linear move systems when functioning in non-variable-rate mode.

TI  - Water and economic development : The role of variability and a framework for resilience
PY  - 2006
AB  - The article advances the hypothesis that the seasonal and inter-annual variability of rainfall is a significant and measurable factor in the economic development of nations. An analysis of global datasets reveals a statistically significant relationship between greater rainfall variability and lower per capita GDP. Having established this correlation, we construct a water resources development index that highlights areas that have the greatest need for storage infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of rainfall variability on water availability for food and basic livelihood. The countries with the most critical infrastructure needs according to this metric are among the poorest in the world, and the majority of them are located in Africa. The importance of securing water availability in these nations increases every day in light of current population growth, economic development, and climate change projections.

TI  - Acting on an environmental health disaster: the case of the Aral Sea.
PY  - 2001
AB  - The Aral Sea area in Central Asia has been encountering one of the world's greatest environmental disasters for more than 15 years. During that time, despite many assessments and millions of dollars spent by large, multinational organizations, little has changed. The 5 million people living in this neglected and virtually unknown part of the world are suffering not only from an environmental catastrophe that has no easy solutions but also from a litany of health problems. The region is often dismissed as a chronic problem where nothing positive can be achieved. Within this complicated context, Medecins Sans Frontieres, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, is actively trying to assess the impact of the environmental disaster on human health to help the people who live in the Aral Sea area cope with their environment. Medecins Sans Frontieres has combined a direct medical program to improve the health of the population while conducting operational research to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the environmental disaster and human health outcomes. In this paper we explore the health situation of the region and the broader policy context in which it is situated, and present some ideas that could potentially be applied to many other places in the world that are caught up in environmental and human health disasters.

TI  - Tipping from the Holocene to the Anthropocene: How threatened are major world deltas?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Coastal deltas are landforms that typically offer a wide variety of benefits to society including highly fertile soils for agricultural development, freshwater resources, and rich biodiversity. For these reasons, many deltas are densely populated, are important economic hubs, and have been transformed by human interventions such as agricultural intensification, modification of water and sediment fluxes, as well as urbanization and industrialization. Additionally, deltas are increasingly affected by the consequences of climate change including sea level rise, and by other natural hazards such as cyclones and storm surges. Five examples of major deltas (Rhine-Meuse, Ganges, Indus, Mekong, and Danube) illustrate the force of human interventions in shaping and transforming deltas and in inducing shifts between four different social-ecological system (SES) states: Holocene, modified Holocene, Anthropocene and ‘collapsed’. The three Asian deltas are rapidly changing but whereas SES in the Ganges and Indus deltas are in danger of tipping into a ‘collapsed’ state, SES in the Mekong delta, which is at the crossroads of various development pathways, could increase in resilience in the future. The Rhine-Meuse and Danube delta examples show that highly managed states may allow, under specific conditions, for interventions leading to increasingly resilient systems. However, little is known about the long-term effects of rapid human interventions in deltas. It is therefore critical to increase the knowledge-base related to SES dynamics and to better characterize social tipping points or turning points in order to avoid unacceptable changes.

TI  - Global Hydrological Cycles and World Water Resources
PY  - 2006
AB  - Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.

TI  - Breeding for high water-use efficiency.
PY  - 2004
AB  - There is a pressing need to improve the water-use efficiency of rain-fed and irrigated crop production. Breeding crop varieties with higher water-use efficiency is seen as providing part of the solution. Three key processes can be exploited in breeding for high water-use efficiency: (i) moving more of the available water through the crop rather than it being wasted as evaporation from the soil surface or drainage beyond the root zone or being left behind in the root zone at harvest; (ii) acquiring more carbon (biomass) in exchange for the water transpired by the crop, i.e. improving crop transpiration efficiency; (iii) partitioning more of the achieved biomass into the harvested product. The relative importance of any one of these processes will vary depending on how water availability varies during the crop cycle. However, these three processes are not independent. Targeting specific traits to improve one process may have detrimental effects on the other two, but there may also be positive interactions. Progress in breeding for improved water-use efficiency of rain-fed wheat is reviewed to illustrate the nature of some of these interactions and to highlight opportunities that may be exploited in other crops as well as potential pitfalls. For C3 species, measuring carbon isotope discrimination provides a powerful means of improving water-use efficiency of leaf gas exchange, but experience has shown that improvements in leaf-level water-use efficiency may not always translate into higher crop water-use efficiency or yield. In fact, the reverse has frequently been observed. Reasons for this are explored in some detail. Crop simulation modelling can be used to assess the likely impact on water-use efficiency and yield of changing the expression of traits of interest. Results of such simulations indicate that greater progress may be achieved by pyramiding traits so that potential negative effects of individual traits are neutralized. DNA-based selection techniques may assist in such a strategy.

TI  - Irrigation and poverty alleviation: review of the empirical evidence
PY  - 2004
AB  - L'objectif de cette etude est de clarifier les relations entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete en offrant une revue objective de la recherche recente sur le sujet. Les questions cles abordees ici sont: (1) quel est le role du developpement et de la gestion de l'irrigation sur la reduction de la pauvrete? (2) quels sont les articulations et chemins par lesquels l'irrigation contribue a reduire la pauvrete? (3) quelle est l'ampleur des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? et (4) quels sont les facteurs cles des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? Notre revue se focalise sur des etudes empiriques d'actualite en Asie. La revue approfondie entreprise suggere qu'il y a de fortes connections entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete. Ces connections sont a la fois directes et indirectes. Les connections directes agissent a travers des effets localises et a l'echelle des foyers, tandis que les connections indirectes operent a travers des impacts collectifs ou a l'echelle sub-nationale et nationale. L'irrigation beneficie aux pauvres par le biais d'une production accrue, de rendements plus eleves, d'un plus faible risque d'echec cultural et d'une meilleure situation de l'emploi tout au long de l'annee, dans les exploitations comme en dehors. L'irrigation permet aux petits producteurs d'adopter des cultures plus diversifiees et de passer d'une production de subsistance, de faible valeur, a une production de forte valeur, orientee vers le marche. L'augmentation de la production donne acces aux pauvres a une nourriture abordable. Les connections indirectes operent a travers des effets a l'echelle regionale, nationale et de l'economie. Les investissements en irrigation agissent comme des modificateurs de production et d'approvisionnement, et ont d'importants effets positifs sur la croissance, beneficiant aux pauvres sur le long terme. Au-dela de ceci, les benefices de l'irrigation reviennent aussi aux pauvres et sans-terres sur le long terme, malgre le fait que, sur un plus court terme, les benefices vers ceux qui n'ont pas ou peu de terres peuvent etre faibles du fait que l'allocation de l'eau tend a etre basee sur les terres. En depit de cela, les pauvres et sans-terres beneficient, a la fois en termes absolus et relatifs, des investissements en irrigation. De recentes avancees dans les technologies d'irrigation, par exemple les systemes de micro-irrigation, ont un fort potentiel anti-pauvrete. Des etudes en cours dans des pays asiatiques supportent fortement le fait que l'irrigation aide a reduire a la fois la pauvrete permanente et temporaire. Au-dela de ceci, l'irrigation aide a alleger la pauvrete dans ses pires formes, nommement la pauvrete chronique. En general, l'irrigation augmente la productivite, favorise la croissance et reduit la pauvrete. Des exemples d'effets d'externalites negatives associes a des systemes irrigues de grande et moyenne echelle pointent vers des problemes de gestion, appelant par consequent a des mecanismes de reponse plus englobants de la part des communautes politiques et de gestion. Les impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation peuvent etre intensifies en creant les conditions ou les environnements qui permettraient de realiser une inclusion fonctionnelle des pauvres. Ces conditions et environnements comprennent: (1) un acces equitable a la terre; (2) une gestion integree des ressources en eau; (3) un acces a de l'eau de surface et souterraine de bonne qualite et en quantite adequate; (4) une technologie moderne de production; (5) un passage a une production a forte valeur ajoutee, orientee vers le marche; et (6) des opportunites pour la vente des produits agricoles a faibles couts transactionnels. Les benefices de l'irrigation aux pauvres peuvent etre intensifies en initiant

TI  - Climate change will affect the Asian water towers.
PY  - 2010
AB  - More than 1.4 billion people depend on water from the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. Upstream snow and ice reserves of these basins, important in sustaining seasonal water availability, are likely to be affected substantially by climate change, but to what extent is yet unclear. Here, we show that meltwater is extremely important in the Indus basin and important for the Brahmaputra basin, but plays only a modest role for the Ganges, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security. The Brahmaputra and Indus basins are most susceptible to reductions of flow, threatening the food security of an estimated 60 million people.

AB  - This paper argues that a water market is physically feasible in the existing reality of Pakistan’s Indus Basin Irrigation System at the watercourse and distributary levels. The paper starts by describing the existing system and contrasts it with ideal economic management of surface water. It then lays out the degree and extent of modification to outlet structures that would be needed to enable trading based on structure type and the scale of the water-trading region, along with a first glance at the relative costs of those modifications. The ongoing decentralization of irrigation management should support water-trading efforts.

TI  - Coping better with current climatic variability in the rain-fed farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa: An essential first step in adapting to future climate change?
PY  - 2008
AB  - Rain-fed agriculture will remain the dominant source of staple food production and the livelihood foundation of the majority of the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Greatly enhanced investment in agriculture by a broad range of stakeholders will be required if this sector is to meet the food security requirements of tomorrow's Africa. However, production uncertainty associated with between and within season rainfall variability remains a fundamental constraint to many investors who often over estimate the negative impacts of climate induced uncertainty. Climate change is likely to make matters worse with increases in rainfall variability being predicted. The ability of agricultural communities and agricultural stakeholders in SSA to cope better with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability must first be enhanced for them to be able to adapt to climate change and the predicted future increase in climate variability. Tools and approaches are now available that allow for a better understanding, characterization and mapping of the agricultural implications of climate variability and the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to stakeholders needs. Application of these tools allows the development and dissemination of targeted investment innovations that have a high probability of biophysical and economic success in the context of climate variability.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on malaria in Africa: paddies paradox
PY  - 2001
AB  - The high population growth rate of the African continent has led to an increased demand for food and is in danger of outstripping agricultural production. In order to meet this need, many governments have sought ways of improving food production by initiating large-scale irrigation projects, involving reclamation of arid and semi-arid areas for the cultivation of crops. Although crop irrigation promises one solution to alleviating hunger and encourages economic growth, irrigation has often been blamed for aggravating disease in local communities. Malaria is one of the major tropical diseases associated with irrigation schemes, and changes in the transmission pattern of this disease following irrigation development have been a perennial subject of debate. It has often been assumed that high numbers of malaria vector Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) resulting from irrigation schemes lead inevitably to increased malaria in local communities. However, recent studies in Africa have revealed a more complex picture. Increased numbers of vectors following irrigation can lead to increased malaria in areas of unstable transmission, where people have little or no immunity to malaria parasites, such as the African highlands and desert fringes. But for most of sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is stable, the introduction of crop irrigation has little impact on malaria transmission. Indeed, there is growing evidence that for many sites there is less malaria in irrigated communities than surrounding areas. The explanation for this finding is still unresolved but, in some cases at least, can be attributed to displacement of the most endophilic and anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles funestus Giles by An. arabiensis Patton with lower vectorial capacity, as the latter thrives more than the former in ricefields. Similarly, among members of the An. gambiae complex, some cytotypes of An. gambiae sensu stricto are more vectorial than others. For example, the Mopti form has high vectorial capacity and breeds perennially in irrigated sites, whereas the savanna form is often sympatric but more seasonal. Also we suggest that many communities near irrigation schemes benefit from the greater wealth created by these schemes. Consequently irrigation communities often have greater use of bednets, better access to improved healthcare and receive fewer infective bites compared with those outside such development schemes. Thus, in most cases, irrigation schemes in Africa do not appear to increase malaria risk, except in areas of unstable transmission. However, developers should take the opportunity to improve health-care facilities for local communities when planning irrigation schemes wherever they occur.

TI  - Groundwater use for irrigation - a global inventory
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract. Irrigation is the most important water use sector accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawals and 90% of consumptive water uses. While the extent of irrigation and related water uses are reported in statistical databases or estimated by model simulations, information on the source of irrigation water is scarce and very scattered. Here we present a new global inventory on the extent of areas irrigated with groundwater, surface water or non-conventional sources, and we determine the related consumptive water uses. The inventory provides data for 15 038 national and sub-national administrative units. Irrigated area was provided by census-based statistics from international and national organizations. A global model was then applied to simulate consumptive water uses for irrigation by water source. Globally, area equipped for irrigation is currently about 301 million ha of which 38% are equipped for irrigation with groundwater. Total consumptive groundwater use for irrigation is estimated as 545 km3 yr−1, or 43% of the total consumptive irrigation water use of 1277 km3 yr−1. The countries with the largest extent of areas equipped for irrigation with groundwater, in absolute terms, are India (39 million ha), China (19 million ha) and the USA (17 million ha). Groundwater use in irrigation is increasing both in absolute terms and in percentage of total irrigation, leading in places to concentrations of users exploiting groundwater storage at rates above groundwater recharge. Despite the uncertainties associated with statistical data available to track patterns and growth of groundwater use for irrigation, the inventory presented here is a major step towards a more informed assessment of agricultural water use and its consequences for the global water cycle.

TI  - International trade buffers the impact of future irrigation shortfalls
PY  - 2014
AB  - There is increasing interest in the water–food nexus, especially the restrictive effect of water on food production in hot spots where irrigation stress is growing. However, little is known about the larger-scale implications of future irrigation shortfalls for global trade and economic welfare, as well as of the potential buffering impacts of international trade on the local impacts of irrigation shortage. In this paper, we utilize a recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, to study the economic effects of changes in irrigation outlook for 126 river basins, globally by 2030. Projected irrigation availability is obtained from the IMPACT-WATER model, and imposed upon the present-day economy. Irrigation availability in 2030 is expected to drop by 30–60% in several key rivers basins, including: Hai He, Indus, Luni, and the Eastern Mediterranean basin, leading to significant output declines in China, South Asia, and the Middle East. We find that the regional production impacts of future irrigation water shortages are quite heterogeneous, depending on the size of the shortfall, the irrigation intensity of crop production, the possibility of expanding rainfed areas, as well as the crop mix. These changes in regional output significantly alter the geography of international trade. To compensate for the loss of productivity caused by the irrigation constraint, an estimated 7.6 million hectares of cropland expansion is needed to meet the demand for food. In spite of the remarkable reduction of irrigation in some basins, the resulting welfare impact is relatively modest as a result of the buffering capacity of global markets. The global welfare loss amounts to $3.7 billion (2001 prices) and results from a combination of the reduction in irrigation availability as well as the interplay with agricultural support policies.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON IRRIGATION
PY  - 1993
AB  - The paper presents a procedure for estimating the influence of surface air temperature change on plant potential evapotranspiration and water supplies assuming rainfall and other climate parameters remain unchanged. On the basis of this procedure, it is estimated that 1 °C increase in temperature will produce an average annual increase in potential evapotranspiration in the western U.S. of about 40 mm. It also is estimated that the average annual runoff will decrease by about 6–8 percent for the same temperature increase, assuming no change in precipitation.If global temperatures increase, the spatial and temporal variabilities of climate are also expected to increase. Globally, rainfall is projected to increase, but the locations and extent of desert areas are expected to change. Weather is expected to become more extreme and variable. Water requirements in arid areas are projected to increase. Planning is needed to mitigate through improved management strategies the likely adverse effects of climatic ch...

TI  - Habitat fragmentation and species extirpation in freshwater ecosystems; causes of range decline of the Indus river dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor).
PY  - 2014
AB  - Habitat fragmentation of freshwater ecosystems is increasing rapidly, however the understanding of extinction debt and species decline in riverine habitat fragments lags behind that in other ecosystems. The mighty rivers that drain the Himalaya - the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Mekong and Yangtze - are amongst the world’s most biodiverse freshwater ecosystems. Many hundreds of dams have been constructed, are under construction, or are planned on these rivers and large hydrological changes and losses of biodiversity have occurred and are expected to continue. This study examines the causes of range decline of the Indus dolphin, which inhabits one of the world’s most modified rivers, to demonstrate how we may expect other vertebrate populations to respond as planned dams and water developments come into operation. The historical range of the Indus dolphin has been fragmented into 17 river sections by diversion dams; dolphin sighting and interview surveys show that river dolphins have been extirpated from ten river sections, they persist in 6, and are of unknown status in one section. Seven potential factors influencing the temporal and spatial pattern of decline were considered in three regression model sets. Low dry-season river discharge, due to water abstraction at irrigation barrages, was the principal factor that explained the dolphin’s range decline, influencing 1) the spatial pattern of persistence, 2) the temporal pattern of subpopulation extirpation, and 3) the speed of extirpation after habitat fragmentation. Dolphins were more likely to persist in the core of the former range because water diversions are concentrated near the range periphery. Habitat fragmentation and degradation of the habitat were inextricably intertwined and in combination caused the catastrophic decline of the Indus dolphin.

TI  - Influence of extreme weather disasters on global crop production
PY  - 2016
AB  - In recent years, several extreme weather disasters have partially or completely damaged regional crop production. While detailed regional accounts of the effects of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified. Here we estimate for the first time, to our knowledge, national cereal production losses across the globe resulting from reported extreme weather disasters during 1964-2007. We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national cereal production by 9-10%, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight ~7% greater production damage from more recent droughts and 8-11% more damage in developed countries than in developing ones. Our findings may help to guide agricultural priorities in international disaster risk reduction and adaptation efforts.

TI  - Water for Agriculture: Maintaining Food Security under Growing Scarcity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the main source of water withdrawals, accounting for around 70% of all the world’s freshwater withdrawals. The development of irrigated agriculture has boosted agricultural yields and contributed to price stability, making it possible to feed the world’s growing population. Rapidly increasing nonagricultural demands for water, changing food preferences, global climate change, and new demands for biofuel production place increasing pressure on scarce water resources. Challenges of growing water scarcity for agriculture are heightened by the increasing costs of developing new water, soil degradation, groundwater depletion, increasing water pollution, the degradation of water-related ecosystems, and wasteful use of already developed water supplies. This article discusses the role of water for agriculture and food security, the challenges facing irrigated agriculture, and the range of policies, institutions, and investments needed to secure adequate access to water for food today and in the future.

TI  - Fertilizing nature: a tragedy of excess in the commons.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Globally, we are applying excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizers to our agricultural crops, which ultimately causes nitrogen pollution to our ecosphere. The atmosphere is polluted by N2O and NOx gases that directly and indirectly increase atmospheric warming and climate change. Nitrogen is also leached from agricultural lands as the water-soluble form NO3−, which increases nutrient overload in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing “dead zones”, reducing property values and the diversity of aquatic life, and damaging our drinking water and aquatic-associated industries such as fishing and tourism. Why do some countries show reductions in fertilizer use while others show increasing use? What N fertilizer application reductions could occur, without compromising crop yields? And what are the economic and environmental benefits of using directed nutrient management strategies?

TI  - Irrigation projects in Ethiopia: what can be done to enhance effectiveness under ‘challenging contexts’?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Investment in small scale irrigation (SSI) is crucial to sustain food security and livelihoods of smallholders. In Ethiopia, the government and development partners show a growing interest in developing irrigation projects. The success of irrigation projects is determined by governance and socio-cultural contexts. Yet the lack of thorough understanding of the challenging contexts undermines the efforts to achieve sustainability outcomes in irrigation projects. This article identifies the challenging contexts to irrigation projects, examines how the challenging contexts influence the effectiveness of irrigation projects, and indicates ways of improving the effectiveness of irrigation projects under the existing challenging contexts. Data were collected between April and December 2011 in three regional states of Ethiopia using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The lack of governance capacity and accountability are critical challenges for the sustainability of the irrigation projects. In addit...

TI  - Property rights and sustainable irrigation: A developing country perspective
PY  - 2014
AB  - While the role of secure property rights contributing to sustainable natural resource management is increasingly recognized, translating that into practice is more challenging, especially in developing countries. This article presents a framework for understanding the role of property rights for effective irrigation systems and then explores the complexity of property rights to land, water, and infrastructure and their underlying institutions. Understanding property rights in practice requires acknowledging legal pluralism—the coexistence of many types and sources of law, which can be used as the basis for claiming rights over the resources. Property rights do not necessarily imply full ownership, but are composed of different bundles of rights that may be held by different claimants—the state, user groups, families, or individuals. These rights are critical for the authority, incentives, and resources for irrigation operation and maintenance. As resources become more scarce, property rights systems need to adapt to reduce conflict and provide incentives for saving water. However, efforts to improve irrigation by changing property rights systems have often failed because they have not recognized the difficulty of transplanting property rights systems from one place to another. Institutional change needs to be seen as an organic process, building on existing norms and practices, rather than as an exercise in social engineering.

TI  - Water availability and land subsidence in the Central Valley, California, USA
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Central Valley in California (USA) covers about 52,000 km2 and is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. This agriculture relies heavily on surface-water diversions and groundwater pumpage to meet irrigation water demand. Because the valley is semi-arid and surface-water availability varies substantially, agriculture relies heavily on local groundwater. In the southern two thirds of the valley, the San Joaquin Valley, historic and recent groundwater pumpage has caused significant and extensive drawdowns, aquifer-system compaction and subsidence. During recent drought periods (2007–2009 and 2012-present), groundwater pumping has increased owing to a combination of decreased surface-water availability and land-use changes. Declining groundwater levels, approaching or surpassing historical low levels, have caused accelerated and renewed compaction and subsidence that likely is mostly permanent. The subsidence has caused operational, maintenance, and construction-design problems for water-delivery and flood-control canals in the San Joaquin Valley. Planning for the effects of continued subsidence in the area is important for water agencies. As land use, managed aquifer recharge, and surface-water availability continue to vary, long-term groundwater-level and subsidence monitoring and modelling are critical to understanding the dynamics of historical and continued groundwater use resulting in additional water-level and groundwater storage declines, and associated subsidence. Modeling tools such as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model, can be used in the evaluation of management strategies to mitigate adverse impacts due to subsidence while also optimizing water availability. This knowledge will be critical for successful implementation of recent legislation aimed toward sustainable groundwater use.

TI  - When to turn the water off: scheduling micro-irrigation with a wetting front detector
PY  - 2003
AB  - The science of irrigation scheduling is well advanced, but the field application of this knowledge among irrigators is limited. Case studies are presented to show why irrigators may fail to adopt or persevere with traditional irrigation scheduling methods. This paper describes a funnel-shaped wetting front detector that is buried at an appropriate depth in the root zone. As a wetting front moves into the funnel of the detector, the water content increases due to convergence, so that the water content at the base of the funnel reaches saturation. The free water produced is detected electronically and this provides the signal to stop irrigation. Since the philosophy of drip irrigation in most cases is to supply water little and often, the "when to turn the water on" question becomes redundant and knowing when to turn the water off is more useful. Two further case studies demonstrate the benefits of scheduling micro-irrigation using wetting front detectors. The detectors retain a water sample from each irrigation event and this was used to monitor nitrate movement in and below the root zone.

TI  - The Shadow Price of Irrigation Water in Major Groundwater-Depleting Countries
PY  - 2019
AB  - In many semiarid regions with irrigation, the depletion rate of groundwater resources has increased substantially during the last decades. A possible reason for this is that the price that users pay for their water does not reflect its scarcity and value. An alternative way to assess the perceived value of water is calculating its shadow price, which is defined here as the marginal value produced, and relates to the efficiency gain from current reallocation. Here we determine the shadow price of water used for irrigation for the most important groundwater‐depleting countries and for four staple crops and one cash crop. To quantify the shadow price, the relation between the output and the water input is represented using production functions. We use globally available panel data on country‐specific crop yields and prices together with crop‐specific water consumption, calculated with the global hydrological model PCR‐GLOBWB, to parameterize the production function by country and crop with econometric analyses. Our results show that the variation of shadow prices for staple crops within several countries is high, indicating economically inefficient use of water resources, including nonrenewable groundwater. We also analyze the effects of reallocating irrigation water between crops, showing that changes in water allocation could lead to either an increase in the economic efficiency of water use or large reductions in irrigation water consumption. Our study thus provides a hydroeconomic basis to stimulate sustainable use of finite groundwater resources globally.

TI  - How would the Rogun Dam affect water and energy scarcity in Central Asia
PY  - 2015
AB  - The construction of the Rogun Dam in the Amu Darya Basin to increase upstream energy generation creates potential trade-offs with existing downstream irrigation, due to the different timing of energy and irrigation water demands. The present analysis, based on a hydro-economic optimization model, shows that cooperative basin-wide maximization of benefits would lead to large increases in upstream hydropower production and only minor changes in downstream irrigation benefits. However, if upstream stations, including Rogun, are managed unilaterally to maximize energy production, hydropower benefits might more than double while irrigation benefits greatly decrease, thereby substantially reducing overall basin benefits.

TI  - What happens after technology adoption? Gendered aspects of small-scale irrigation technologies in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Tanzania
PY  - 2018
AB  - Diverse agricultural technologies are promoted to increase yields and incomes, save time, improve food and nutritional security, and even empower women. Yet a gender gap in technology adoption remains for many agricultural technologies, even for those that are promoted for women. This paper complements the literature on gender and technology adoption, which largely focuses on reasons for low rates of female technology adoption, by shifting attention to what happens within a household after it adopts a technology. Understanding the expected benefits and costs of adoption, from the perspective of women users in households with adult males, can help explain observed technology adoption rates and why technology adoption is often not sustained in the longer term. Drawing on qualitative data from Ethiopia, Ghana, and Tanzania, this paper develops a framework for examining the intrahousehold distribution of benefits from technology adoption, focusing on small-scale irrigation technologies. The framework contributes to the conceptual and empirical exploration of joint control over technology by men and women in the same household. Efforts to promote technology adoption for agricultural development and women’s empowerment would benefit from an understanding of intrahousehold control over technology to avoid interpreting technology adoption as an end in and of itself.

TI  - Evaluating the pathways from small-scale irrigation to dietary diversity: evidence from Ethiopia and Tanzania
PY  - 2018
AB  - Interventions that aim to increase water availability for agriculture hold great potential for improving nutrition through increasing food production, generating income, enhancing water access and sanitation and hygiene conditions, and through strengthening women’s empowerment. Yet there is scarce evidence on the linkages between small-scale irrigation and the pathways through which nutrition outcomes can be achieved. Using data from a cross-sectional household survey collected in Ethiopia and Tanzania, we explored the potential for small-scale irrigation to contribute to improved diets, and identify the pathways through which irrigation affects dietary diversity as measured by the Household Dietary Diversity Score. Unadjusted comparisons show that irrigating households in both countries produced more vegetables, fruits and cash crops, are less food insecure, have a higher value of production, and have higher production diversity and dietary diversity compared to non-irrigating households. Econometric results of a simultaneous equation (3SLS) model showed that irrigation leads to better household dietary diversity mainly through the pathway of increasing household incomes. However, these results are statistically significant only in the case of Ethiopia, and not in Tanzania. While irrigation increased production diversity in Ethiopia, the benefits of increased dietary diversity cannot be attributed to these changes in production after controlling for the effect of income. Other factors, such as gender of the household head and having off-farm income, also influence dietary diversity in Ethiopia. These findings suggest that the potential for irrigation to influence diets is highly context-specific. Understanding the particular pathways and entry points for nutrition-sensitive agriculture approaches could help to improve their benefits for nutrition.

TI  - Malaria and large dams in sub-Saharan Africa: future impacts in a changing climate.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has embarked on a new era of dam building to improve food security and promote economic development. Nonetheless, the future impacts of dams on malaria transmission are poorly understood and seldom investigated in the context of climate and demographic change. The distribution of malaria in the vicinity of 1268 existing dams in SSA was mapped under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. Population projections and malaria incidence estimates were used to compute population at risk of malaria in both RCPs. Assuming no change in socio-economic interventions that may mitigate impacts, the change in malaria stability and malaria burden in the vicinity of the dams was calculated for the two RCPs through to the 2080s. Results were compared against the 2010 baseline. The annual number of malaria cases associated with dams and climate change was determined for each of the RCPs. The number of dams located in malarious areas is projected to increase in both RCPs. Population growth will add to the risk of transmission. The population at risk of malaria around existing dams and associated reservoirs, is estimated to increase from 15 million in 2010 to 21–23 million in the 2020s, 25–26 million in the 2050s and 28–29 million in the 2080s, depending on RCP. The number of malaria cases associated with dams in malarious areas is expected to increase from 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.2–1.6 million in the 2020s, 2.1–3.0 million in the 2050s and 2.4–3.0 million in the 2080s depending on RCP. The number of cases will always be higher in RCP 8.5 than RCP 2.6. In the absence of changes in other factors that affect transmission (e.g., socio-economic), the impact of dams on malaria in SSA will be significantly exacerbated by climate change and increases in population. Areas without malaria transmission at present, which will transition to regions of unstable transmission, may be worst affected. Modifying conventional water management frameworks to improve malaria control, holds the potential to mitigate some of this increase and should be more actively implemented.

TI  - Impacts of considering climate variability on investment decisions in Ethiopia
PY  - 2008
AB  - Extreme interannual variability of precipitation within Ethiopia is not uncommon, inducing droughts or floods and often creating serious repercussions on agricultural and nonagricultural commodities. A dynamic climate module is integrated into an economy-wide model containing a detailed zonal level agricultural structure. This coupled climate-economic model is used to evaluate the effects of climate variability on prospective irrigation and infrastructure investment strategies, and the ensuing country-wide economy. The linkages between the dynamic climate module and the economic model are created by the introduction of a climate-yield factor (CYF), defined at the crop level and varied across Ethiopian zones. Nine sets of variable climate (VC) data are processed by the coupled model, generating stochastic wet and dry shocks, producing an ensemble of potential economic prediction indicators. Analysis of gross domestic product and poverty rate reveal a significant overestimation of the country’s future welfare under all investment strategies when climate variability is ignored. The coupled model ensemble is further utilized for risk assessment to guide Ethiopian policy and planning.

TI  - The World Bank and Irrigation - The World Bank and irrigation
PY  - 1995
AB  - This document follows a review written by the Operations Evaluation Department staff and consultants. It examines more than four decades of World Bank irrigation experience, especially the Bank's irrigation lending, which has accounted for seven percent of all lending. The study focuses on 208 Bank-funded irrigation projects that have been evaluated and it chiefly addresses two questions: 1) what has the Bank's irrigation policy been? and 2) what have been the returns on irrigation investments? Sixty-nine percent of all lending has gone to humid tropical Asia, where irrigation systems are used chiefly to grow rice; while the other 31 percent of Bank lending for irrigation has been split between Africa, the Americas, and Europe. Evaluations have rated 67 percent of irrigation projects satisfactory overall. At appraisal, the economic rate of return on irrigation investments was expected to average 22 percent. The average unweighted evaluation rate of return was 15 percent. When projects are weighted by size of area served, the appraisal expected rate of return was 29 percent; the evaluation rate of return, 25 percent. Therefore, the overall impact of Bank-financed irrigation projects has been relatively good. The factors that most significantly affect the outcome of irrigation projects are the size of the irrigated area, output price, crop yield, and unit cost. In the Bank's irrigation sector work, for the sample analyzed, little attention has been paid to environmental planning, specifically to wather allocation and natural resource planning, but the situation is improving. Sector report coverage of specific areas of environmental impact has been poor and is still quithe weak. The study finds that irrigation projects got a 12 percent higher level of supervision per year than the average Bank project and the average implementation delay for irrigation projects, 1.7 years, was only slightly above the average for all projects. Based on the findings of this study which highlight what has or has not worked and the evolution of Bank policies, recommendations for changes in policy on Bank-supporthed irrigation investments are made.

TI  - Re-allocating yet-to-be-saved water in irrigation modernization projects:The case of the Bittit Irrigation System, Morocco
PY  - 2017
AB  - While the world faces a growing demand for food, water availability is limited. One much proposed and advocated (among others by international donors) solution for producing more food with less available water is the so-called modernization of irrigation systems (Playan and Mateos, 2006; World Bank, 2006; EEA, 2009; OECD, 2010). The term modernization refers to the ‘upgrading’ (Burt, 1999: 15) of irrigation systems through the introduction of new management arrangements and technologies that stimulate efficient water use (van Halsema, 2002). Increases in the efficiency of irrigation systems are expected to result in increases in the productivity of the irrigated sector, as for instance expressed in terms of more production per hectare or more production per cubic meter of available water. Modernization of irrigation is also often associated with a larger agricultural intensification discourse, with farmers becoming more competitive, a liberalization of markets and a reduction in subsidies (Lecina et al., 2010).

TI  - Sustainability analysis for irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region
PY  - 2003
AB  - Sustainable irrigation water management should simultaneously achieve two objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture for food security and preserving the associated natural environment. A stable relationship should be maintained between these two objectives now and in the future, while potential conflicts between these objectives should be mitigated through appropriate irrigation practices. The Aral Sea region in Central Asia is such a region that is most famous for its conflict between sustaining irrigated agriculture and preserving the environment. The current status of irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region demonstrates the Aral Sea disaster as a prime example for unsustainable irrigation development. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework for sustainable irrigation management analysis and applies it to analyze irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region. Based on the modeling outputs, alternative futures of the irrigation practice in the region are explored and it is found that to maintain current irrigation practices will lead to worsening environmental and economic consequences. Investments in infrastructure improvements (about annualized US $299 million) and crop pattern change will be necessary to sustain the irrigated agriculture and the associated environment in the region. Moreover, a penalty tax on salt discharge less than 50 US$ per ton as an economic incentive may help address environmental problems, while having only a small effect on irrigation profit.

TI  - Climate variation explains a third of global crop yield variability
PY  - 2015
AB  - Many studies have examined the role of mean climate change in agriculture, but an understanding of the influence of inter-annual climate variations on crop yields in different regions remains elusive. We use detailed crop statistics time series for ~13,500 political units to examine how recent climate variability led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, >60% of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. Globally, climate variability accounts for roughly a third (~32-39%) of the observed yield variability. Our study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. We discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.

TI  - What role can information play in improved equity in Pakistan’s irrigation system? Evidence from an experimental game in Punjab
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Indus Basin Irrigation System suffers significant inequity in access to surface water across its millions of users. Information, i.e., monitoring and reporting of water availability, may be of value in improving conditions across the basin, and we investigated this via an experimental game of water distribution in Punjab, Pakistan. We found evidence that flow information allowed players to take more effective action to target overuse, and that overall activities that might bring social disapproval were reduced with information. However, we did not find any overall improvement in equity across the system, suggesting that information on its own might not be sufficient to lead to better water distribution among irrigators.

TI  - Hybrid Water Rights Systems for Pro-Poor Water Governance in Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water-permit systems are widely used across Africa as a blanket requirement for small and micro irrigation enterprises, as well as large enterprises. The present study aimed to, first, further understand the implications of permit systems for both the most vulnerable and the state, and, second, based on the findings, identify options for pro-poor water legislation that also meet the water governance requirements of the state. The growing recognition of the importance of farmer-led irrigation development for food security across the continent underlines the importance of these questions. Focusing on Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and other African countries, we found that permit systems criminalized instead of protected the water rights of small-scale farmers. Moreover, little if any attention is paid to the logistical burdens and costs to the state of implementing such systems relative to the intended revenue generation. As many small-scale farmers in Africa were found to operate under customary land and water tenure systems, the study proposes a hybrid system of water rights that formally recognizes such practices, along with the use of permits, including enforcement of conditions for large users, to serve the interests of both the state and small-scale farmers.

TI  - The role of economics in irrigation water management
PY  - 2006
AB  - Economic literature and international conferences have extensively discussed the importance of treating irrigation water as an economic good, but there is still confusion about the role of economics in irrigation water management. Economics provides us with two contributions: analytical tools that help predict and interpret implications of various allocation procedures, and economic instruments that can assist in guiding users towards socially desirable outcomes. In this article the potential role of both contributions to improved irrigation water management is discussed, which is an extension of conventional work in this field. It becomes clear that, at this point in time, there is little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of economic instruments in irrigation water management. Economics mainly plays a role in understanding the implications of different procedures for allocating water, and guiding policymakers in defining appropriate allocation rules

TI  - Soil Degradation Under Irrigation
PY  - 2008
AB  - Irrigation is a precondition for stable crop production in areas characterized by marked variability in rainfall distribution. Despite substantial investment in irrigation projects in the past decades, global irrigated cropland area has hardly grown. Here we discuss the factors related to the sustainability of irrigation and strategies to alleviate them. Water resources deterioration, diversion of water for other uses, and soil degradation are the major factors affecting the environmental sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Water logging results from the tendency to apply water in excess of irrigation requirements. It leads to reduced aeration, nutrient uptake, and crop yields. Salt buildup occurs through the process of capillary rise when the water table rises close to the surface. Salinity risks also increases when saline water is used for irrigation and when poor fertilizer and poor irrigation management are combined. Groundwater drainage is the ultimate precautionary measure against groundwater rise and salt accumulation, but its timely installation is essential for optimal result. Constant soil monitoring and the use of systematic diagnosis testing could also reveal the incipience of soil salinity. Future global warming would likely exacerbate water demand for irrigation with the implications that crops would grow in hotter, drier, and more saline conditions. The ability of irrigated agriculture to meet future challenges would therefore depend on the progress of new research to enhance adaptation to these changes.

TI  - Influence of Spatial Resolution on Remote Sensing-Based Irrigation Performance Assessment Using WaPOR Data
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper analyses the effect of the spatial assessment scale on irrigation performance indicators in small and medium-scale agriculture. Three performance indicators—adequacy (i.e., sufficiency of water use to meet the crop water requirement), equity (i.e., fairness of irrigation distribution), and productivity (i.e., unit of physical crop production/yield per unit water consumption)—are evaluated in five irrigation schemes for three spatial resolutions—250 m, 100 m, and 30 m. Each scheme has varying plot sizes and distributions, with average plot sizes ranging from 0.2 ha to 13 ha. The datasets are derived from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) water productivity through open access of remotely sensed–derived data (the Water Productivity Open Access Portal—WaPOR) database. Irrigation indicators performed differently in different aspects; for adequacy, all three resolutions show similar spatial trends for relative evapotranspiration (ET) across levels for all years. However, the estimation of relative ET is often higher at higher resolution. In terms of equity, all resolutions show similar inter-annual trends in the coefficient of variation (CV); higher resolutions usually have a higher CV of the annual evapotranspiration and interception (ETIa) while capturing more spatial variability. For productivity, higher resolutions show lower crop water productivity (CWP) due to higher aboveground biomass productivity (AGBP) estimations in lower resolutions; they always have a higher CV of CWP. We find all resolutions of 250 m, 100 m, and 30 m suitable for inter-annual and inter-scheme assessments regardless of plot size. While each resolution shows consistent temporal trends, the magnitude of the trend in both space and time is smoothed by the 100 m and 250 m resolution datasets. This frequently results in substantial differences in the irrigation performance assessment criteria for inter-plot comparisons; therefore, 250 m and 100 m are not recommended for inter-plot comparison for all plot sizes, particularly small plots (<2 ha). Our findings highlight the importance of selecting the spatial resolution appropriate to scheme characteristics when undertaking irrigation performance assessment using remote sensing.

TI  - Water trading at the margin: The evolution of water markets in the Murray‐Darling Basin
PY  - 2005
AB  - [1] Water trading in Australia is enabled by much historical institutional development, which had other objectives at the time that it was implemented. After 2 decades of institutional reform to enable water markets in the Murray Darling Basin, active markets are reallocating surface water entitlements among irrigation users. However, permanent water trading is currently limited in terms of the volume traded and reallocation among uses. Given these limitations, this paper seeks to assess the success of surface water markets in the Murray-Darling Basin by comparing current practice against the six desirable characteristics for water markets suggested by Howe et al. (1986). Overall, it is argued that, despite the relatively low rate of reallocation, the market performs well against most criteria but that ongoing evolution of institutional arrangements is critical for improved success.

TI  - Groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
PY  - 2014
AB  - Groundwater exploitation is a major cause of land subsidence, which in coastal areas poses a flood inundation hazard that is compounded by the threat of sea-level rise (SLR). In the lower Mekong Delta, most of which lies <2 m above sea level, over-exploitation is inducing widespread hydraulic head (i.e., groundwater level) declines. The average rate of head decline is ~0.3 m yr−1, based on time-series data from 79 nested monitoring wells at 18 locations. The consequent compaction of sedimentary layers at these locations is calculated to be causing land subsidence at an average rate of 1.6 cm yr−1. We further measure recent subsidence rates (annual average, 2006–10) throughout the Delta, by analysis of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), using 78 ALOS PALSAR interferograms. InSAR-based subsidence rates are 1) consistent with compaction-based rates calculated at monitoring wells, and 2) ~1–4 cm yr−1 over large (1000s of km2) regions. Ours are the first mapped estimates of Delta-wide land subsidence due to groundwater pumping. If pumping continues at present rates, ~0.88 m (0.35–1.4 m) of land subsidence is expected by 2050. Anticipated SLR of ~0.10 m (0.07–0.14 m) by 2050 will compound flood inundation potential. Our results suggest that by mid-century portions of the Mekong Delta will likely experience ~1 m (0.42–1.54 m) of additional inundation hazard.

TI  - Water Markets as an Adaptive Response to Climate Change
PY  - 2014
AB  - The chapter reviews the status of and potential for water markets as an adaptive response to climate change, with implications for developing countries. An analysis of several climate change scenarios suggests increasing pressure on water supplies relative to demand, and points to regions of the world where water markets could help efficiently move water among users. Growing water scarcity and variability due to climate change might well propel development of new water markets given the significant potential of water markets to alleviate growing water stress both in the long run and in response to short term water variability.

Using the Amu and Syr rivers for irrigation reduced the Aral's source water. The sea has become three residual lakes, two of which have salinity rates too high for fish. Surrounding towns and populations have suffered. A dam built in 2005 transformed the northern lake, but the two other lakes could become dead seas.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Economic Indicators for Supporting Water Resources Management Decisions
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper demonstrates that combining spatial land surface data with socio-economic analysis provides a number of indicators to strengthen decision making in integrated water and environmental management. It provides a basis to: track current water consumption in the Inkomati Basin in South-Africa; adjust irrigation water management; select crop types; facilitate planning; estimate crop yields before harvesting, and consequently to forecast market price development. Remote sensing data and economic analysis can also be used to study the spatial distribution of water consumption as an indicator of equity in access to water resources. It even enables identification of farms that consume more irrigation water than formally allocated. Finally, it provides a basis to assess the cost-effectiveness of various ways to reduce agricultural water consumption. So, this approach is potentially useful for determining water consumption, refining water allocation policies, and determining the potential for water transfers through mechanisms such as water trading.

TI  - The responses of agriculture in Europe to climate change
PY  - 2010
AB  - Human activities are projected to lead to substantial increases in temperature that will impact northern Europe during winter and southern Europe during summer. Moreover, it is expected that these changes will cause increasing water shortages along the Mediterranean and in the south-west Balkans and in the south of European Russia. The consequences on the European agricultural ecosystems are likely to vary widely depending on the cropping system being investigated (i.e. cereals vs. forage crops vs. perennial horticulture), the region and the likely climate changes. In northern Europe, increases in yield and expansion of climatically suitable areas are expected to dominate, whereas disadvantages from increases in water shortage and extreme weather events (heat, drought, storms) will dominate in southern Europe. These effects may reinforce the current trends of intensification of agriculture in northern and western Europe and extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean and south-eastern parts of Europe. Among the adaptation options (i.e. autonomous or planned adaptation strategies) that may be explored to minimize the negative impacts of climate changes and to take advantage of positive impacts, changes in crop species, cultivar, sowing date, fertilization, irrigation, drainage, land allocation and farming system seem to be the most appropriate. In adopting these options, however, it is necessary to consider the multifunctional role of agriculture and to strike a variable balance between economic, environmental and economic functions in different European regions.

TI  - Global crop output and irrigation water requirements under a changing climate
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The anthropogenic increases in CO2 atmospheric concentrations are expected to lead to multiple and possibly opposing effects on crop performance with important implications for crop water productivity. The study integrates the global responses to mounting concentrations at three levels – climatic, cropping and economic – to determine the deviations in crop production and irrigation water requirements from a 'no climate change' socioeconomic development storyline. The biophysical effects are considered comprehensively for eight crop classes by taking into account alterations both to rainfed and irrigation yields, and to irrigation water intensities. These changes in crop growing conditions are explored in the 2004–2050 timeframe across two concentrations pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP 8.5) with the inclusion of the CO2 fertilisation effect. The economic responses are determined through a global water CGE model (RESCU-Water) comprising a bottom-up representation of crop systems. Changes in climatic conditions reduce crop output and depress the global water demand for irrigated crops in spite of an increase in irrigation water intensities. Discrepancies in crop production impacts between tropical and temperate regions increase with CO2 concentration levels. Embedding CO2 fertilisation more than offsets these adverse effects by determining a net increase in crop production and a reduction in irrigation water requirements at a regional level. The resulting water savings potential, even in the lower concentrations scenario (RCP2.6), warrant more research with the aim of reducing the different classes of uncertainty regarding the effects of CO2 fertilisation.

TI  - Solar-powered drip irrigation enhances food security in the Sudano-Sahel.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population over the next half-century will require technologies that significantly improve rural livelihoods at minimal environmental cost. These technologies will likely be distinct from those of the Green Revolution, which had relatively little impact in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, few such interventions have been rigorously evaluated. This paper analyzes solar-powered drip irrigation as a strategy for enhancing food security in the rural Sudano–Sahel region of West Africa. Using a matched-pair comparison of villages in northern Benin (two treatment villages, two comparison villages), and household survey and field-level data through the first year of harvest in those villages, we find that solar-powered drip irrigation significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season, and is cost effective compared to alternative technologies.

TI  - Climate impacts on global irrigation requirements under 19 GCMs, simulated with a vegetation and hydrology model
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract This study quantifies global changes in irrigation requirements for areas presently equipped for irrigation of major crop types, using climate projections from 19 GCMs up to the 2080s. Analysis is based on results from the global eco-hydrological model LPJmL that simulates the complex and dynamic interplay of direct and indirect climate change effects upon irrigation requirements. We find a decrease in global irrigation demand by ∼17% in the ensemble median, due to a combination of beneficial CO2 effects on plants, shorter growing periods and regional precipitation increases. In contrast, increases of >20% are projected with a high likelihood (i.e. in more than two thirds of the climate change scenarios) for some regions, including southern Europe, and, with a lower likelihood, for parts of Asia and North America as well. If CO2 effects were not accounted for, however, global irrigation demand would hardly change, and increases would prevail in most regions except for southern Asia (where higher ...

TI  - Current Climate Variability and Future Climate Change: Estimated Growth and Poverty Impacts for Zambia
PY  - 2012
AB  - Economy-wide and hydrological-crop models are combined to assess the economic impacts of historical climate variability and future anthropogenic climate change in Zambia. Accounting for uncertainty, results indicate that, on average, current variability reduces gross domestic product by 4% over a 10-year period and pulls 2% of the population below the poverty line. Socioeconomic impacts are much larger during major drought years, thus underscoring the importance of extreme weather events in determining climate damages. Climate change scenarios draw on projections for 2025. Results indicate that, in the worst case scenario, damages caused by climate change are half the size of those from current variability. The paper concludes that current climate variability, rather than climate change, will remain the more binding constraint on economic development in Zambia, at least over the next few decades.

TI  - Rethinking irrigation modernisation: realising multiple objectives through the integration of fisheries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigation has been, and will remain, instrumental in addressing water security (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6), food insecurity (SDG 2) and poverty (SDG 1) goals. However, the global context in which irrigation takes place is changing rapidly. A call for healthier and more sustainable food systems is placing new demands on how irrigation is developed and managed. Growing pressures from competing water uses in the domestic and industrial sectors, as well increasing environmental awareness, mean irrigation is increasingly called on to perform better, delivering acceptable returns on investment and simultaneously improving food security, rural livelihoods and nutrition, as well as supporting environmental conservation. Better integration of fisheries (including aquaculture) in irrigation planning, investment and management can contribute to the modernisation of irrigation and the achievement of the multiple objectives that it is called on to deliver. A framework illustrating how fisheries can be better integrated with irrigation, and how the two can complement each other across a range of scales, from scheme to catchment and, ultimately, national level, is presented.

TI  - Multiple Uses of Water in Irrigated Areas
PY  - 2001
AB  - Although irrigation systems have long been evaluated andmanaged as though they existed only to produce irrigatedcrops, in fact many irrigation systems also provide water forother uses, especially in much of Asia. The quantities ofwater used in these activities may be small, but these useshave high value in terms of household income, nutrition, andhealth. Recognizing the multiple uses of water in irrigationsystems is critical for better water allocation policy. First,the value of water in irrigation systems has been undervaluedbecause of a failure to recognize the many uses. A moreaccurate assessment that includes all uses will better informdecisions about allocating water (and financial resources)between irrigation and other uses. Second, even withinirrigation systems, taking all uses into account can lead tomore productive and environmentally sustainable use of water.Third, recognizing the rights of all users of water can leadto more equitable and socially sustainable outcomes ofmanagement, rehabilitation, and any proposed reallocation ofwater resources. Recognizing all uses of water makes watermanagement and economic and institutional analyses morecomplex. Because many of the interactions between uses areaffected by water quality at least as much as quantity, italso brings environmental and health issues to the fore. Thisarticle reviews these issues, drawing upon the case studyarticles from Sri Lanka and India, which are presented in thisspecial issue.

TI  - Climate change impacts on irrigation water requirements in the Guadalquivir river basin in Spain
PY  - 2007
AB  - Irrigated production in the Guadalquivir river basin in Spain has grown significantly over the last decade. As a consequence, water resources are under severe pressure, with an increasing deficit between available supplies and water demand. To conserve supplies, the water authority has reduced the volume of water assigned to each irrigation district. Major infrastructural investments have also been made to improve irrigation efficiency, including the adoption of high technology micro-irrigation systems. Within a context of increasing water scarcity, climate change threatens to exacerbate the current supply-demand imbalance. In this study, the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand have been modelled and mapped. Using a combination of crop and geographic information systems, maps showing the predicted spatial impacts of changes in agroclimate (climate variables that determine the irrigation requirements) and irrigation need have been produced. The maps highlight a significant predicted increase in aridity and irrigation need. Modelling of irrigation water requirements shows a typical increase of between 15 and 20% in seasonal irrigation need by the 2050s, depending on location and cropping pattern, coupled with changes in seasonal timing of demand.

TI  - A global, spatially-explicit assessment of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows
PY  - 2017
AB  - When urban areas expand without concomitant increases in wastewater treatment capacity, vast quantities of wastewater are released to surface waters with little or no treatment. Downstream of many urban areas are large areas of irrigated croplands reliant on these same surface water sources. Case studies document the widespread use of untreated wastewater in irrigated agriculture, but due to the practical and political challenges of conducting a true census of this practice, its global extent is not well known except where reuse has been planned. This study used GIS-based modeling methods to develop the first spatially-explicit estimate of the global extent of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows, including indirect wastewater use. These croplands were further classified by their likelihood of using poor quality water based on the spatial proximity of croplands to urban areas, urban wastewater return flow ratios, and proportion of wastewater treated. This study found that 65% (35.9 Mha) of downstream irrigated croplands were located in catchments with high levels of dependence on urban wastewater flows. These same catchments were home to 1.37 billion urban residents. Of these croplands, 29.3 Mha were located in countries with low levels of wastewater treatment and home to 885 million urban residents. These figures provide insight into the key role that water reuse plays in meeting the water and food needs of people around the world, and the need to invest in wastewater treatment to protect public health

TI  - Agricultural nutrient loadings to the freshwater environment: the role of climate change and socioeconomic change
PY  - 2017
AB  - Human activities, in particular agricultural production, interfere with natural cycles of nutrient elements, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), leading to growing concerns about water quality degradation related to excessive nutrient loadings. Increases in agricultural production in response to population growth and wealth generation further increase risks associated with nutrient pollution. This paper presents results from projections of nutrient exports from global agricultural crop and pasture systems to the water environment generated using a process-based modeling approach. Brazil, China, India and the United States account for more than half of estimated global N and P loadings in the base year. Each country boasts large agriculture centers where high calculated loading values are found. Rapid growth in global agricultural nutrient loadings is projected. Growth of agricultural pollution loading is fastest in the group of low-income developing countries and loading growth rates also vary substantially with climate change scenario. Counter measures need to be taken to address the environmental risks associated with the projected rapid increase of agricultural nutrient loadings.

TI  - Playing games to save water: Collective action games for groundwater management in Andhra Pradesh, India
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Groundwater is one of the most challenging common pool resources to govern, resulting in resource depletion in many areas. We present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in Andhra Pradesh, India. The games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. These were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. A slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. Our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. Individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. Either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. After the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same NGO water commons program. Because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. However, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.

TI  - Irrigation in the Indus basin: A history of unsustainability?
PY  - 2007
AB  - The Indus basin civilization (3000–1500 BC) is thought to have collapsed due to the Indus river shifting its course, and unchecked salinization of the irrigated land. Though modern irrigation practices in the Indus basin do not have to worry about the river shifting its course, a priority concern should be the basin9s salt profile. Despite attempts to deal with the problem since the 1960 s, the net result is still an increasing salt balance which threatens the system9s sustainability. This paper explores what it means to manage risk, and then applies these insights to a narrative history of the Indus basin. Particular focus is placed on the basin9s current management since it will shape how irrigation is managed in the future. A key lesson to derive is that given the short-term nature of decision-making in the basin, any significant change has to address the political reality whereby politicians exert influence over water allocations in order to safeguard their political lives.

TI  - On the causes of the shrinking of Lake Chad
PY  - 2011
AB  - Over the last 40 years, Lake Chad, once the sixth largest lake in the world, has decreased by more than 90% in area. In this study, we use a hydrological model coupled with a lake/wetland algorithm to simulate the effects of lake bathymetry, human water use, and decadal climate variability on the lake's level, surface area, and water storage. In addition to the effects of persistent droughts and increasing irrigation withdrawals on the shrinking, we find that the lake's unique bathymetry—which allows its division into two smaller lakes—has made it more vulnerable to water loss. Unfortunately the lake's split is favored by the 1952–2006 climatology. Failure of the lake to remerge with renewed rainfall in the 1990s following the drought years of the 1970s and 1980s is a consequence of irrigation withdrawals. Under current climate and water use, a full recovery of the lake is unlikely without an inter-basin water transfer. Breaching the barrier separating the north and south lakes would reduce the amount of supplemental water needed for recovery.

TI  - The impact of water users' associations on the productivity of irrigated agriculture in Pakistani Punjab
PY  - 2015
AB  - This paper finds productivity-enhancing effects of watercourse-level water users’ associations for farms at the tail of a watercourse and for those that rely exclusively on groundwater – two groups that are marginalized from surface water use and more likely to rely increasingly on groundwater. Yet, heavy reliance on groundwater consumes vast energy resources and leads to environmental degradation through overdraft and groundwater salinization. Improving the management of surface water through functioning watercourse-level institutions can increase use efficiency across water, energy and land resources through increasing agricultural productivity of those now least able to access fresh surface water resources.

TI  - What is the irrigation potential for Africa? A Combined Biophysical and Socioeconomic Approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50%, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

TI  - International water conflict and cooperation: challenges and opportunities
PY  - 2017
AB  - Though awareness of the nature of water conflict and cooperation has improved over time, the likelihood of water conflicts could increase as populations continue to grow and climate change continues to manifest. This article details the nature of water conflict and water cooperation. We discuss how water conflicts can be resolved, how water can be seen as a vehicle for change between states, and future directions that can be taken in transboundary water conflict research.

TI  - Nonsustainable groundwater sustaining irrigation: A global assessment
PY  - 2012
AB  - [1] Water used by irrigated crops is obtained from three sources: local precipitation contributing to soil moisture available for root water uptake (i.e., green water), irrigation water taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and renewable groundwater (i.e., blue water), and irrigation water abstracted from nonrenewable groundwater and nonlocal water resources. Here we quantify globally the amount of nonrenewable or nonsustainable groundwater abstraction to sustain current irrigation practice. We use the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB to simulate gross crop water demand for irrigated crops and available blue and green water to meet this demand. We downscale country statistics of groundwater abstraction by considering the part of net total water demand that cannot be met by surface freshwater. We subsequently confront these with simulated groundwater recharge, including return flow from irrigation to estimate nonrenewable groundwater abstraction. Results show that nonrenewable groundwater abstraction contributes approximately 20% to the global gross irrigation water demand for the year 2000. The contribution of nonrenewable groundwater abstraction to irrigation is largest in India (68 km3 yr−1) followed by Pakistan (35 km3 yr−1), the United States (30 km3 yr−1), Iran (20 km3 yr−1), China (20 km3 yr−1), Mexico (10 km3 yr−1), and Saudi Arabia (10 km3 yr−1). Results also show that globally, this contribution more than tripled from 75 to 234 km3 yr−1 over the period 1960–2000.

TI  - Irrigation systems as multiple-use commons: Water use in Kirindi Oya, Sri Lanka
PY  - 1999
AB  - Irrigation systems are recognized as common pool resources supplying water for agricultural production, but their role in supplying water for other uses is often overlooked. The importance of non-agricultural uses of irrigation water in livelihood strategies has implications for irrigation management and water rights, especially as increasing scarcity challenges existing water allocation mechanisms. This paper examines the multiple uses of water in the Kirindi Oya irrigation system in Sri Lanka, who the users are, and implications for water rights and management policies. There are important residential, gender, and class differences among the water users. People use irrigation system water not only for field crops, but also for fishing, homestead gardens, and livestock. Even within irrigated farming households, men have more control over paddy crops in the main fields, whereas homestead gardens are women's domain. Because the irrigation system provides water for birds and animals, even wildlife and non-resident environmental groups can be considered stakeholders. Current policies emphasize user involvement in both irrigation and domestic water supply. While government agencies have had primary responsibility, institutions such as Farmers' Organizations are being promoted. These have the potential to serve as user platforms for negotiating water allocation among irrigated farmers. However, the user organizations reflect the sectoral responsibility of the government agencies. Their membership and structure do not take into account the multiple uses or users of water. Developing platforms that accommodate different user groups remains a major challenge for improving the overall productivity, as well as equity, of water use.

TI  - Pricing irrigation water: a review of theory and practice
PY  - 2002
AB  - Increasing economic pressures on water resources are causing countries to (re)consider various mechanisms to improve water use efficiency. This is especially true for irrigation agriculture, a major consumer of water. ‘‘Getting prices right’’ is seen as one way to allocate water, but how to accomplish this remains a debatable issue. Methods of allocating water are sensitive to physical, social, institutional and political settings, making it necessary to design allocation mechanisms accordingly. This paper surveys current and past views on allocating irrigation water with a focus on efficiency, equity, water institutions, and the political economy of water allocation. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - The effects of irrigation on poverty: a framework for analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on rural poverty in India: An aggregate panel-data analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - The main objective of this study is to quantify the marginal impacts of irrigation and selected input factors on spatial (across 14 states) and temporal (from 1970–1993) variation in the rural poverty level in India. The study uses the head count ratio measure (percent of population below the poverty line) of poverty to evaluate how the poverty level is affected by input factors: irrigation, adoption of HYVs, fertilizer application, rural literacy rate and rural road density. It was found that marginal (incremental) impacts of irrigation followed by the rural literacy rate were larger in explaining the variation of rural poverty level in India than those of other factor-inputs selected. The marginal impact of groundwater irrigation on poverty reduction was larger than that of canal irrigation, which is due to greater control in the application and widespread use of groundwater irrigation than of canal irrigation. Despite mixed findings about the impact of irrigation on poverty from past studies, we have found large-scale marginal impacts of irrigation on rural poverty in India. This quantitative information is expected to be useful for designing targeted poverty alleviation and rural development strategies that also enhance agricultural-productivity growth.
