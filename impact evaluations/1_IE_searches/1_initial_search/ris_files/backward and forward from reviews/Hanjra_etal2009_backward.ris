TI  - Assessing the impact of the Green Revolution, 1960 to 2000
PY  - 2003
AB  - We summarize the findings of a recently completed study of the productivity impacts of international crop genetic improvement research in developing countries. Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of “modern varieties” for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions.

TI  - Education and Technical Efficiency during the Green Revolution in Pakistan
PY  - 1991
AB  - tion is more likely to arise during disequilibrium caused by technical change. In agriculture this may be because technical change renders the existing cultural practices obsolete or inadequate and calls for an adjustment. A more educated farmer is supposed to make the required adjustment more quickly. This article tests the foregoing hypothesis in Pakistan agriculture during the Green Revolution when introduction of new crop varieties disturbed the prevailing equilibrium. For this purpose a production function approach is used and the analysis is conducted not only for the new crop varieties but also for their traditional counterparts. The results lend support to the hypothesis by showing that the worker effect is stronger for new crop varieties than it is for traditional ones. The article is divided into five sections. In the next section a brief review of the literature is presented. Section III presents the hypothesis and discusses the methodology used for the analysis. The results and their policy implications are discussed in Section IV, and Section V concludes the article. II.

TI  - The impact of research-led agricultural productivity growth on poverty reduction in Africa, Asia and Latin America
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Twenty-percent of the world’s population, or 1.2 billion live on less than $1 per day; 70% of these are rural and 90% are in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Research-led technological change in agriculture generates sufficient productivity growth to give high rates of return in Africa and Asia and has a substantial impact on poverty, currently reducing this number by 27 million per annum, whereas productivity growth in industry and services has no impact. The per capita “cost” of poverty reduction by means of agricultural research expenditures in Africa is $144 and in Asia $180, or 50 cents per day, but this is covered by output growth. By contrast, the per capita cost for the richer countries of Latin America is over $11,000.

TI  - Equity and productivity assessments in the Olifants River basin, South Africa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Emerging approaches to water resources development and management typically highlight equity and productivity as two main objectives. In the context of integrated water resources management within a river basin, managers and stakeholders often need a comparative assessment of different options for water augmentation and/or allocation. Pitting such options against predefined objectives, such as equity and productivity, requires an assessment of the effects that available options will have on these objectives. Available documentation indicates that not only does the interpretation of such objectives vary widely, but also the available methods for assessing equity and productivity run into significant limitations in the availability of adequate data. This limitation has largely kept decision makers from gaining a comprehensive overview of equity and productivity scenarios, whether within or across sectors, that could facilitate better-informed decisions. To address this methodological gap, this article scrutinizes different notions associated with equity and water productivity, and limitations in prevalent assessment methods with the view to develop and demonstrate pragmatic methodologies for assessing equity and productivity in data-scarce contexts. The discussion and findings are based on a review of relevant literature and empirical and consultative research work in the Olifants River basin in South Africa. The demonstrated methodologies for assessing equity and productivity, besides being useful in data-scarce contexts, are insightful for initiating several policy measures and also for exploring the relationship between equity and water productivity.

TI  - Land tenure and common pool resources in rural Ethiopia: A study based on fifteen sites
PY  - 2002
AB  - The evolution of land tenure in Ethiopia during the Imperial period directed towards private and individualized property is discussed both in general terms and by examining conditions at specific localities. This evolution was brought to an abrupt end by the land reform of 1975 with nationalization. The same logic of subsistence agriculture as in traditional tenures seems to be the basis for the reform. With the abandonment of the socialist transformation of agriculture no vision about future developments in land tenure seems to exist. Privatization is suggested to improve the security of land holding, to increase agricultural investment, to assist the development of other markets as well as preserve common pool resources. L’article etudie l’evolution du regime foncier ethiopien sous l’empire, d’un point de vue general et examinant la situation specifique de certaines localites. Cette evolution, vers une propriete privee et individualisee des terres, a ete brutalement interrompue par les nationalisations conduites dans le cadre de la reforme agraire de 1975. Celle-ci semble s’etre appuyee sur la meme logique d’agriculture de subsistance que celle qui sous-tendait les regimes fonciers traditionnels. Aujourd’hui, la transformation socialiste de l’agriculture ayant ete abandonnee, il ne semble exister aucune vision pour l’evolution future du regime foncier. Un programme de privatisation est suggere pour ameliorer la securite du regime de possession des terres, accroitre l’investissement agricole, faciliter le developpement d’autres marches et preserver les ressources communes.

TI  - The impact of changes in human fertility on poverty
PY  - 1999
AB  - Household survey data for developing and transitional economies are used to estimate the effect of fertility (crude birth rate net of infant deaths) on private consumption poverty. Cross‐national regressions indicate that higher fertility increases poverty both by retarding economic growth and by skewing distribution against the poor. Our median country in 1980 had ‘dollar‐a‐day’ poverty incidence of 18.9 per cent; had it reduced its fertility by four per 1,000 throughout the 1980s (the sample median fall), it is estimated that incidence would have been reduced to 13.9 per cent, the growth and distribution effects being roughly equally responsible for this reduction.

TI  - Heterogeneity in returns to schooling: Econometric evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2005
AB  - This paper investigates whether returns to schooling in Ethiopia vary across the wage distribution of individuals. To do so, it adopts an instrumental variables quantile regression framework that allows for both endogeneity of schooling resulting from unmeasured ability, and possible heterogeneity in the impact of schooling. The empirical estimates indicate that education contributes more to the earnings of individuals at a lower end of the income distribution.

TI  - Contrasting water management techniques in Tunisia: towards sustainable agricultural use
PY  - 2003
AB  - Tunisia is a marginal country hydrologically and it has adopted a number of distinctive methods of water management for agriculture. The central region supports modern dam irrigation, whilst traditional rainwater harvesting is practiced in the south. These contrasting techniques are described and evaluated in terms of sustainability using empirical field data and secondary literature for two study sites. Research focuses primarily on the physical environment, but socio-cultural and economic viability are also examined. Analysis indicates that traditional water management advantageously partitions the continuum dividing hazards and resources through subtle manipulation of the environment. A potentially hazardous environment is rendered secure by resourceful water management based on community action and cumulative knowledge. This practice minimizes community dependency and local economic imbalance. With dam irrigation, carrying capacity is established more forcibly by centralized control in order to place society within world markets. An almost total break from environmental variability is made in the short term, but this can lead to disequilibrium over longer durations. Additionally, the spatial and social distributions of development are uneven. In Tunisia, maintenance of traditional methods can reduce the negative impacts caused by modern programmes and support their positive characteristics. A mix of both methods offers a foundation to sustainable water supply in the new millennium.

TI  - Simulating the impact of policy upon chronic and transitory poverty in rural Pakistan
PY  - 2000
AB  - Anti‐poverty programmes often seek to improve their impact by targeting households for assistance according to welfare measures in a single time period. However, a growing literature shows the importance to poor households of fluctuations in their welfare from month to month and year to year. This study uses a five‐year panel of 686 households from rural Pakistan to investigate the magnitude of chronic or transitory poverty making an explicit adjustment for measurement error. The impact of two types of policies (those designed to ‘smooth’ incomes and those designed to promote income growth) on the severity of chronic and transitory poverty is examined. Since the largest part of the squared poverty gap in our sample is transitory, large reductions in poverty can be achieved by interventions designed to ‘smooth’ incomes, but reducing chronic poverty in the long‐term requires large and sustained growth in household incomes. The level and variability of incomes is then modelled as a function of household char...

PY  - 2004
AB  - We provide evidence on the link between infrastructure development and the distribution of income for the period 1960–97. We use roads, railways, telecommunications, and energy measures. The approach is comprehensive as individual measures and composite indices are used. Cross-country and panel regressions are applied. In the latter, we apply GMM dynamic methods to minimize for endogeneity problems. We find that both quantity and quality of infrastructure are negatively linked with income inequality. The quantitative link tends to be stronger in developing countries than the qualitative link. These findings hold when using different econometric methods and most infrastructure measures.

TI  - Irrigation and poverty alleviation: review of the empirical evidence
PY  - 2004
AB  - L'objectif de cette etude est de clarifier les relations entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete en offrant une revue objective de la recherche recente sur le sujet. Les questions cles abordees ici sont: (1) quel est le role du developpement et de la gestion de l'irrigation sur la reduction de la pauvrete? (2) quels sont les articulations et chemins par lesquels l'irrigation contribue a reduire la pauvrete? (3) quelle est l'ampleur des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? et (4) quels sont les facteurs cles des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? Notre revue se focalise sur des etudes empiriques d'actualite en Asie. La revue approfondie entreprise suggere qu'il y a de fortes connections entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete. Ces connections sont a la fois directes et indirectes. Les connections directes agissent a travers des effets localises et a l'echelle des foyers, tandis que les connections indirectes operent a travers des impacts collectifs ou a l'echelle sub-nationale et nationale. L'irrigation beneficie aux pauvres par le biais d'une production accrue, de rendements plus eleves, d'un plus faible risque d'echec cultural et d'une meilleure situation de l'emploi tout au long de l'annee, dans les exploitations comme en dehors. L'irrigation permet aux petits producteurs d'adopter des cultures plus diversifiees et de passer d'une production de subsistance, de faible valeur, a une production de forte valeur, orientee vers le marche. L'augmentation de la production donne acces aux pauvres a une nourriture abordable. Les connections indirectes operent a travers des effets a l'echelle regionale, nationale et de l'economie. Les investissements en irrigation agissent comme des modificateurs de production et d'approvisionnement, et ont d'importants effets positifs sur la croissance, beneficiant aux pauvres sur le long terme. Au-dela de ceci, les benefices de l'irrigation reviennent aussi aux pauvres et sans-terres sur le long terme, malgre le fait que, sur un plus court terme, les benefices vers ceux qui n'ont pas ou peu de terres peuvent etre faibles du fait que l'allocation de l'eau tend a etre basee sur les terres. En depit de cela, les pauvres et sans-terres beneficient, a la fois en termes absolus et relatifs, des investissements en irrigation. De recentes avancees dans les technologies d'irrigation, par exemple les systemes de micro-irrigation, ont un fort potentiel anti-pauvrete. Des etudes en cours dans des pays asiatiques supportent fortement le fait que l'irrigation aide a reduire a la fois la pauvrete permanente et temporaire. Au-dela de ceci, l'irrigation aide a alleger la pauvrete dans ses pires formes, nommement la pauvrete chronique. En general, l'irrigation augmente la productivite, favorise la croissance et reduit la pauvrete. Des exemples d'effets d'externalites negatives associes a des systemes irrigues de grande et moyenne echelle pointent vers des problemes de gestion, appelant par consequent a des mecanismes de reponse plus englobants de la part des communautes politiques et de gestion. Les impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation peuvent etre intensifies en creant les conditions ou les environnements qui permettraient de realiser une inclusion fonctionnelle des pauvres. Ces conditions et environnements comprennent: (1) un acces equitable a la terre; (2) une gestion integree des ressources en eau; (3) un acces a de l'eau de surface et souterraine de bonne qualite et en quantite adequate; (4) une technologie moderne de production; (5) un passage a une production a forte valeur ajoutee, orientee vers le marche; et (6) des opportunites pour la vente des produits agricoles a faibles couts transactionnels. Les benefices de l'irrigation aux pauvres peuvent etre intensifies en initiant

TI  - The incidence of land tenure insecurity in Southern Africa: Policy implications for sustainable development
PY  - 2007
AB  - The study presented in this article used a combination of key informant interviews and a review and synthesis of existing country level literature to identify the major sources of land tenure insecurity in six Southern African countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia. Findings reveal that the main causes of land tenure insecurity experienced in Southern Africa include lack of land rights of minority groups, unclear or overlapping land rights, overcrowding, land alienation into leasehold, insecurity of farm workers and farm labour tenants, inappropriate and exploitative administrative practices, land encroachment and illegal settlers and limited women's land rights. The article presents a summary of land tenure security related initiatives that the study countries have or are in the process of adopting. Analysis of these initiatives shows that tenure reforms have focused on changing the law and rules but little has been done to translate new laws into implementable programs; capacity building; prioritization of resources to support tenure reform; provision of complementary policies and incentives; addressing HIV/AIDS-land tenure related problems; and monitoring and evaluation. The paper contends that these policy issues should be addressed in order to ensure realization of land tenure security for all.

TI  - Drip irrigation for small farmers. A new initiative to alleviate hunger and poverty
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Despite the impressive gains in global food production over the last half century, an estimated 790 million people remain hungry. Many of the chronically hungry are poor farm families, who have neither the means to produce the food they need nor sufficient income to purchase it. For them, access to irrigation water, or the means to use the water they have more productively, is a key to increasing their crop production, their incomes, and their household food security. Ironically, a technology typically associated with wealthy farmers, drip irrigation, may hold the key to alleviating a significant share of rural hunger and poverty. A new spectrum of drip systems keyed to different income levels and farm sizes (beginning with a US$5 bucket kit for home gardens) now exists and can from the backbone of a second green revolution, this one aimed specifically at poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We describe the experience with affordable drip irrigation to date, including its ...

TI  - Agricultural groundwater use and rural livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa: A first-cut assessment
PY  - 2005
AB  - The rapid expansion in agricultural groundwater use in the last few decades has transformed rural economies in large parts of the developing world, in particular South Asia and North China. There has been no such “Groundwater Revolution” in most of sub-Saharan Africa and little is known about the actual role of groundwater use in supporting agricultural livelihoods in the region or opportunities to expand this role in the future. Published literature has been reviewed to paint a preliminary, region-wide picture of the contribution groundwater makes to agriculture, and in turn to rural livelihoods, within sub-Saharan Africa. The findings indicate that groundwater is used on only 1–2 million hectares of cropped area, directly contributing to the livelihoods of 1.5–3% of the rural population. Groundwater also plays a critical role in the vital livestock sector as well as an important indirect role in the supply of domestic water to agricultural households. While data are lacking, these latter two roles likely surpass the direct importance of groundwater to crop production. This suggests that an understanding of the value of agricultural groundwater use in support of rural livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa should be based on different models than have typically been applied in Asia.

TI  - Irrigation Development and Rural Poverty in Gujarat, India: A Disaggregated Analysis
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract There has been renewed interest during recent times in the impact of irrigation development on rural poverty. For long, researchers asked whether irrigation development reduces the poverty of irrigators. However, the question being asked now is: does investing in irrigation—rather than in other public works—help reduce rural poverty in a region? Using Government of Gujarat's 1997 census of Below Poverty Line (BPL) households as well as the Village Amenity Survey of the same year, this paper explores the interplay between irrigation development and rural poverty in 177 predominantly rural talukas, which is an administrative unit with a population of around 100,000-150,000 people, of Gujarat state in western India. Our analysis shows that for the design of poverty-targeting programs, two variables have the highest appeal: primary education infrastructure and improved land productivity through irrigation. It also suggests that, over the long run, irrigation benefits far transcend the command areas o...

TI  - Technological change and the distribution of schooling: evidence from green-revolution India
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract In this paper, we develop a two-strata general-equilibrium model of human capital acquisition with endogenous school construction that permits an assessment of the relative impacts of technological change and school availability on schooling investments in landless and landed households and illuminates how these choices interact through the adult and child labor markets. The implications of the model are tested using a unique household-level panel data set which constitutes a representative sample of rural India during the peak period of agricultural innovation associated with the green revolution, 1968–1982. The empirical results indicate that the operation of the market for child labor worsens the distributional impact of agricultural productivity on school investment across landless and landed households, as landless child labor is used to replace landed child labor lost due to increased child school attendance in landed households. The results also suggest, however, that the allocation of school construction diminishes the adverse impact of technical change on the gap between landless and landed schooling investment.

TI  - Washing away poverty: Water, democracy and gendered poverty eradication in South Africa
PY  - 2004
AB  - This article discusses ways in which the South African Government and grassroots organizations envisage and implement democracy achieved since 1994 in the field of water resources management. The focus is on the democratic, political and economic freedom and equality in resource rights for poor black women, who are central to poverty eradication. While the new water policy and law provide an enabling framework for achieving these goals, implementation on the ground encounters both new opportunities and constraints. This is illustrated by several cases of establishing South Africa's new water management institutions: catchment management agencies and water user associations. The important nexus between state-led democratization of water resources management and bottom-up grassroots movements is also discussed. The article concludes that the Government's affirmative and targeted intervention is indispensable for redressing gender inequalities and eradicating poverty.

TI  - Income Distribution Impacts of Irrigation Water Distribution Policy
PY  - 1984
AB  - In the majority of lesser developed countries (LDC's) there is acute inequality in income distribution in the rural sector, particularly between large and small farms on the one hand and between land owners and the landless on the other. Irrigation water distribution policy of the government is both an economic and political problem. It has both equity and efficiency implications. It has effects on both the level and distribution of income. This paper deals with the conditions under which using water redistribution as an effective governmental policy variable can reduce inequality in the distribution of income. This paper also deals with the relationship between the objectives of equity and efficiency in water distribution under different objective realities, such as dualistic versus nondualistic conditions, two-sector versus three-sector modeling, optimum versus equal water distribution, specifically to derive the conditions under which promotion of equity promotes efficiency and vice versa and the conditions under which it does not.

TI  - GROWTH AND SHOCKS: EVIDENCE FROM RURAL ETHIOPIA
PY  - 2004
AB  - Using panel data from rural Ethiopia, the article discusses the determinants of consumption growth (1989–1997), based on a microgrowth model, controlling for heterogeneity. Consumption grew substantially, but with diverse experiences across villages and individuals. Rainfall shocks have a substantial impact on consumption growth, which persists for many years. There also is a persistent growth impact from the large-scale famine in the 1980s, as well as substantial externalities from road infrastructure. The persistent effects of rainfall shocks and the famine crisis imply that welfare losses due to the lack of insurance and protection measures are well beyond the welfare cost of short-term consumption fluctuations.

TI  - Factors affecting demand for fertilizer in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper evaluates different strategies to make significant improvements in fertilizer supply to smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan African (SSA). Use of supply chain analysis is advocated as a means of identifying entry points where targeted interventions can shift the fertilizer supply curve to the right. The growing contrast between the role played by fertilizer in other regions and the very limited use of fertilizer in SSA has stimulated debate about the role of fertilizer in Africa, and what types of policies and programs are needed to realize its potential benefits. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge and the key debates concerning fertilizer demand in SSA. Technical, economic, and policy issues are addressed. An important component of this assumption is that programs are needed to encourage economically sound and technically efficient fertilizer use, not simply increased use. This paper concludes: A shift in the demand curve is likely to elicit a greater increase in aggregate demand than a simple movement along the demand curve in response to a lower fertilizer price. Effective demand for fertilizer is based on farmers' perceptions of fertilizer response, which may differ from the response observed by scientists. Hence, potential demand can be increased through agricultural research that identifies more fertilizer responsive crop varieties and land husbandry practices that increase fertilizer efficiency and reduce production risk.

PY  - 2007
AB  - The authors report new estimates of measures of absolute poverty for the developing world over 1981-2004. A clear trend decline in the percentage of people who are absolutely poor is evident, although with uneven progress across regions. They find more mixed success in reducing the total number of poor. Indeed, the developing world outside China has seen little or no sustained progress in reducing the number of poor, with rising poverty counts in some regions, notably Sub-Saharan Africa. There are encouraging signs of progress in reducing the incidence of poverty in all regions after 2000, although it is too early to say if this is a new trend.

TI  - The Social Rate of Return on Infrastructure Investments - The social rate of return on infrastructure investments
PY  - 1999
AB  - The authors estimate social rates of return to electricity-generating capacity and paved roads, relative to the return on general capital, by examining the effect on aggregate output and comparing that effect with the costs of construction. They find that both types of infrastructure capital are highly complementary with other physical capital and human capital, but have rapidly diminishing returns if increased in isolation. The complementarities on the one hand, and diminishing returns on the other, point to the existence of an optimal mix of capital inputs, making it very easy for a country to have too much - or too little - infrastructure. For policy purposes, the authors compare the rate of return for investing in infrastructure with the estimated rate of return to capital. The strong complementarity between physical and human capital, and the lower prices of investment goods in industrial economies, means that the rate of return to capital as a whole is just as high in rich countries as in the poorest countries but is highest in the middle-income (per capita) countries. In most countries the rates of return to both electricity-generating capacity and paved roads are on a par with, or lower than, rates of return on other forms of capital. But in a few countries there is evidence of acute shortages of electricity-generating capacity and paved roads and, therefore, excess returns to infrastructure investment. Excess returns are evidence of suboptimal investment that, in the case of paved roads, appears to follow a period of sustained economic growth during which road-building stocks have lagged behind investments in other types of capital. This effect is accentuated by the fact that the relative costs of road construction are lower in middle-income countries than in poorer and richer countries. As a rule, a tendency to infrastructure shortages - signaled by higher social rates of return to paved roads or electricity-generating capacity than to other forms of capital - is symptomatic of certain income classes of developing countries: electricity capacity in the poorest, paved roads in the middle-income group. To the extent that such high rates of return are not detected by microeconomic cost-benefit analysis, they suggest macroeconomic externalities associated with infrastructure.

TI  - Farm productivity and rural poverty in India
PY  - 1998
AB  - Armed with new data, we return to an old question from the pages of this journal: to what extent do India's rural poor share in agricultural growth? Combining data from 24 household sample surveys spanning 35 years with other sources, we estimate a model of the joint determination of consumption‐poverty measures, agricultural wages, and food prices. We find that higher farm productivity brought both absolute and relative gains to poor rural households. A large share of the gains was via wages and prices, though these effects took time. The benefits to the poor were not confined to those near the poverty line.

TI  - Assessment of the contribution of irrigation to poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods
PY  - 2004
AB  - Irrigation in developing countries tends to be stereotyped as equity reducing, in competition with other uses for scarce water resources, and often resulting in negative impacts for women and other disadvantaged groups. Agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction is examined. There are four inter‐related mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can reduce poverty. These are: improvements in the levels and security of productivity, employment and incomes for irrigating farm households and farm labour; the linkage and multiplier effects of agricultural intensification for the wider economy; provision of opportunities for diversification of rural livelihoods; and multiple uses of irrigation supply. There are also significant risks that badly designed and managed irrigation can negatively impact on poverty. It is concluded that irrigated farming varies widely in its form and impacts, and has diverse local attributes. Water resource management decis...

TI  - Social learning, neighborhood effects, and investment in human capital: Evidence from Green-Revolution India
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract This paper empirically identifies social learning and neighborhood effects in schooling investments in a new technology regime. Social learning implies that learning is most efficient when observed heterogeneity in schooling is greatest. The estimates of learning-investment rule, from farm household panel data at the onset of the Green Revolution in India, show that (i) agents learn about schooling returns from income realizations of their neighbors, and (ii) the speed of learning is high when the variation of schooling is large. Thus, schooling distribution of the parents' generation in a community has externalities to schooling investments in children. Simulations show that the variations in schooling within and across communities generate variations in child enrollment rate and average household income.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation Dams, Agricultural Production, and Health: Theory and Evidence from Ethiopia - Small-scale irrigation dams, agricultural production, and health - theory and evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2005
AB  - The author looks at the feasibility and potential of instituting small-scale irrigation dams to reduce Ethiopias dependence on rainfed agriculture and the associated food insecurity. He develops a theoretical framework to assess the welfare implications of irrigation development programs and provides empirical evidence from microdam construction and reforestation projects in northern Ethiopia. The author pays particular attention to health-related costs of establishing small-scale irrigation dams in areas prone to waterborne diseases. While the theoretical analyses imply that the net welfare impacts of irrigation dams cannot be known a priori due to potential health costs, the empirical evidence shows that current agricultural yield and farm profit have increased in villages with closer proximity to the dams than in those more distant. The increased disease incidence due to standing pools of water has, however, led to significant declines in the returns from investment in irrigation water. Households with poor health are less likely to adopt productivity-enhancing as well as resource-conserving technologies, which are crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable agricultural development. The ensuing sickness has also led to reduction in labor allocation to off-farm activities. The findings underline the importance of weighing beforehand the magnitude of potential economic benefits against health costs of water development programs. The overall evidence, however, suggests that carefully designed irrigation dams could significantly improve agricultural production and food security, particularly in areas where waterborne diseases pose negligible risk to health or can be cost-effectively controlled.

TI  - Improving Wheat Productivity in Pakistan: Econometric Analysis Using Panel Data from Chaj in the Upper Indus Basin
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract Increasing water scarcity, degradation of land and water resources, continuing low agricultural productivity, and increasing populations are posing the largest ever challenges for development of agricultural economies in many developing countries including Pakistan. Using panel data from irrigated settings in Chaj sub-basin of the Indus basin in Pakistani Punjab, we attempt to: (a) analyze the causes of low productivity; (b) disentangle factors (both land, water and other factors) contributing to productivity variations; and (c) identify limits and opportunities for narrowing productivity gaps and increasing overall wheat production, with a view to enhance food security for the poor. The results of the study indicate that locational inequities in distribution of canal water, use of groundwater of varying quality, differences in use of seed varieties, and other inputs lead to significant variations in wheat productivity. Key implications are that large gains in wheat productivity are possible by (...

TI  - Are Returns to Investment Lower for the Poor? Human and Physical Capital Interactions in Rural Vietnam
PY  - 2000
AB  - A revised version is forthcoming in Review of Development Economics. Unless disparities in education are addressed, market-oriented reforms will generate inequitable agricultural growth in Vietnam. If the marginal gains from investment in physical capital depend positively on knowledge, but a household cannot hire skilled labor to compensate for low skills, then even if it has access to credit the household will achieve lower returns than an educated household. If, as is common, the income-poor are less educated because of failures in the credit market and because they live in areas where there is less access to schooling, then the poor will also have lower returns on investments. Van de Walle tests this argument for the case of irrigation infrastructure in Vietnam. She asks how a household's education level and demographic characteristics influence the gains to household income from irrigating previously unirrigated land. The net marginal benefit of irrigation increases strongly with the education of a household. The results suggest that unless disparities in education are addressed, market-oriented reforms will generate inequitable agricultural growth in Vietnam. This paper - a product of Public Economics, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to understand the determinants of poverty and the policy implications.

TI  - Sustainable land and water management policies and practices: a pathway to environmental sustainability in large irrigation systems
PY  - 2008
AB  - Water cycle, land management, and environmental sustainability are intimately linked. Sustainable land and water management practices are vital for sustaining agricultural productivity and regional development. Unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity constraint over long periods can impose significant costs in terms of lost opportunities in farm production and regional development, say by causing waterlogging and salinity. On-farm and regional salt and water balance dynamics are modeled as a sustainability or carrying capacity constraint, proxied by regional salt and water balance; on-farm land and water management practices are then adjusted to meet the constraint, such that individual actions do not lead to a net change in the ground water and salt balance. Common actions across the farms would achieve the overall environmental sustainability. An irrigated area in southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia serves as a case study example. Integrated hydrologic, economic, agricultural, and environmental models called SWAGMAN series are used to evaluate the impacts of a range of on-farm interventions on farm income and environmental sustainability. The results show that policies such as restrictions on area under certain crops, and tradable groundwater recharge/salinity credits both offer higher total gross margin and net present value than the business as usual scenario, specifically in the long run—win–win options for the farmers and the environment. The modeling results thus confirm the widely held view that unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity can impose significant costs on regional communities. In-depth hydrological and economic analyses are needed to shape and guide society's vision for sustainable land and water management. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Higher education and economic growth in Africa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract This paper uses panel data over the 1960–2000 period, a modified neoclassical growth equation, and a dynamic panel estimator to investigate the effect of higher education human capital on economic growth in African countries. We find that all levels of education human capital, including higher education human capital, have positive and statistically significant effect on the growth rate of per capita income in African counties. Our result differs from those of earlier research that find no significant relationship between higher education human capital and income growth. We estimate the growth elasticity of higher education human capital to be about 0.09, an estimate that is twice as large as the growth impact of physical capital investment. While this is likely to be an overestimate of the growth impact of higher education, it is robust to different specifications and points to the need for African countries to effectively use higher education human capital in growth policies.

TI  - Agricultural Growth Linkages in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - NA
AB  - How much extra net income growth can be had in rural areas of Africa by increasing the spending power of local households? The answer depends on how rural households spend increments to income, whether the items desired can be imported to the local area in response to increased demand, and, if not, whether increased demand will lead to new local production or simply to price rises. For every dollar in new farm income earned, at least one additional dollar could be realized from growth multipliers, according to Agricultural Growth Linkages in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Creating wealth from groundwater for dollar-a-day farmers: Where the silent revolution and the four revolutions to end rural poverty meet
PY  - 2006
AB  - More than 550 million of the current 1.1 billion people earning less than $1-a-day earn a living from agriculture in developing countries. A revolution in water control is needed to develop and mass-disseminate new, affordable, small-plot irrigation technologies. A revolution in agriculture is required to enable smallholders to produce high-value, marketable, labor-intensive cash crops. A revolution in markets is needed to open access to markets for the crops they produce and the inputs they need to produce them. Finally, a revolution in design, based on the ruthless pursuit of affordability, is needed to harness shallow groundwater. The experiences of suppliers of treadle pumps, low-cost drip irrigation and water storage systems were examined. The wealth these technologies generated, coupled with falling prices for small diesel pumps in countries like India and China, created a suitable environment for the rapid adoption of affordable diesel pump tubewells, which in turn created vigorous water markets and expanded access to affordable irrigation water for smallholders. The combination of smallholder-centered revolutions, along with the ‘silent revolution in groundwater’ described by Llamas and Martinez-Santos (Water Sci Technol 51(8):167–174, 2005) provide new practical options for meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty and hunger by 2015.

TI  - Infrastructure and Aggregate Agricultural Productivity: International Evidence
PY  - 1983
AB  - A relationship has long been recognized between a country's agricultural development and its investment in infrastructure capital, such as transportation and communication facilities, that is not directly related to the agricultural production process. The relevant literature spans Adam Smith's proposition "That the Division of Labour is Limited by the Extent of the Market"; the work of von Thtinen; numerous studies by historians and economic historians; and the work of economists such as Schultz, Kuznets, Wharton, Owens, and Johnston and Kilby, to mention a few.' Despite the apparently widespread recognition and acceptance that a relationship exists between agricultural development and infrastructural development, few, if any, empirical studies test this as a hypothesis and provide estimates of the magnitude of such a relationship.2 The aim of this paper is to utilize 1965 aggregate agricultural production data and the concept of the aggregate production function to study the effects of transportation and communication infrastructure on aggregate agricultural productivity. The aggregate data come from 47 less developed countries (LDCs) and 19 developed countries (DCs); the sample countries are listed in the Appendix. The use of intercountry comparisons for development studies dates to Clark and the pioneering work of Kuznets, and it has been exploited econometrically by Chenery.3 An important contribution to the study of international agricultural productivity was made by Hayami and Ruttan, who showed that an aggregate agricultural production function that accounts for intercountry differences in resource endowments, technical (modern) inputs, and human capital can explain a large proportion of the variation in aggregate agricultural output across more and less developed agricultures.4 Evenson and Kislev modified Hayami and Ruttan's model by including a variable measuring each country's investment in agricultural research.5 Essentially the same

TI  - Irrigation, agricultural performance, and poverty reduction in China
PY  - 2006
AB  - The overall goal of our paper is to understand the impact that irrigation in China has had on grain production and incomes, in general, and income and poverty alleviation in poor areas, in particular. The paper seeks to meet three objectives. First, we describe the relationship among irrigation status, yields and household crop revenue. Second, we seek to understand the magnitude and nature of the effect that irrigation has on yields and crop revenue. Finally, we seek to understand the impact that irrigation has on incomes in poor areas. Our analysis shows that irrigation contributes to increases in yields for almost all crops and in income for farmers in all areas. The importance of crop income in poor areas and the strong relationship between crop revenue and irrigation provides evidence of the importance of irrigation in past and future poverty alleviation in China. We also show that in the majority of the villages that invested in new irrigation, returns are positive even after accounting for increases in capital and production costs. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Income and Savings Among Large-scale Farm Households in Eastern Sudan: An Empirical Investigation
PY  - 1999
AB  - ABSTRACT The Sudanese economy is based on agriculture, which offers the best opportunities for achieving food security and reversing the trend of general economic decline since the late 1970s. This paper shows that modern mechanized farming, the most dynamic of all agricultural sub-sectors, has the potential to raise savings, diversify income and generate increased food surplus. Farm size and capital are the major determinants of household income, which in turn determines households savings. Market-based pricing and foreign trade liberalization are imperative to encourage increased investment and food production in this sub-sector. The article, however, does not deal with important related issues such as income distribution and environmental concerns.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation and Income Distribution in Ethiopia
PY  - 2006
AB  - Irrigation stimulates agricultural productivity and economic growth, but this may come at the cost of growing inequality. Using data at community and household level, this paper analyzes the distributional impacts of irrigation in Ethiopia. Regression analyses reveal the direct effects of irrigation on expenditures and labour demand, and the indirect effects of irrigation on food prices and expenditures of non-irrigation households. The results indicate that past development of irrigation stimulated growth without deepening inequality, and that irrigation decreased dependence on food-for-work programs. Thus, irrigation has played a positive role in the development of Ethiopia.

TI  - The Acquisition and Diffusion of Knowledge: The Case of Pest Management Training in Farmer Field Schools, Indonesia
PY  - 2004
AB  - Farmer Field Schools (FFS) are an intensive training approach introduced in the last decade in many developing countries to promote knowledge and uptake of ecologically sensible production approaches, and in particular, integrated pest management which minimises pesticide use. Because of the high training cost, the viability of the program depends crucially on the effectiveness of knowledge diffusion from trained farmers to other farmers. This paper uses panel data from Indonesia to assess the extent of diffusion of knowledge regarding integrated pest management from trained farmers to other farmers. The results confirm that better knowledge leads indeed to reduced pesticide use, and that trained farmers make a modest gain in knowledge. However, there is no significant diffusion of knowledge to other farmers who reside in the same villages as the trained farmers. These results imply that revision in the training procedures and curriculum need to be considered if the FFS approach is to become viable and effective.

TI  - The social rate of return on infrastructure investments
PY  - 2000
AB  - The authors estimate social rates of return to electricity-generating capacity and paved roads, relative to the return on general capital, by examining the effect on aggregate output and comparing that effect with the costs of construction. They find that both types of infrastructure capital are highly complementary with other physical capital and human capital, but have rapidly diminishing returns if increased in isolation. The complementarities on the one hand, and diminishing returns on the other, point to the existence of an optimal mix of capital inputs, making it very easy for a country to have too much - or too little - infrastructure. For policy purposes, the authors compare the rate of return for investing in infrastructure with the estimated rate of return to capital. The strong complementarity between physical and human capital, and the lower prices of investment goods in industrial economies, means that the rate of return to capital as a whole is just as high in rich countries as in the poorest countries but is highest in the middle-income (per capita) countries. In most countries the rates of return to both electricity-generating capacity and paved roads are on a par with, or lower than, rates of return on other forms of capital. But in a few countries there is evidence of acute shortages of electricity-generating capacity and paved roads and, therefore, excess returns to infrastructure investment. Excess returns are evidence of suboptimal investment that, in the case of paved roads, appears to follow a period of sustained economic growth during which road-building stocks have lagged behind investments in other types of capital. This effect is accentuated by the fact that the relative costs of road construction are lower in middle-income countries than in poorer and richer countries. As a rule, a tendency to infrastructure shortages - signaled by higher social rates of return to paved roads or electricity-generating capacity than to other forms of capital - is symptomatic of certain income classes of developing countries: electricity capacity in the poorest, paved roads in the middle-income group. To the extent that such high rates of return are not detected by microeconomic cost-benefit analysis, they suggest macroeconomic externalities associated with infrastructure.

TI  - The impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security: The case of Filtino and Godino irrigation schemes in Ethiopia
PY  - 2008
AB  - Ethiopia’s irrigation potential is estimated at 3.7 million hectare, of which only about 190,000 ha (4.3% of the potential) is actually irrigated. There is little information on the extent to which the so far developed irrigation schemes have been effective in meeting their stated objectives of attaining food self-sufficiency and eradicating poverty. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security based on data obtained from 200 farmers in Ada Liben district of Ethiopia in 2006. The resulting data was analyzed using Heckman’s Two-step Estimation procedure. Studies elsewhere revealed that access to reliable irrigation water can enable farmers to adopt new technologies and intensify cultivation, leading to increased productivity, overall higher production, and greater returns from farming. Our study findings confirm some of these claims. In the study area about 70% of the irrigation users are food secure while only 20% of the non-users are found to be food secure. Access to small scale irrigation enabled the sample households to grow crops more than once a year; to insure increased and stable production, income and consumption; and improve their food security status. The study concludes that small-scale irrigation significantly contributed to household food security.

TI  - Are Returns to Investment Lower for the Poor? Human and Physical Capital Interactions in Rural Vietnam - Are Returns to Investment Lower for the Poor? Human and Physical Capital Interactions in Rural Vietnam
PY  - 2003
AB  - If the marginal gains from investment in physical capital depend positively on knowledge, but a household cannot hire skilled labor to compensate for low skills, then even if it has access to credit, the household will achieve lower returns than an educated household. If, as is common, the income-poor are less educated because of failures in the credit market, and because they live in areas where there is less access to schooling, then the poor will also have lower returns on investments. The author tests this argument for the case of irrigation infrastructure in Vietnam. She asks how a household's education level, and demographic characteristics influence the gains to household income from irrigating previously unirrigated land. The next marginal benefit of irrigation increases strongly with the education of a household. The results suggest that unless disparities in education are addressed, market-oriented reforms will generate inequitable agricultural growth in Vietnam.

PY  - 2005
AB  - The present paper examines socioeconomic changes and decline in rural poverty using a panel dataset collected in the Philippine villages in 1985, 1993 and 1997. The most important finding is the transition of the rural economy away from a regime of low nonfarm income to a regime of high nonfarm income accompanied by a marked decline in poverty. The relative contribution of access to land on rural poverty reduction declined, whereas the relative contribution of human capital, more importantly represented by college schooling, increased over time.

TI  - The role of education on the adoption of chemical fertiliser under different socioeconomic environments in Ethiopia
PY  - 2004
AB  - Studies on input adoption consider education as one of the most important factors that affect adoption decisions. However, very little is known about the spill-over effect of intra-household education on the adoption process and about the impact of education on adoption decisions under different socioeconomic conditions. We investigate these two issues using a discrete choice model. The results indicate that the decision making process is a decentralised one in which educated adult members of the household actively participate in the decision making process. This casts doubt on the traditional assumption that the household head is the sole decision maker. The results reveal that there is a substantial and statistically significant intra-household spill-over effect of education on the adoption decision of households. The results of the study also show that the coefficient of the education and the environment interaction variable is negative and statistically significant. This demonstrates that education and socioeconomic environments could be substitutes in modern environments and complementary in traditional ones. This implies that the expansion of education in traditional areas may be more attractive than in modern areas since education is usually the only means to enhance the ability of farmers to acquire, synthesise and respond to innovations such as chemical fertiliser.

TI  - Growth Options and Poverty Reduction in Ethiopia: A Spatial Economywide Model Analysis for 2004-15
PY  - NA
AB  - "This study assesses which agricultural subsectors have the strongest capacity to drive economic growth and poverty reduction in Ethiopia, and what kind of agricultural and nonagricultural growth is needed to achieve the millennium development goal of halving the 1990 poverty rate by 2015. A spatially disaggregated, economywide model was developed under the study, enabling the analysis of growth and poverty reduction linkages at national and regional levels using national household surveys, agricultural sample surveys, geographic information systems, and other national and regional data. The study reveals that agriculture has the potential to play a central role in decreasing poverty and increasing growth in Ethiopia, primarily through growth in staple crops and livestock. Agricultural growth also requires concurrent investments in roads and other market conditions. At the subnational level, similar rates of agricultural growth have different effects on poverty, necessitating regionally based strategies for growth and poverty reduction." Authors' Abstract

TI  - Diversification and Livelihood Sustainability in a Semi-arid Environment: A Case Study from Southern Ethiopia +
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract This paper examines the recently growing adoption of non-pastoral livelihood strategies among the Borana pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. A large portion of the current non-pastoral participation is in petty and natural resource-based activities. Pastoral and crop production functions are estimated using the Cobb-Douglas model to analyse the economic rationale behind the growing pastoralist shift to cultivation and other non-pastoral activities. The low marginal return to labour in traditional pastoralism suggests the existence of surplus labour that can gainfully be transferred to non-pastoral activities. An examination of the pastoralist activity choices reveals that the younger households with literacy and more exposure to the exchange system display a more diversified income portfolio preference. The findings underscore the importance of human capital investment and related support services for improving the pastoralist capacity to manage risk through welfare-enhancing diversified income po...

TI  - Consumption Vulnerability to Risk in Rural Pakistan
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract As one of the dimensions of vulnerability, this paper empirically investigates the inability of rural dwellers to cope with negative income shocks. A variable coefficient regression model is applied to a two-period household panel dataset collected in the North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan, an area with high incidence of income poverty and low human development. The empirical model allows for a different ability to smooth consumption, approximated by a linear function of households’ attributes, and controls for the endogeneity of observed changes in income, using qualitative information on subjective risk assessment. Estimation results show that the ability to cope with negative income shocks is lower for households that are aged, landless and do not receive remittances regularly.

TI  - Production Externalities of Education: Evidence from Rural Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Schooling has externality effects in agriculture when, in the course of conducting their own private economic activities, educated farmers raise the productivity of their uneducated neighbours. This paper seeks to determine the potential size and source of such benefits for rural areas of Ethiopia, where school enrolment is low and the private returns to education may not be apparent. Average and stochastic frontier production functions are estimated, including household and community education, as explanatory variables to measure the productivity and efficiency of farmers. In each case, internal and external returns to schooling are compared. We find substantial and significant externality benefits of education in increasing average production and shifting out the frontier. External benefits of schooling may be several times as high as internal benefits in this regard. However, we are unable to find evidence that technical efficiency is subject to externality effects. Our results suggest that adoption and diffusion of innovations that push out the frontier is the source of externalities to schooling. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

TI  - Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Development
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agricultural development is essential for economic growth, rural development, and poverty alleviation in low-income developing countries. Increasing agricultural productivity is an effective driver of economic growth and poverty reduction, both within and outside agricultural sectors. Increasing productivity requires good rural infrastructure, well-functioning domestic markets, appropriate institutions, and access to appropriate technology. Despite the well-documented importance of rural infrastructure to promote growth and reduce poverty, the high economic rates of return on investment in rural infrastructure, and significant deficiencies of rural infrastructure in most developing countries, neither national governments nor international aid agencies seem to prioritize investment in the construction of new infrastructure or in the maintenance of existing infrastructure. Failure to accelerate investment in rural infrastructure will make a mockery of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in poor developing countries and severely limit their ability to benefit from trade liberalization, international capital markets, and other potential gains from globalization.

TI  - Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Development in Southern Africa: a centre-periphery perspective
PY  - 1997
AB  - This paper discusses the provision of rural infrastructure in Southern Africa by drawing on two case studies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. It takes the centre-periphery model of regional development as a point of departure for explaining the differences between communal or smallholder African farming areas and large-scale commercial European farming areas in both countries. It observes that the imbalances noted in rural infrastructure provision between different regions are a function of colonial modes of production, agroecological endowments and levels of agricultural development. It finds strong similarities in these aspects between the two countries. The importance of developing peripheral agricultural areas, largely the domain of smallholder farmers, is discussed in the context of overall regional development. The policy implications of the centre-periphery perspective for infrastructure provision are presented. These include the need for both private and public sector investment, and comprehensive planning policies that are cognizant of the variations in the centre-periphery model as observed in the two countries.

TI  - Market access by smallholder farmers in Malawi: implications for technology adoption, agricultural productivity and crop income
PY  - 1998
AB  - Abstract In Malawi, maize is the major crop and food staple. Given limited off-farm employment opportunities, much-needed increases in household income for improving food security must come from gains in agricultural productivity through better technology and more profitable crops. In the past, hybrid maize and more recently, tobacco were promoted by policy for increasing smallholder income. An analysis of determinants of adoption of these two crops and related income effects is presented. Apart from factor endowment and exposure to agroecological risks, differences in the household's access to financial and commodity markets significantly influence its cropping shares and farm income.

TI  - Effect of a large dam on malaria risk: the Koka reservoir in Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary Objective To determine whether the Koka water reservoir in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia contributes to the malaria burden in its vicinity. Methods Frequency of malaria diagnosis in fever clinics was correlated with distance of residence from the margin of the Koka reservoir. Annual as well as seasonal malaria case rates were determined in cohorts residing < 3, 3–6 and 6–9 km from the reservoir. Plasmodium falciparum risk was compared with that of Plasmodium vivax. A multiple variable regression model was used to explore associations between malaria case rates and proximity to the reservoir, controlling for other suspected influences on malaria transmission. Results Malaria case rates among people living within 3 km of the reservoir are about 1.5 times as great as for those living between 3 and 6 km from the reservoir and 2.3 times as great for those living 6–9 km from the reservoir. Proximity to the reservoir is associated with greater malaria case rates in periods of more intense transmission. Plasmodium falciparum is most prevalent in communities located close to the reservoir and P. vivax in more distant villages. The presence of the reservoir, coupled with inter-annual climatic variations, explains more than half of the region's variability in malaria case rates. Conclusion Large water impoundments are likely to exacerbate malaria transmission in malaria-endemic parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Objectif Determiner si le reservoir d'eau de Koka dans le Rift Valley en Ethiopie contribue a la charge de morbidite de la malaria dans sa proximite. Methodes La frequence du diagnostic de cas de malaria dans les cliniques de fievre a ete correlee avec la distance de la residence a la berge du reservoir de Koka. Les taux annuels ainsi que saisonniers des cas de malaria ont ete determines dans des cohortes residant a moins de 3, entre 3 et 6 et entre 6 et 9 km du reservoir. Le risque de Plasmodium falciparum a ete comparea celui du P. vivax. Un modele de regression a multiples variables a ete utilise pour explorer les associations entre les taux de cas de malaria et la proximite au reservoir, controlant pour d'autres influences suspectees sur la transmission de malaria. Resultats Les taux de cas de malaria chez les personnes vivant a moins de 3 km du reservoir sont environ 1,5 fois plus eleves que chez ceux vivant entre 3 et 6 km du reservoir et 2,3 plus eleves que chez ceux vivant entre 6 et 9 km du reservoir. La proximite au reservoir est associee a de plus grands taux de cas de malaria dans les periodes de transmission plus intense. P. falciparum est le plus repandu dans les communautes situees pres du reservoir et P. vivax dans des villages plus eloignes. La presence du reservoir couplee aux variations climatiques interannuelles explique plus de la moitie de la variabilite des taux de cas de malaria dans la region. Conclusion Les grands reservoirs d'eau confinee sont susceptibles d'exacerber la transmission de la malaria dans les regions endemiques de l'Afrique subsaharienne. Objetivo Determinar si la reserva de agua de Koka, en el Rift Valley, Etiopia, contribuye a la carga por malaria en su vecindad. Metodos Se correlaciono la frecuencia del diagnostico de malaria en clinicas, con la distancia entre el lugar de residencia del paciente y los margenes de la reserva de Koka. Se determinaron las tasas anuales y estacionales de malaria en cohortes que viven a < 3, 3–6 y 6–9 km de la reserva. El riesgo de Plasmodium falciparum se comparo con el de P. vivax. Se utilizo un modelo de regresion multiple variable para explorar las asociaciones entre las tasas de casos de malaria y la proximidad a la reserva, controlando otros factores sospechosos de influir sobre la transmision de malaria. Resultados Las tasas de casos de malaria entre las personas que viven a 3 km de la reserva son mas o menos 1.5 veces mayores que aquellas para quienes viven entre 3 y 6 km de la reserva y 2.3 veces mayores que para aquellos que viven de 6 a 9 km de la reserva. La proximidad a la reserva esta asociada con mayores tasas de casos de malaria en periodos de mayor intensidad de transmision. P. falciparum es mas prevalente en comunidades que estan localizadas cerca de la reserve, mientras que P.vivax lo es en poblados distantes. La presencia del reservorio, junto con las variaciones climaticas interanuales, explica mas de la mitad de la variabilidad de las tasas de casos de malaria en la region. Conclusion Las grandes reservas de agua podrian exacerbar la transmision de malaria en lugares de Africa Sub-sahariana endemicos para malaria

TI  - INTENSIFICATION OF RAINFED LOWLAND RICE PRODUCTION IN WEST AFRICA: PRESENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL GREEN REVOLUTION
PY  - 2006
AB  - The objective of the current paper is to explore the factors influencing the expansion and intensification of rice production in rainfed lowland sites. The village/lowland-level data show the following: (1) the expansion of lowland rice cultivation has been driven by population pressure and accessibility to the market; and (2) the adoption of water control technologies is enhanced by the existence of immigrants and accessibility to the market. Rice cultivator data show that investment in water supply canals is influenced by land tenure security and that the canals enhance yield. This suggests that investment in water control technologies in rainfed lowland is necessary to realize a rice Green Revolution. Considering the fairly high average yield already achieved with water control technologies and the vast area of lowlands without water control technologies in rural area, there is a high potential of a rice Green Revolution in rainfed lowland in West Africa.

By applying the conditional nutrition demand approach to household data from three consecutive welfare monitoring surveys over the period 1996-1998, this study identifies household resources, parental education, food prices, and maternal nutritional knowledge as key determinants of growth faltering in Ethiopia. Income growth is important for alleviating child stunting, though on its own it will not suffice to reach the international goal of halving each country's level of child malnutrition by 2020. Universalizing access to primary schooling for girls has slightly more promise. However, to reduce child growth faltering in Ethiopia in a significant - and timely - manner, our empirical results indicate that targeted child growth monitoring and maternal nutrition education programs will be needed in conjunction with efforts to promote private income growth and formal schooling.

TI  - The impact of water management on poverty and the environment in the Upper Niger River Basin (Mali)
PY  - 2005
AB  - Water shortage is a severe problem for millions of people living along the southern fringe of the Sahara desert. Therefore, communities living in the semi-arid, western Sahel zone fully depend on rivers such as the Niger river. Mali is a classic case of a ‘river-dependent economy’ that is subject to enormous seasonal variation in rainfall and river flow. A popular solution to this climate dependency in the western Sahel zone has been the development of hydroelectric and hydro-agricultural irrigation schemes. Although Mali’s hydroelectric and hydro-agricultural potential has yet to be fully realised, it is widely questioned whether the costs and benefits of such mega-investments are properly estimated. Besides the economic feasibility (i.e. direct costs and benefits) of additional dams, it is still unclear what the indirect effects of hydroelectric and hydro-agricultural schemes are on downstream beneficiaries of rivers. These beneficiaries include fishermen, cattle breeders, shipping companies and farmers, as well as the biodiversity of the river and connected floodplains. The main objective of this study is to determine the role of dams and irrigation schemes in the overall economy and ecology of the Inner Niger Delta and the upstream region in Mali and Guinea. An integrated assessment has been conducted to determine the direct and indirect costs and benefits of different management regimes in the Niger river, starting with an analysis of potential changes to the hydrology, then subsequent ecological impacts and finally the social and economic effects. In estimating the costs and benefits associated with dams in the Niger River basin, various valuation techniques have been applied such as the production function approach and the contingent valuation method. All in all, this study shows that improving the performance of the existing infrastructure as well as the economic activities in the Inner Niger Delta itself, is a significantly more efficient way to increase economic growth, reduce poverty and protect the environment in the region than the building of a new dam and hydropower plant.

TI  - Linkages between productivity and equitable allocation of water
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract The rapid development of water resources in the Olifants river basin in South Africa, while stimulating economic growth, paid little attention to equity considerations among different users. Some 90% of the population of the basin was excluded from access to water when the present pattern of water allocations was developed. The recently enacted and very progressive water law aims at ensuring greater equity in access to water so that the benefits accruing from different water uses will be felt by a larger number of users. This paper examines the implications of water reallocations on water use and productivity at the basin level with a special focus on opportunities for revitalizing and expanding smallholder irrigation systems that are currently performing poorly and in many instances going out of production.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a regional water poverty index for Benin
PY  - NA
AB  - "The paper discusses the application of the Water Poverty Index (WPI) as a monitoring tool for Benin's water sector. Benin is currently in a process of political decentralization shifting responsibility for and administration of rural water supplies from the national to the communal level. Appropriate indicators are needed for monitoring and analyzing the progress of the water sector for each community. The Water Poverty Index allows monitoring of a combination of aspects affecting rural water management, including water sources, access to and use of water, human capacity to manage water, and environmental impacts. The application of this index is tested for Benin at the regional level. A series of variables have been chosen for inclusion into the index following data collection and analysis in Benin under the IMPETUS project. Results show a clear distinction between communes in the north and the south of the country and WPI rankings are similar to those for poverty levels. The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the WPI and suggests improvements for its application at the communal level." Author's Abstract

TI  - Water and the other three revolutions needed to end rural poverty.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Eight hundred million of the current 1.1 billion people who earn less than a dollar-a-day live in rural areas in developing countries. Since more than 550 million of them earn their living from agriculture, poverty eradication depends on increasing their income from farming. The millennium goals for hunger and poverty in the semi-arid tropics will not be met without four simultaneous revolutions. A revolution in water is needed to develop and mass disseminate a whole range of new affordable small plot irrigation technology. A revolution in agriculture is required to enable smallholders to produce a variety of high value marketable labor intensive cash crops. A revolution in markets is needed to open access to inputs and to profitable markets for their high value crops, incorporating effective strategies for aggregation, quality control, and decentralized added value processing. Finally, a revolution in design based on the ruthless pursuit of affordability is needed to support the other three revolutions. This paper describes the rapidly growing micro-irrigation revolution exemplified by the $250 million in new net annual income now being earned by Treadle Pump farmers, and outlines the key features of the other three revolutions required to meet millennium poverty goals.

TI  - Does irrigation water matter for rural poverty alleviation? Evidence from South and South-East Asia
PY  - 2003
AB  - This paper addresses four key questions. What are the irrigation–poverty inequality linkages? Does access to irrigation water matter for rural poverty alleviation? Under what conditions does irrigation have the greatest impact on poverty? What are the pro-poor interventions that can enhance the antipoverty impact of irrigation? Findings from IWMI-led studies and other empirical studies show that: (1) irrigation enables households to improve crop productivity, grow high-valued crops, generate higher incomes and employment, earn a higher implicit wage rate for family labor and, more importantly, benefits the poor and landless through the enhanced availability of food, lower food prices, higher employment and income and other indirect effects; (2) access to irrigation water reduces the incidence and severity of poverty; (3) irrigation's impact on poverty is highest where landholdings are equitably distributed; (4) effective rural poverty alleviation requires that irrigation development be targeted to poor communities; and (5) unequal land distribution is associated with inequitable distribution of agricultural water benefits. We argue that the antipoverty impact of irrigation water can, therefore, be intensified through triggering a set of board and targeted interventions, simultaneously.

TI  - Managing the externalities of declining dry season river flow: A case study from the Ewaso Ngiro North River Basin, Kenya
PY  - 2004
AB  - [1] Upstream-downstream water conflicts are common phenomenon in most basins. Such conflicts take a different dimension when they occur during dry season with an already low level of river flows. This context aggravates the spatial externalities on downstream communities and water-dependent ecosystems, causing serious socioeconomic and ecological effects. Utilizing an analytical framework to capture the causes and consequences of the spatial nature of these externalities and relying on both primary and secondary data pertaining to the Upper Ewaso Ngiro North basin in Kenya, this paper (1) shows how these externalities are caused more by upstream land and water use changes than by any climatic and hydrological factors, (2) evaluates the nature and magnitude of their impacts on different downstream community groups, (3) assesses the extent and success of past policy responses and local initiatives, and (4) concludes by indicating the needed approach and interventions for finding a durable solution to the problem of upstream-downstream water conflicts and externalities.

TI  - Farm water and rural poverty reduction in developing Asia
PY  - 2007
AB  - The study on “pro-poor intervention strategies in irrigated agriculture in Asia” by Hussain 2005 shows that, in 26 major and medium-size canal irrigation schemes in Asia, irrigated areas average 20% lower poverty than adjacent rainfed areas; gains are more with pro-poor management of water for farming (PPMWF) and where distribution of farmland or farm water is more equal. These findings, and the measured endorsement of participatory irrigation management (PIM) of these schemes, look robust, though they need to allow for externalities (interaction with groundwater and micro-irrigation; out-of-scheme downstream effects). This paper explores some implications. The diagnosed “inefficiency of gross inequality” in irrigation echoes similar wider-scale findings on aggregate inequality and vulnerability. The choice among irrigation techniques, and science to develop new ones, need to adapt more to the needs of PPMWF. PPMWF planning must itself adapt – as must design of new schemes – to the needs for sustainable water resources, manageable health impacts, and proper treatment of displaced people. Technical and management design to reduce irrigation corruption – as it relates to poverty impact of irrigation, and to PIM – needs more review. The causal links from various types of irrigation to growth, distribution and poverty need more extensive modelling and testing. The important implications of this study (with the above contexts) for major irrigation in Africa – almost certainly essential for major progress against poverty there – need systematic assessment. Finally, some open issues are listed. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. L'etude de « strategies d'intervention en faveur des plus pauvres dans l'agriculture irriguee en Asie » par Hussain 2005 montre que, dans 26 grands et moyens systemes d'irrigation en Asie, les secteurs irrigues ont une pauvrete moyenne inferieure de 20% a celle des zones voisines non irriguees; les gains sont plus eleves avec une gestion « pro-pauvres » de l'eau agricole (GPPEA), et la ou la repartition de la terre ou de l'eau est plus egalitaire. Ces resultats, et l'adoption mesuree de la gestion participative de l'irrigation (GPI) dans ces perimetres, semblent robustes, bien qu'ils ne prennent pas en compte les externalites (interaction avec les eaux souterraines et la micro-irrigation; effets hors perimetres en aval). Cet article explore quelques unes des implications de ces resultats. Le diagnostic « d'inefficacite de l'inegalite » en irrigation fait echo a ce que l'on constate a plus grande echelle sur l'inegalite et la vulnerabilite globales. Le choix et la base scientifique renouvelee des techniques d'irrigation doivent davantage s'adapter aux besoins de la GPPEA. Et celle-ci doit elle-meme tenir le plus grand compte – comme le doit aussi la conception de nouveaux perimetres – du besoin en ressources en eau durables, des impacts sur la sante, et du traitement approprie des personnes deplacees. La conception technique et operationnelle des nouveaux perimetres irrigues en vue de reduire la corruption dans l'irrigation – dans ses interactions avec la pauvrete et la GPI – demande plus d'attention. Les consequences des divers types d'irrigation sur la croissance, la repartition et la pauvrete doivent faire davantage l'objet de modelisation. Les importantes implications de cette etude (dans les contextes indiques ci-dessus) pour la grande irrigation en Afrique – certainement aussi essentielle pour la lutte contre la pauvrete la-bas – ont besoin d'evaluation systematique. En conclusion, un certain nombre de questions sont enumerees. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Hydrology of malaria: Model development and application to a Sahelian village
PY  - 2008
AB  - [1] We present a coupled hydrology and entomology model for the mechanistic simulation of local-scale response of malaria transmission to hydrological and climatological determinants in semiarid, desert fringe environments. The model is applied to the Sahel village of Banizoumbou, Niger, to predict interannual variability in malaria vector mosquito populations that lead to variations in malaria transmission. Using a highresolution, small-scale distributed hydrology model that incorporates remotely sensed data for land cover and topography, we simulate the formation and persistence of the pools constituting the primary breeding habitat of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes, the principal regional malaria vector mosquitoes. An agent-based mosquito population model is coupled to the distributed hydrology model, with aquatic-stage and adult-stage components. Through a dependence of aquatic-stage mosquito development and adult emergence on pool persistence, we model small-scale hydrology as a dominant control of mosquito abundance. For each individual adult mosquito, the model tracks attributes relevant to population dynamics and malaria transmission, which are updated as mosquitoes interact with their environment, humans, and animals. Weekly field observations were made in 2005 and 2006. A 16% increase in rainfall between the two years was accompanied by a 132% increase in mosquito abundance between 2005 and 2006. The model reproduces mosquito population variability at seasonal and interannual timescales and highlights individual pool persistence as a dominant control. Future developments of the presented model can be used in the evaluation of impacts of climate change on malaria, as well as the a priori evaluation of environmental management-based interventions.

TI  - TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND COMMERCIALIZATION IN AGRICULTURE: The Effect on the Poor
PY  - 1991
AB  - Do the economic gains brought by technological innovation and commercialization in agriculture work their way through to the poor? The prevailing optimistic view is that they do. But this view is not universal: some hold that these forces for change can interact with, or even induce, institutional and market failure, with adverse consequences for the poor. Adherents of the pessimistic view point to real-world instances in which the poor have failed to reap the benefits, or even have lost, from the technological change or commercialization. Where these effects have occurred we find that they are mostly attributable to inelastic demand or adverse institutional features; often, when technology or commercialization has been blamed for the decline in income of the poor, other-not necessarily connected-policies have in fact been responsible for the damage. This article contends that the optimistic view is, by and large, correct: normally, technology and commercialization stimulate agricultural growth, improve employment opportunities, and expand food supply-all central to the alleviation of poverty. The evidence does not offer much encouragement to an extension of this view-that through "social engineering" the benefits from technology and commercialization can easily be targeted toward the poor; the limited opportunities for such targeting should of course be seized.

TI  - EFFECT OF IRRIGATION AND LARGE DAMS ON THE BURDEN OF MALARIA ON A GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SCALE
PY  - 2005
AB  - Human-made ecologic transformations have occurred at an unprecedented rate over the past 50 years. Prominent among them are water resource development projects. An estimated 40,000 large dams and 800,000 small dams have been built, and 272 million hectares of land are currently under irrigation worldwide. The establishment and operation of water projects has had a history of facilitating a change in the frequency and transmission dynamics of malaria, but analyses of these environmental risk factors are sparse. Here, we present a comprehensive review of studies that assessed the impact of irrigation and dam building on malaria prevalence or incidence, stratified by the World Health Organization's (WHO) sub-regions of the world, and link these studies with the latest statistics on disability adjusted life years, irrigated agriculture, and large dams. We also present estimates of the population at risk due to proximity to irrigation schemes and large dam reservoirs. In WHO sub-regions 1 and 2, which have 87.9% of the current global malaria burden, only 9.4 million people are estimated to live near large dams and irrigation schemes. In contrast, the remaining sub-regions concentrate an estimated 15.3 million people near large dams and up to 845 million near irrigation sites, while here only 12.1% of the global malaria burden is concentrated. Whether an individual water project triggers an increase in malaria transmission depends on the contextual determinants of malaria, including the epidemiologic setting, socioeconomic factors, vector management, and health seeking behavior. We conclude that in unstable malaria endemic areas, integrated malaria control measures, coupled with sound water management, are mandatory to mitigate the current burden of malaria in locations near irrigation or dam sites.

TI  - Infrastructure and Poverty Reduction
PY  - 2010
AB  - The paper investigates the impact of infrastructural development on poverty reduction in Nigeria. Specifically, the relative effects of physical and social infrastructure on living standards or poverty indicators are examined, with a view to providing empirical evidence on the implications of increased urban infrastructure for the urban poor. The paper employs secondary data for the period 1970:1 to 2005:4 and the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) technique is adopted in the analysis. The study unequivocally finds that infrastructural development leads to poverty reduction. Results also show that though infrastructure in general reduces poverty, social infrastructure explains a higher proportion of the forecast error in poverty indicators relative to physical infrastructure. This suggests that massive investment in social infrastructure in cities would drastically reduce poverty in the urban areas.

TI  - World development report 2008 : agriculture for development
PY  - 2007
AB  - Agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goal that calls for halving by 2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger. That is the overall message of this year's World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas, and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing and implementing agriculture for development agendas that can make a difference in the lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor. The report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farmers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this report identifies many emerging successes that can be scaled up. In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban income disparities. Asia's fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor intensive, high value agriculture linked to a dynamic rural, non-farm sector. In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources. With the right incentives and investments, agriculture's environmental footprint can be lightened and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity.

TI  - Escaping poverty and becoming poor in 36 villages of Central and Western Uganda
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Twenty-four per cent of households in 36 village communities of Central and Western Uganda have escaped from poverty over the past 25 years, but another 15 per cent have simultaneously fallen into poverty. A roughly equal number of households escaped from poverty in the first period (ten to 25 years ago) as in the second period (the last ten years) examined here. However, almost twice as many households fell into poverty during the second period as in the first period. Progress in poverty reduction has slowed down as a result. Multiple causes are associated with descent into poverty and these causes vary significantly between villages in the two different regions. For nearly two-thirds of all households in both regions, however, ill health and health-related costs were a principal reason for descent into poverty. Escaping poverty is also associated with diverse causes, which vary across the two regions. Compared to increases in urban employment, however, land-related reasons have been more import...

TI  - Can development of water resources reduce poverty
PY  - 2003
AB  - The United Nations Millennium Declaration and resolutions at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development give high priority to poverty reduction in international development agenda for the next decade and a half. It is now widely recognized that water resources development and management play a fundamental role in sustainable growth and poverty reduction. However, investments in water resources development, which were considered a high priority by governments and aid agencies for decades, have fallen drastically. The key question addressed in this paper is: Can water resources development reduce poverty? It examines the impacts of past investments on water resources development and management, (especially on irrigation), on poverty reduction. It is shown that past investments in irrigation development have made a significant contribution to alleviating poverty. In recent years investments made by private farmers in groundwater irrigation may have had a larger impact on livelihoods for poor people than the public investments in large-scale surface water irrigation systems. It is argued that there is not a single silver bullet to reduce poverty though water resources development or management. The best chance for lasting and sustainable impact on poverty is likely to be achieved through a combination of sustainable water resources development, combined with the development of appropriate pro-poor institutions and technologies.

TI  - DIFFUSION AND ADOPTION OF NERICA RICE VARIETIES IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
PY  - 2006
AB  - Because of their promises to combine the high yielding quality of the Asian rice with the local adaptability of the African rice, the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) rice varieties, which have won its creator Monty Jones the 2004 World Food Prize, are raising hopes for increased rice productivity in Africa. We use data from a sample of 1,500 farmers to consistently estimate the NERICA actual and potential adoption rates and determinants in Cote d’Ivoire. The NERICA actual adoption rate in 2000 is estimated to be 4%, although its potential adoption rate is estimated at 27%. The estimated 23% population “adoption gap” (difference between the 27% potential adoption rate and the 4% actual adoption rate) in 2000, which is because of solely to the limited diffusion of the NERICA in the population in 2000, suggests a large potential adoption impact that could be realized by a successful NERICA dissemination project.

TI  - Determinants of Function and Dysfunction in Irrigation Performance, and Implications for Performance Improvement
PY  - 1995
AB  - This paper suggests definitions of three elem ents essential to successful irrigation- w ater rights, infrastructure capable of delivering the service im plied in the w ater right, and assigned operational responsibilities. D epending on w hether the basic elem ents are properly m atched, system s are defined as 'functional' or 'dysfunctional'. The im portance of interactions among these factors is illustrated through field exam ples. It is argued that perform ance analysis of dysfunctional system s is problem atic, and functionality may be a prerequisite to significant im provem ents in perform ance. The definition of water rights, particularly as undocumented and unregulated usage develops, is likely to present the most difficult challenge to achieving functionality.

TI  - A comparative analysis of rainfed and irrigated agricultural production in Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Ethiopia’s economy is dependent on agriculture which contributes more than 50% to GDP, about 60% to foreign exchange earning and provides livelihood to more than 85% of the population. Ethiopia has a large potential of water resources that could be developed for irrigation. Despite the large water resources, Ethiopia continues to receive food aid to about 10% of the population who are at risk annually, out of a total of more than 67 million. The government of Ethiopia is committed to solving this paradox through an agricultural led development program that includes irrigation development as one of the strategies. This paper compares rainfed and irrigated agricultural production in Ethiopia. Using the stochastic production frontier approach, the study concludes that irrigation development in Ethiopia is a viable development strategy but attention needs to be paid to improving the technology available to farmers under both rainfed and irrigated production.

TI  - Does human capital raise farm or nonfarm earning more? New insight from a rural Pakistan household panel
PY  - 2007
AB  - This study explores how human capital affects farm household earnings using two tools to refine measurement of human capital effects. First, it employs a two-sector model to allow the allocation of family labor between farm and nonfarm activities. Second, it accounts for village fixed effects to evaluate whether results from panel data differ meaningfully from a cross-sectional data analysis with local binary variables. The results show that education has a negligible effect on farm earnings; instead, experience appears to be the principal channel by which human capital affects agricultural performance in a traditional rural setting. Our results also suggest that prior models that fail to separate nonfarm activities spuriously exaggerated the effect of education to the farm sector. In addition, typical cross-sectional analyses that ignore fixed effects may cause the effects of education on rural household earnings to be significantly overstated. The fact that panel data regressions accounting for village-level fixed effects found only one instance of education raising earnings—the effect of literacy on nonfarm income—suggests that considerable heterogeneity may have been ignored in cross-sectional data analyses, especially ones that omitted village-level effects.

TI  - An analysis of the water management performance of small holder irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe
PY  - 1998
AB  - This paper analyses the water management performance of small holder irrigation systems in Zimbabwe. The government and farmer managed systems are compared in terms of their ability to match desired with actual water supply. Desired supply is defined as crop water requirements adjusted downwards by rainfall where relevant. The Theil measure of accuracy of forecasts is used to calculate the error committed by each system in trying to match water supply and demand. The analysis shows that, everything else being equal, the farmer managed system performs better than the government system in matching supply and demand. This means that the farmer managed systems should be encouraged for future small holder irrigation development in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Unequal wealth accumulation and income inequality in a unimodal agriculture: Sudan's Radad irrigation scheme
PY  - 1989
AB  - Patterns of income, savings, and wealth accumulation of tenant farmers in the Rahad irrigation scheme of Sudan were examined. Although land and irrigation water are publicly owned and equally distributed in these schemes, unequal access to capital was found to influence strongly the distribution of family income and the saving and accumulation capacities of the tenant farmers. Analysis using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients revealed a high positive correlation between wealth and family income. The average wealth gap between poor and rich households increased by 28 per cent over the year of the study. To reduce relative poverty, improved credit and marketing systems plus more research and extension support to enhance productivity and create higher on‐farm incomes for the poorer tenants are needed. In addition, macro and sector policies that subsidise labour‐saving technologies and lower incentives for export and domestic crop production need to be reformed to promote greater employment and higher off‐fa...

TI  - LINKAGES BETWEEN POVERTY AND LAND MANAGEMENT IN RURAL UGANDA: EVIDENCE FROM THE UGANDA NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, 1999/00
PY  - NA
AB  - "This study investigates the impacts of rural poverty on farmers' land management decisions, crop production and incomes, based upon analysis of data from the 1999/2000 Uganda National Household Survey. We find that the impacts of rural poverty on land management, crop production and income depend upon the type of poverty (i.e., what asset or access factor is constrained) and the type of land management considered...Our results suggest that improvement in smallholders' access to land, other assets, education, extension, market information, credit, roads, and off-farm opportunities can help to break the downward cycle of poverty and land degradation, and put farmers on a more sustainable development pathway. Access to land (area and quality), other assets, education and off-farm opportunities appear to be particularly important in addressing poverty directly, while other interventions are likely to have more indirect impacts, as they influence land management, crop choice, and other livelihood decisions. Given the importance of land as the major asset owned by poor rural households in Uganda, investing in land quality maintenance and improvement is a critical need. However, we found low marginal returns to investments in organic or inorganic fertilizer and other land management practices, suggesting that it will be difficult to get farmers to make such investments in the present environment. Improvements in the market environment as well as development of more profitable land management technologies appears essential to address this need." from Authors' Abstract

TI  - Integrated watershed management: A planning methodology for construction of new dams in Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Integrated watershed management (IWM) is emerging as an alternative to the centrally planned and sectoral approaches that currently characterize the planning process for dam construction in Ethiopia. This report clarifies the concept of IWM, and reviews the major social, environmental and economic problems caused by dams in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Dams are planned from a top-down perspective in Ethiopia, some people are relocated against their will, haphazard land-use changes can occur, and soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation can increase. Many communities affected by dam constructions have not been sufficiently recognized or compensated, and environmental protection measures such as land-use planning and soil and water conservation have not been adopted in watersheds in which construction of dams is occurring. Furthermore, revenues generated from hydropower and water supplies often benefit urban dwellers, or the national economy, at the expense of rural inhabitants in watersheds. Creation of a multistakeholder platform, integration of soft system methodology with hard system tools, and completion of environmental protection measures should be among the major components of an improved planning methodology for construction of new dams in Ethiopia. This translates into an environment wherein science and knowledge can help watershed inhabitants create a diversity of locally appropriate resource management solutions. Effective implementation of environmental policies and strategies could improve the quality of watershed-based developments. The conclusion is that the IWM approach is a good alternative to effectively address the social, environmental and economic problems associated with planning and constructing new dams in Ethiopia.

TI  - Cutting World Hunger in Half
PY  - 2005
AB  - To reach the Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015, the Millennium Project9s Task Force on Hunger recommends seven mutually reinforcing actions: political action; national policy reforms; increased agricultural productivity for food-insecure farmers; improved nutrition for the chronically hungry; productive safety nets for the acutely hungry; improved rural incomes and markets; and restored natural resources essential for food security. The Task Force concludes that "it can be done"-the Hunger MDG can be attained. In this Policy Forum, the task force chairmen explain why achieving that goal will require unprecedented levels of effort, but it is well within the reach of our technical and financial capabilities.

TI  - Livelihoods, Growth, and Links to Market Towns in 15 Ethiopian Villages
PY  - NA
AB  - Rural and urban spaces are usually regarded as "separate" in both development theory and practice. Yet there are myriad links between them. Urban areas, including regional urban centers such as local market towns, provide households with new opportunities to sell goods and services. These opportunities increase household income by employing previously unemployed household resources or because households reallocate household resources so as to take advantage of new, more profitable activities. Links to market towns improve the prices received by rural households because households can benefit from increased demand for their goods or because the larger market is better able to absorb production from rural areas without causing prices to decline. These links allow households access to a wider variety of productive inputs and services, to better quality inputs or to inputs that are available on a timely basis. Benefits in terms of price, variety, and quality also apply to the purchase of goods for consumption. Despite the many potential benefits, the importance of local and regional urban centers (towns and small- and medium-size cities, as opposed to large cities and metropolitan areas) to rural livelihoods remains largely under-researched. Knowing more about the nature of links of rural households to market towns is important for guiding regional development policies and poverty-reduction strategies. This paper uses longitudinal data from 15 villages in rural Ethiopia to explore the nature and consequences of these links. It addresses the following questions: (1) What are the links between rural households and local urban centers? (2) Does better access to local market towns affect household economic behavior? and (3) Does better access to local market towns make households better off? Three core findings emerge. First, rural households undertake a significant proportion of their economic transactions in local market towns. These localities are the site for about half the purchases of inputs used in agricultural production, from a quarter to three-quarters of sales of crops and livestock. They are the primary location of the sale of artisanal products, particularly by women. More than half of household purchases of consumables and various types of foods occur in these market towns. Strikingly, these are, largely, the only urban localities in which these rural households undertake economic activities. Apart from remittances, there are few direct links with more distant urban centers or the capital city. Second, access to market towns affects economic activity in rural areas. The more remote they are from these towns, the less likely households are to purchase inputs or sell a variety of products. Third, improved access to market towns has positive effects on welfare. Improving the presence of roads and their quality and improved transport increases consumption outcomes: the effects are substantial and strongly significant. Furthermore, communities with better roads have persistently higher growth rates than others. More remote communities in terms of distance to town have a (relatively weak) tendency to grow slower, beyond any of the effects related to infrastructure. Development debates are predicated on the separateness of urban and rural spaces. But while one should be cautious in overinterpreting the results from this study, given the relatively small number of localities, the results suggest that local market towns and cities play a key role in providing space for the economic activities of rural households. Their role in connecting urban and rural areas suggests that drawing too strong a divide between rural and urban localities, and envisioning that economic activities are confined to respective urban and rural areas, are misleading. Rather than seeing the urban and rural sectors as being distinct, a more fruitful approach is to see them as a continuum, running from the capital city, to larger regional centers, to smaller market towns, to the rural spaces in which our respondents live. The extent to which a strategy focusing more on urban or rural localities will ?spill over? onto the other will depend on how closely they are tied together. In our results, market towns and cities are an important source of demand for products produced in rural areas, and rural residents are a source of demand for goods sold in urban areas. Improving the presence of roads, their quality, and improved transport are important factors that will further bind these spaces together and improve rural welfare.

TI  - Agriculture on the road to industrialization.
PY  - 1995
AB  - In Agriculture on the Road to Industrialisation, John Mellor brings together a distinguished group of contributors to examine the lessons drawn from those less developed countries whose success in agricultural development allowed for successful overall economic development. The framework for discussion includes three components: increased productivity resulting from technological change in the agricultural sector; the use of increased agricultural income; and consequent expansion of other sectors of the economy. The volume includes nine case studies. Thailand and Argentina serve as examples of successes due to the expansion in land area given over to agriculture, while Taiwan, Punjab (India), and the Philippines represent contrasting cases because they indicate little agricultural growth through expansion. Kenya, Costa Pica, and Colombia show how acceleration results from the changed composition of production and resulting growth in agricultural exports. Volume editor John Mellor provides an introduction and conclusion drawing out what can be learned from these cases.

TI  - Returns to investment in education: A global update
PY  - 1994
AB  - The author updates compilations of rate of return estimates to investment in education published since 1985 - and discusses methodological issues surrounding those estimates. Some key patterns: among the three main levels of education, primary education continues to exhibit the highest social profitability in all world regions - private returns are considerably higher than social returns because of the public subsidization of education; the degree of public subsidy increases with the level of education, which is regressive; social and private returns at all levels generally decline by the level of a country's per capita income; overall, the returns to female education are higher than those to male education, but at individual levels of education the pattern is more mixed; the returns to the academic secondary school track are higher than the vocational track - since unit cost of vocational education is much higher; and the returns for those who work in the private (competitive) sector of the economy are higher than in the public (noncompetitive) sector. And the returns in the self-employment (unregulated) sector of the economy are higher than in the dependent employment sector. Controversies in the literature are discussed in the light of the new evidence. The undisputable and universal positive correlation between education and earnings can be interpreted in many ways. The causation issue on whether education really affects earnings can be answered only with experimental data generated by randomly exposing different people to various amounts of education. Given the fact that moral and pragmatic considerations prevent the generation of such pure data, researchers have to make do with indirect inferences or natural experiments. Some have been attempted. The author looks at the research on overeducation or surplus schooling. The conclusions reinforce earlier patterns. They confirm that primary education continues to be the number one investment priority in developing countries. They also show that educating females is marginally more profitable than educating males, that the academic secondary school curriculum is a better investment than the technical/vocational tract, and that the returns to education obey the same rules as investment in conventional capital - that is, they decline as investment is expanded.

TI  - Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Output Linkages: A Study of 256 Indian Districts
PY  - 2006
AB  - The linkages between infrastructure development and sustained output growth have been documented by many global empirical studies (Aschauer, 1989; Canning, 1998; Calderon and Chong, 2004) and worldwide reviews (Sawada, 2000; ADB et al., 2005; Estache et al., 2005; Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa, 2006). Crosscountry analyses have also documented strong linkages between infrastructure and agricultural output growth. For example, using cross-sectional data for 47 less developed countries including India, Antle (1983) found a strong and positive relationship between infrastructure development and aggregate agricultural productivity. Using annual data for 58 countries Binswanger et al., (1987) reported a positive and significant correlation between road development and aggregate crop output. These views have been substantiated by many Asian studies (Ruttan, 2002; Mundlak et al., 2004). Studies from Indian settings also document evidence of positive linkages between various types of infrastructure and agricultural output growth (Antle, 1984). Rural infrastructure (both physical and institutional) such as irrigation, watershed development, rural electrification, roads, markets, credit institutions, rural literacy, agricultural research and extension, etc., together play a key role in determining the agricultural output in India. For instance, irrigation infrastructure increases the land use intensity and cropping intensity, and provides incentives to farmers to use yield increasing inputs, and thus results in higher agricultural output (Dhawan, 1988; Shah, 1993; Vaidyanathan, 1999; Narayanamoorthy and Deshpande, 2005). Rural electrification increases the energisation of pumpsets, which helps to increase the

TI  - The impact of the National Fadama Facility in alleviating rural poverty and enhancing agricultural development in South-Western Nigeria.
PY  - 2004
AB  - KEYWORDS Lowland irrigation; rural poverty; agriculture; development ABSTRACT This study assessed the potential of the National Fadama (lowland irrigation) facility to enhance smallholder farmers production and income thereby lifting them out of the vicious circle of poverty in South Western Nigeria. About 5% of the participants in Osun State were randomly selected and their performance compared with that of the baseline study conducted before the facility took off. Furthermore, the stochastic frontier production function model was utilized to estimate the technical efficiency level of the participants. Results obtained shows that the farm income obtained from Fadama cultivation increased about three times from #13368.00 at baseline to #38918.00 in the current season. The stochastic production function results obtained shows the coefficients of age of farmer result number of children and farming experience being significant at 1% while the coefficient of cost of seed was significant at 10% level. The range at technical efficiency obtained was 0.9959-0.9964 suggesting a relatively efficient level of production by the participants. The programme thus has a potential to alleviate the participants from poverty.

TI  - Rates of Return to Education: Does the Conventional Pattern Prevail in Sub-Saharan Africa?
PY  - 1994
AB  - Abstract In his most recent review of rates of return to education (RORE), Psacharopoulos reaffirms that the conventional pattern of continent-wide aggregate social and private ROREs continues to prevail among both developed and developing countries. In particular, “primary education continues to exhibit the highest social profitability in the world regions” (Psacharopoulos, 1994). A detailed examination of individual RORE studies undertaken in sub-Saharan African countries reveals, however, pervasive theoretical and empirical shortcomings which seriously undermine the credibility of aggregate RORE estimates for the continent as a whole.

TI  - Irrigation systems as multiple-use commons: Water use in Kirindi Oya, Sri Lanka
PY  - 1999
AB  - Irrigation systems are recognized as common pool resources supplying water for agricultural production, but their role in supplying water for other uses is often overlooked. The importance of non-agricultural uses of irrigation water in livelihood strategies has implications for irrigation management and water rights, especially as increasing scarcity challenges existing water allocation mechanisms. This paper examines the multiple uses of water in the Kirindi Oya irrigation system in Sri Lanka, who the users are, and implications for water rights and management policies. There are important residential, gender, and class differences among the water users. People use irrigation system water not only for field crops, but also for fishing, homestead gardens, and livestock. Even within irrigated farming households, men have more control over paddy crops in the main fields, whereas homestead gardens are women's domain. Because the irrigation system provides water for birds and animals, even wildlife and non-resident environmental groups can be considered stakeholders. Current policies emphasize user involvement in both irrigation and domestic water supply. While government agencies have had primary responsibility, institutions such as Farmers' Organizations are being promoted. These have the potential to serve as user platforms for negotiating water allocation among irrigated farmers. However, the user organizations reflect the sectoral responsibility of the government agencies. Their membership and structure do not take into account the multiple uses or users of water. Developing platforms that accommodate different user groups remains a major challenge for improving the overall productivity, as well as equity, of water use.

TI  - Adoption decision and use intensity of soil and water conservation measures by smallholder subsistence farmers in Dedo District, Western Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soil degradation in the highlands of Ethiopia is a serious problem that threatens the sustainability of agriculture. Although efforts have been made to develop and promote several soil conservation technologies, their adoption has not been widespread. This study, based on responses from a sample of 101 households which operate on 204 plots in Western Ethiopia, interviewed in 2003 cropping year, employed a Tobit model to identify the main factors influencing farmers' decision to adopt and intensify the use of improved and indigenous soil and water conservation (SWC) measures. The results suggest that area of cultivated land, land/labour ratio, age and education level of household head and distance of the plot from home and slope of the plot provided statistically adequate predictive power on the use and intensity of SWC measures. These results are discussed and their implications for conservation programs are presented in the conclusion. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PY  - 1991
AB  - A high rate of growth for the agriculture sector is desirable for India for many reasons. Though the percent age of labour force engaged in agriculture has come down in recent years, still 65% of it depends on agriculture. Large part of the population in poverty also depends on agriculture. A fast growing agriculture can indeed help reduce rural poverty. And a high growth rate of agriculture and consequent increase in rural employment, both agricultural and non-agricultural, can reduce the rate of rural/urban migration. This in turn helps reduce the stress on urban facilities and environment.

TI  - The effects of irrigation on poverty: a framework for analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

TI  - Poverty Traps and Human Capital Accumulation
PY  - 2001
AB  - In this paper I show that persistent inequality in the distribution of human capital and a negative relation between initial inequality and steady-state aggregate output may follow from the fact that the poor require relatively higher returns to increase expenditure on education. Moreover, I show that poverty traps emerging in models where individual transitions do not depend on aggregate dynamics, though not robust to the introduction of idiosyncratic uncertainty, may still be relevant observationally, if idiosyncratic shocks occur with low probability. In this context, I also analyse the implications of introducing a public education system.

TI  - Dynamics of poverty, livelihoods and property rights in the Lower Nyando Basin of Kenya
PY  - 2005
AB  - Data from 14 villages representing contrasting circumstances around the Lower Nyando basin in Kenya indicate that the incidence of poverty is higher in the flood plain than in the other parts of the basin. Over the last ten years, poverty has risen significantly in an area controlled by the National Irrigation Board (NIB), increased slowly in smallholder mixed farming areas, and remained relatively stable in areas supported by the Provincial Irrigation Unit (PIU). Reasons for these trends are discussed, and are linked to factors including land tenure and forms of external support. Customary gender biases against women are also exacerbated in the irrigation schemes. As it plans a revitalization of the irrigation sector under the new Water Act of 2002, the government should consider organizational arrangements that will provide women and men farmers with suitable services without compromising their discretion over land and water use.

TI  - The African green revolution as a pro‐poor policy instrument
PY  - 2002
AB  - In opposition to a number of the presentations at the Conference, we argue that the development of foodcrop agriculture needs to be considered as a pivotal poverty reduction strategy in Africa—in spite of the sector's erratic performance which has seen a number of ‘mini-green revolutions’ take off, falter and crash back to earth. We insist that for at least five reasons—the scale-neutrality of hybrid seed technology, its labour-intensity, its tendency to reduce risks, its ability to reduce the prices of poor people's basic foods and its ability to stimulate off-farm linkages—the hybrid seed revolution, partial though it has been, needs to be supported and sustained, and not dismissed as fated to fail in African conditions. We support this conclusion by two estimates of poverty impact of these ‘new’ technologies—a quick and dirty estimate based on four channels of impact only (income of adopter households, labour market, consumer prices and off-farm linkages) and an estimate derived from a multi-market model of Uganda, in which about one-tenth of the poverty reduction achieved in Uganda since 1992 is ascribed to productivity change in maize and cassava. We note that a number of domestic and aid policy factors—from weak rural infrastructure and financial systems to food aid—have tended to reduce either the incentive to introduce new technologies, and/or the poverty-elasticity of their introduction. To reduce many of the different poverties from which Africa suffers, we argue, the policies responsible for the underdevelopment of its cereal crops need coordinated reform across many countries; in preparing such reform, inspiration can be taken from the policies which preceded the surge in agricultural productivity in India, Indonesia and China 30 years ago.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on rural poverty in India: An aggregate panel-data analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - The main objective of this study is to quantify the marginal impacts of irrigation and selected input factors on spatial (across 14 states) and temporal (from 1970–1993) variation in the rural poverty level in India. The study uses the head count ratio measure (percent of population below the poverty line) of poverty to evaluate how the poverty level is affected by input factors: irrigation, adoption of HYVs, fertilizer application, rural literacy rate and rural road density. It was found that marginal (incremental) impacts of irrigation followed by the rural literacy rate were larger in explaining the variation of rural poverty level in India than those of other factor-inputs selected. The marginal impact of groundwater irrigation on poverty reduction was larger than that of canal irrigation, which is due to greater control in the application and widespread use of groundwater irrigation than of canal irrigation. Despite mixed findings about the impact of irrigation on poverty from past studies, we have found large-scale marginal impacts of irrigation on rural poverty in India. This quantitative information is expected to be useful for designing targeted poverty alleviation and rural development strategies that also enhance agricultural-productivity growth.
