TI  - Empirical investigation of the agriculture–malnutrition nexus in Africa: Spatial clustering and spillover effects
PY  - 2023
AB  - Many studies have been conducted to examine the direct effect of agriculture on the prevalence of malnutrition; however, there is little solid evidence on spatial spillover effects and much less on the heterogeneous effects stemming from spatial differences in nutritional conditions. We make up this gap by using a dynamic spatial Durbin model to characterize the impact of agricultural productivity on malnutrition in Africa. Our results show that countries in Eastern Africa are more likely to suffer from severe malnutrition than other regions. We find evidence for convergence in agricultural productivity across countries with moderate and high prevalence of malnutrition as disparities in their agricultural productivity narrow down over the sample period. It appears that the negative effect of agriculture on malnutrition is more evident in countries where the prevalence of malnutrition is lower. This implies that agricultural development does not play a substantial role in reducing malnutrition in the worst affected areas. We also report that poor agricultural development can deteriorate the nutritional status among neighboring countries in the short term, consistent with the spatial-locking effect of agriculture.

TI  - How to design a complex behaviour change intervention: experiences from a nutrition-sensitive agriculture trial in rural India.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many public health interventions aim to promote healthful behaviours, with varying degrees of success. With a lack of existing empirical evidence on the optimal number or combination of behaviours to promote to achieve a given health outcome, a key challenge in intervention design lies in deciding what behaviours to prioritise, and how best to promote them. We describe how key behaviours were selected and promoted within a multisectoral nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention that aimed to address maternal and child undernutrition in rural India. First, we formulated a Theory of Change, which outlined our hypothesised impact pathways. To do this, we used the following inputs: existing conceptual frameworks, published empirical evidence, a feasibility study, formative research and the intervention team's local knowledge. Then, we selected specific behaviours to address within each impact pathway, based on our formative research, behaviour change models, local knowledge and community feedback. As the intervention progressed, we mapped each of the behaviours against our impact pathways and the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, to monitor the balance of behaviours across pathways and along stages of behaviour change. By collectively agreeing on definitions of complex concepts and hypothesised impact pathways, implementing partners were able to communicate clearly between each other and with intervention participants. Our intervention was iteratively informed by continuous review, by monitoring implementation against targets and by integrating community feedback. Impact and process evaluations will reveal whether these approaches are effective for improving maternal and child nutrition, and what the effects are on each hypothesised impact pathway.

TI  - Season of Data Collection of Child Dietary Diversity Indicators May Affect Conclusions About Longer-Term Trends in Peru, Senegal, and Nepal.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background The WHO-UNICEF minimum dietary diversity (MDD) indicator for children aged 6-23 mo is a global monitoring indicator used to track multi-year population-level changes in dietary quality, but the influence of seasonality on MDD estimates remains unclear. Objectives To examine how seasonality of data collection may influence population-level MDD estimates and inferences about MDD changes over multiple survey years. Methods We selected countries with 3 or more consecutive years of MDD data collection, including continuous national Demographic Health Surveys in Senegal (2012-2017; n = 12,183) and Peru (2005-2016; n = 35,272) and the Policy and Science for Health, Agriculture, and Nutrition sentinel site seasonal surveys (covering 3 seasons/y) in Nepal (2013-2016; n = 1309). The MDD prevalence (≥5 of 8 food groups) and an 8-item continuous Food Group Score (FGS) and 95% CIs were estimated by month and compared for lean and non-lean seasons using ordinary least squares regression with dummy variables for year. Results The national prevalence of MDD was higher in Peru (75.4%) than in Nepal (39.1%) or in Senegal (15.7%). Children in Peru were 1.8% (coefficient, -0.0179; 95% CI, -0.033 to -0.002) less likely to achieve MDD during the lean season. Similar seasonal magnitudes were observed in Senegal (coefficient, -0.0347; 95% CI, -0.058 to -0.011) and Nepal (coefficient, -0.0133; 95% CI, -0.107 to 0.081). The FGS was about 0.1 item lower during the lean season in all 3 countries. In comparison, MDD increased by an average rate of only 4.2 and 4.4 percentage points per 5 y in Peru and Senegal, respectively. Intakes of specific food groups were stable across months in all countries, with the provitamin A-rich food group exhibiting the most seasonality. Conclusions The magnitude of seasonal variation in MDD prevalence was smaller than expected but large relative to longer-term changes. If large-scale surveys are not conducted in the same season, biased conclusions about trends are possible.

TI  - Agriculture–nutrition linkages in farmers’ communication networks
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the recent development discourse, much emphasis has been placed on making agriculture more nutrition-sensitive as an important component in combating hunger and malnutrition among rural households in developing countries. In order to achieve this at scale, nutrition information could be diffused to farm households organized in community-based organizations (CBOs) through the existing agricultural extension systems. However, to date little is known about how information flows within CBOs and how extension interventions could be designed to deliver combined information on agriculture and nutrition. This study uses unique network data from 815 farm households in Kenya to investigate the structure and characteristics of agricultural and nutrition information networks within CBOs. Dyadic regressions are used to analyze the factors influencing link formation for the exchange of agricultural and nutrition information. In addition, we apply fixed-effects models to identify the characteristics of central persons driving information exchange in the two networks, as well as potentially isolated persons, who are excluded from information networks within their CBOs. Our results show that nutrition information is exchanged within CBOs, although to a limited extent, and mostly flows through the existing agricultural information links. Thus, diffusing nutrition information through agricultural extension systems may indeed be a viable approach. Our findings further suggest that group leaders and persons living in central locations are important drivers in the diffusion of information in both networks and may thus serve as suitable entry points for nutrition-sensitive extension programs. However, we also identify important heterogeneities in network characteristics. In particular, nutrition information is less often exchanged between men and women, and some group members are completely isolated from nutrition information exchange within their CBOs. We derive recommendations on taking these differences in network structure and characteristics into account when designing nutrition-sensitive extension programs.

TI  - Impact of livestock interventions on maternal and child nutrition outcomes in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The challenge of undernutrition (stunting and wasting) still remains a major health concern in children below 5 years of age in Africa, with the continent accounting for more than one third of all stunted children and more than one quarter of all wasted children globally. Despite the growing evidence on the role of agriculture interventions in improving nutrition, empirical evidence on the impact of livestock intervention on nutrition in Africa is scant. This review is aimed at determining whether livestock interventions are effective in reducing undernutrition in children below five years of age and in pregnant and lactating women in Africa. The review will be conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Major electronic databases will be searched and complemented with grey and non-indexed literature from google and google scholar, and expert consultation for additional articles and reports. PICO criteria will be used while employing search strategies including MeSH, Boolean search operators and truncation/wildcard symbol to narrow or broaden the search. Articles on effect of livestock interventions on maternal and child nutrition conducted in Africa that meet the set inclusion criteria will be included in the review after critical appraisal by two independent reviewers. A standardized form will be used to extract data from included studies. The extracted data will be summarized and synthesized both qualitatively and quantitatively and key outcomes presented. Evidence generated from the systematic review and meta-analysis will be important for guiding nutrition sensitive livestock interventions and policies on nutrition programming, specifically on how to leverage on livestock interventions to reduce the burden of undernutrition.

TI  - The Un Oeuf study: Design, methods and baseline data from a cluster randomised controlled trial to increase child egg consumption in Burkina Faso.
PY  - 2020
AB  - In many low-income countries, such as Burkina Faso, rates of malnutrition are high among children. Research indicates that animal source foods may provide important elements to improve growth and development of young children, especially during periods of rapid development, such as the first 1,000 days of life. The Un Oeuf study is designed to test an innovative behaviour change communication strategy to increase egg consumption in children 6-24 months in Burkina Faso, thereby improving dietary diversity and nutritional outcomes. This 1-year cluster randomised controlled trial tests whether the gifting of chickens by a community champion directly to a child, combined with a behaviour change package of integrated poultry management and human nutrition trainings, can significantly increase egg consumption among children under 2 years in rural communities where egg consumption is very low. The nutrition-sensitive behaviour change package is designed to increase egg consumption through improving livestock production, women's empowerment and food security at the household level. This paper presents a detailed account of the study design and protocol for the Un Oeuf study, alongside a description of the study population. Baseline data show a study population with high rates of malnutrition (stunting 21.6%, wasting 10.8% and underweight 20.4%) and a very low rate of egg consumption-less than 10% among children. Although poultry production is quite common, egg consumption is low reportedly because of cultural norms, including widespread practice of allowing eggs to hatch and a lack of knowledge about the nutritional benefits of egg consumption.

TI  - 'If he sees it with his own eyes, he will understand': how gender informed the content and delivery of a maternal nutrition intervention in Burkina Faso.
PY  - 2020
AB  - A growing body of literature urges policymakers, practitioners and scientists to consider gender in the design and evaluation of health interventions. We report findings from formative research to develop and refine an mHealth maternal nutrition intervention in Nouna, Burkina Faso, one of the world's most resource-poor settings. Gender was not an initial research focus, but emerged as highly salient during data collection, and thus guided lines of inquiry as the study progressed. We collected data in two stages, first using focus group discussions (FGD; n = 8) and later using FGDs (n = 2), interviews (n = 30) and observations of intervention delivery (n = 30). Respondents included pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and Close-to-Community (CTC) providers, who execute preventative and curative tasks at the community level. We applied Morgan et al.'s gender framework to examine intervention content (what a gender-sensitive nutrition programme should entail) and delivery (how a gender-sensitive programme should be administered). Mothers emphasized that although they are often the focus of nutrition interventions, they are not empowered to make nutrition-based decisions that incur costs. They do, however, wield some control over nutrition-related tasks such as farming and cooking. Mothers described how difficult it is to consider only one's own children during meal preparation (which is communal), and all respondents described how nutrition-related requests can spark marital strife. Many respondents agreed that involving men in nutrition interventions is vital, despite men's perceived disinterest. CTC providers and others described how social norms and gender roles underpin perceptions of CTC providers and dictate with whom they can speak within homes. Mothers often prefer female CTC providers, but these health workers require spousal permission to work and need to balance professional and domestic demands. We recommend involving male partners in maternal nutrition interventions and engaging and supporting a broader cadre of female CTC providers in Burkina Faso.

TI  - 'Men are not playing their roles', maternal and child nutrition in Nanoro, Burkina Faso.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objective To collect context-specific insights into maternal and child health and nutrition issues, and to explore potential solutions in Nanoro, Burkina Faso. Design Eleven focus groups with men and women from eleven communities, facilitated by local researchers. Setting The study took place in the Nanoro Health district, in the West-Central part of Burkina Faso. Participants Eighty-six men (18-55 years) and women by age group: 18-25; 26-34 and 35-55 years, participated in the group discussions. Results Participants described barriers to optimal nutrition of mothers and children related to a range of community factors, with gender inequality as central. Major themes in the discussions are related to poverty and challenges generated by socially and culturally determined gender roles. Sub-themes are women lacking access to food whilst pregnant and having limited access to health care and opportunities to generate income. Although communities believe that food donations should be implemented to overcome this, they also pointed out the need for enhancing their own food production, requiring improved agricultural technologies. Given the important role that women could play in reducing malnutrition, these communities felt they needed to be empowered to do so and supported by men. They also felt that this had to be carried out in the context of an enhanced health care system. Conclusions Findings reported here highlight the importance of nutrition-sensitive interventions and women's empowerment in improving maternal and child nutrition. There is a need to integrate a sustainable multi-sectorial approach which goes beyond food support.

TI  - Food security and food sources linked to dietary diversity in rural smallholder farming households in central Uganda
PY  - 2021
AB  - Undernourishment, low food quantity and poor dietary quality are common among smallholders in rural communities of Uganda. A cross-sectional study of rural smallholder farming households (n = 174) with children under five in Kiboga district, Uganda used a structured questionnaire to assess household food security status, frequency of household food consumption, and dietary diversity for children. Children's height and weight measurements were taken, and Z-scores calculated as indicators for nutritional status. Household typologies were created using principal component analysis. Households had adequate food supply for 7.6 ± 0.2 months a year; and a total of 35% were food secure. Over 7 days, starchy staples and legumes were consumed by all households; other food groups consumed were dark green leafy vegetables (43%), orange and dark-yellow foods (72%), and animal source foods (53%–60%). Roots, tubers, cooking bananas; vitamin A-rich vegetables, and legumes were sourced mainly from on-farm production, while animal source foods were mainly from the market. 76% of children consumed ≤3 food groups the previous day and 33% were stunted. Four household typologies were generated, 1st (29% households) and 2nd (23%) had more food secure households, 3rd (28%) had mild food insecurity and 4th (20%) had severe food insecurity. The 3rd and 4th typologies had the lowest dietary diversity. In summary, limited diversity of crops grown, low consumption of micronutrient-rich foods, child stunting, and household food insecurity were observed, while own production and markets were the main sources of food. The four household typologies can be used to develop context specific strategies to improve dietary diversity.

TI  - Understanding the nourishment of bodies at the centre of food and health systems - systemic, bodily and new materialist perspectives on nutritional inequity.
PY  - 2019
AB  - That nutritional inequalities continue to proliferate at a global level requires new insight from all disciplines, given their formation at the intersection of broader inequities in food, health and other systems. This paper argues that critical social scientific perspectives are needed to supplement public health and food focused approaches, which, while helpful, tend to reduce research and intervention to remedial action on malnourished bodies or on food production. A number of alternative perspectives draw on work on both bodies and on systems which are reviewed here. Because both the causes and the impacts of poor nutrition are simultaneously embodied and systemic, our understanding is weakened without considering both sets of literature simultaneously. New-materialist, assemblage or posthuman approaches represent an evolution of these literatures which can reflect on dissolving socio-natural boundaries within contemporary (nutritional) science, whilst retaining a critical edge. Together, the various approaches within this paper help consider the conditions of everyday existence for those living with malnutrition and the range of bodily and systemic factors which assemble their condition.

TI  - Women's empowerment and gender-differentiated food allocation in Bangladesh
PY  - 2021
AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of women’s empowerment on two aspects of food security—calorie and protein intake of children—using data on agricultural households from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey. We are interested both in the differential impact of mother’s empowerment on the food security of boys and girls as well as in whether different aspects of empowerment have different effects. There are 10 different aspects of empowerment including making production decisions, owning and selling assets, being a member of a group and so on. Our estimates suggest that, in households with more empowered women, children enjoy higher calorie and protein intake but that daughters are disadvantaged relative to sons. Most importantly, mother’s empowerment is an important source of gender discrimination. When considering the sub-components of empowerment, we find that input into production decisions are important for both calorie consumption and protein. These findings are robust to a host of controls including household poverty, sibling composition, community social norms and individual characteristics.

TI  - Coherence for nutrition: insights from nutrition-relevant policies and programmes in Burkina Faso and Nigeria.
PY  - 2021
AB  - There is consensus that policy coherence is necessary for implementing effective and sustainable approaches to tackle malnutrition. We look at whether policies and programmes provide a coherent pathway to address nutrition priorities and if programmes are designed to deliver interventions aligned to the nutrition policy agenda in Nigeria and Burkina Faso. A systematic desk review was performed on nutrition-relevant policy and programme documents, obtained through grey literature searches and expert recommendations. We developed a framework with an impact pathway structure that includes five process steps, which was used to guide coding, data reduction and synthesis and structure the analysis. We assessed internal coherence along process steps within a given document and external coherence across process steps for explicitly linked policy/programme pairs. The majority of policies and programmes had partial internal coherence for both countries. The identification of relevant nutrition interventions to address challenges and reach objectives was the strongest connection within policies (16 out of 45 had complete coherence), while among programmes, the strongest connection was coverage indicators that measure interventions (9 out of 21 had complete coherence). Eight programmes explicitly referenced at least one nutrition-relevant policy, with a total of 16 linked policy/programme pairs (13 pairs for Burkina Faso and 3 for Nigeria) across health, nutrition, agriculture and social focus areas. However, none of the linked pairs were assessed to have complete external coherence, suggesting that priorities at the policy level are not fully realized nor translated at the programme level. This study offers a new approach for the assessment of policy and programme coherence and specifically examines policy and programme linkages. We conclude that improved leadership on country priority setting and better alignment for nutrition within and across sectors is needed to enhance the effectiveness of nutrition investments.

TI  - Agricultural land resource allocation to develop food crop commodities: lesson from Indonesia.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract This study estimates agricultural land resource allocation to develop food-crop commodities in order to safeguard food security in Indonesia in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. The recommended commodities to be developed in Indonesia are corn, soybean, mungbean, peanut, and rice that are produced with advanced technology and input-output coefficient. There are five introduced scenarios namely, basic scenario, I, II, III, and IV. There are problems related to resource allocation such as limited resources, the ways of using it, and time constraints. In order to maintain and improve the comparative advantage of agricultural production as well as to broaden the agricultural activities, agricultural development is directed to increase business efficiency, improvements in agricultural science, technology, and human resource quality. The utilization of agricultural land resources should be well-planned for better development.

TI  - Animal Source Food Social and Behavior Change Communication Intervention Among Girinka Livestock Transfer Beneficiaries in Rwanda: A Cluster Randomized Evaluation.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Animal source foods (ASFs), including cow's milk, contain essential nutrients and contribute to a healthy diet, but frequency of intake is low among children in low- and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that an ASF social and behavior change communication (SBCC) intervention implemented by community health workers (CHWs) would increase child milk consumption and dietary diversity in households that received a cow from the Government of Rwanda's Girinka livestock transfer program. We tested the 9-month SBCC intervention among children aged 12-29 months at baseline in administrative cells randomly assigned to the intervention or control. Most mothers in the intervention group were exposed to CHWs' home visits (90.7%) or community-level activities (82.8%). At endline, more mothers in the intervention group compared with the control group knew that cow's milk was an ASF (90.1% vs. 81.7%, P=.03) and could be introduced to children at 12 months (41.7% vs. 18.7%, P<.001). More mothers in the intervention group compared with the control group knew they should feed their children ASFs (76.2% vs. 62.1%, P=.01) and give them 1 cup of cow's milk per day (20.6% vs. 7.8%, P<.001). Children's consumption of fresh cow's milk 2 or more times per week increased in the intervention group, although not significantly (8.0 percentage points, P=.17); minimum dietary diversity was unchanged. Children in the intervention group had increased odds of consuming cow's milk 2 or more times per week if their mothers recalled hearing that children should drink 1 cup of cow's milk per day during a CHW's home visit [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.1, 3.9)] or a community activity [OR 2.0, 95% CI (1.2, 3.5)]. Approximately half of the children had no milk during the past week because their households produced too little or sold what was produced. In poor households receiving a livestock transfer, strategies to further tailor SBCC and increase cow's milk production may be needed to achieve larger increases in children's frequency of milk consumption.

TI  - Perspective: What Does Stunting Really Mean? A Critical Review of the Evidence
PY  - 2019
AB  - The past decade has seen an unprecedented increase in attention to undernutrition, and drastically reducing child stunting has become a global development objective. The strong focus on linear growth retardation and stunting has enabled successful advocacy for nutrition, but with this focus has come some confusion and misunderstanding about the meaning of linear growth retardation and stunting among researchers, donors, and agencies active in nutrition. Motivated by the belief that a sharp focus will further accelerate progress in reducing undernutrition, we critically reviewed the evidence. The global attention to stunting is based on the premise that any intervention aimed at improving linear growth will subsequently lead to improvements in the correlates of linear growth retardation and stunting. Current evidence and understanding of mechanisms does not support this causal thinking, with 2 exceptions: linear growth retardation is a cause of difficult births and poor birth outcomes. Linear growth retardation is associated with (but does not cause) delayed child development, reduced earnings in adulthood, and chronic diseases. We thus propose distinguishing 2 distinctly different meanings of linear growth retardation and stunting. First, the association between linear growth retardation (or stunting) and other outcomes makes it a useful marker. Second, the causal links with difficult births and poor birth outcomes make linear growth retardation and stunting outcomes of intrinsic value. In many cases a focus on linear growth retardation and stunting is not necessary to improve the well-being of children; in many other cases, it is not sufficient to reach that goal; and for some outcomes, promoting linear growth is not the most cost-efficient strategy. We appeal to donors, program planners, and researchers to be specific in selecting nutrition outcomes and to target those outcomes directly.

TI  - Stories of change in nutrition in Burkina Faso 1992-2018: a micro-level perspective.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText>Looking back at what has effectively improved nutrition may inform policy makers on how to accelerate progress to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. As under-five stunting declined substantially in Burkina Faso, we analyzed its nutrition story at the micro-level. We conducted a regression-decomposition analysis to identify demographic and health drivers associated with change in height-for-age using longitudinal, secondary, nationally-representative data. We triangulated results with findings from semi-structured community interviews (n = 91) in two "model communities" with a history of large stunting reduction. We found that improvement in immunization coverage, assets accumulation and reduction in open defecation were associated with 23%, 10% and 6.1% of the improvement in height-for-age, respectively. Associations were also found with other education, family planning, health and WASH indicators. Model communities acknowledged progress in the coverage and quality of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive sectoral programs co-located at the community level, especially those delivered through the health and food security sectors, though delivery challenges remained in a context of systemic poverty and persistent food insecurity. Burkina Faso's health sector's success in improving coverage of nutrition and healthcare programs may have contributed to improvements in child nutrition alongside other programmatic improvements in the food security, WASH and education sectors. Burkina Faso should continue to operationalize sectoral nutrition-sensitive policies into higher-quality programs at scale, building on its success stories such as vaccination. Community leverage gaps and data gaps need to be filled urgently to pressure for and monitor high coverage, quality delivery, and nutrition impact of agriculture, education, and WASH interventions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Supplementary Information" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12571-022-01274-z.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Poverty, price and preference barriers to improving diets in sub-Saharan Africa.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Suboptimal diets are the most important preventable risk factor for the global burden of non-communicable diseases. The EAT-<i>Lancet</i> reference diet was therefore developed as a benchmark for gauging divergence from healthy eating standards. However, no previous research has comprehensively explored how and why this divergence exists in poorer countries undergoing nutrition transitions. This study therefore analyzes dietary patterns and drivers of the demand for nutritious foods using nationally representative household surveys from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. We show how barriers to dietary convergence stem from combinations of poverty, high relative food prices and weak preferences for some specific healthy foods. The article concludes by discussing interventions for strengthening consumer demand for healthy diets in Africa.

TI  - How to Make Farming and Agricultural Extension More Nutrition- Sensitive: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Kenya
PY  - 2018
AB  - We analyse how agricultural extension can be made more effective in terms of increasing farmers’ adoption of pro-nutrition technologies, such as biofortified crops. In a randomised controlled trial with farmers in Kenya, we implemented several extension treatments and evaluated their effects on the adoption of beans biofortified with iron and zinc. Difference-in-difference estimates show that intensive agricultural training can increase technology adoption considerably. Additional nutrition training helps farmers to better appreciate the technology’s nutritional benefits and thus further increases adoption. This study is among the first to analyse how improved extension designs can help to make smallholder farming more nutrition-sensitive.

TI  - Modelling the potential cost-effectiveness of food-based programs to reduce malnutrition.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Poor quality diets contribute to malnutrition globally, but evidence is weak on the cost-effectiveness of food-based interventions that shift diets. This study assessed 11 candidate interventions developed through Delphi techniques to improve diets in India, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. A Markov simulation model incorporated time, individual-level, nutrition, and policy parameters to estimate health impacts and cost-effectiveness for reducing stunting, anaemia, diarrhea, and mortality in preschool children. At an assumed 80% coverage, interventions considered would potentially save between 0·16 and 3·20 years of life per child. The average cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from US$9 to US$2000 per life year saved. This approach, linking expert knowledge, known costs, and modelling, offers potential for estimating cost-effective investments for better informed policy choice where empirical evidence is limited.

TI  - Building Implementation Science in Nutrition.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The field of nutrition has been investing in the development of many nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs aimed at improving population-level malnutrition in all its forms. When there is a need to learn about a new system, programmatic context, or target population to understand how to effectively deploy an intervention to help improve nutrition, it is important to be able to ask a broad range of questions, both in topic and in scope. Our aim is to provide a simple and conceptually clear definition and principles to elaborate the science of implementation for nutrition to distinguish it from other ways of knowing and learning and to serve as a guide to the articulation of implementation science questions and methods. Implementation science is a body of systematized knowledge about how to improve implementation that 1) is distinguished by its aims to learn about the process of implementation, 2) uses methods that derive from and fit with the aims, and 3) is built with tacit (as well as expert) knowledge and experiential learning. Implementation science aims to generate the learning needed to improve implementation through facilitating collaboration among stakeholders to articulate and pursue the aims; capturing and using tacit knowledge and experiential learning from stakeholders, systems, providers, and recipients; and applying a mix of methods suited to the aims. This elaboration of the science provides a simple way to help those who already do, or want to do, implementation science understand and communicate how this science is unique and the value that it adds to the current landscape of nutrition priorities, innovations, and the attendant complex learning needs that follow. Implementation science encompasses both discovery- and mission-oriented research, and centers implementation as the object of study for the purposes of broad-based learning.

TI  - Evaluating farm-level livestock interventions in low-income countries: a scoping review of what works, how, and why
PY  - 2020
AB  - Livestock interventions can improve nutrition, health, and economic well-being of communities. The objectives of this review were to identify and characterize livestock interventions in developing countries and to assess their effectiveness in achieving development outcomes. A scoping review, guided by a search strategy, was conducted. Papers needed to be written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and describe interventions in animal health and production. Out of 2739 publications systematically screened at the title, abstract, and full publication levels, 70 met our inclusion criteria and were considered in the study. Eight relatively high-quality papers were identified and added, resulting in 78 reviewed publications. Only 15 studies used randomized controlled trial designs making it possible to confidently link interventions with the resulting outcomes. Eight studies had human nutrition or health as outcomes, 11 focused on disease control, and four were on livestock production. Eight interventions were considered successful, but only four were scalable. We found good evidence that livestock-transfer programs, leveraging livestock products for nutrition, and helping farmers manage priority diseases, can improve human well-being. Our report highlights challenges in garnering evidence for livestock interventions in developing countries and provides suggestions on how to improve the quantity and quality of future evaluations.

TI  - Leveraging smallholder livestock production to reduce anemia: A qualitative study of three agroecological zones in Ghana
PY  - 2018
AB  - Livestock production and Animal-Source Foods (ASFs) like meat, milk, and eggs are excellent sources of essential micronutrients, including iron and zinc. There is evidence that encouraging increased access to and consumption of these ASFs may either positively or negatively impact anemia, or have no nutritional effects. Drawing upon first-hand experiences in Ghana, this study sought to: (1) identify the main motivations for raising livestock in Ghana; (2) describe the major barriers to consuming ASFs, especially among women of reproductive age (WRA); and (3) explore the feasibility of different livestock-centered interventions to reduce anemia. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were held with relevant stakeholders at different geographical scales - the national, regional, district, and community levels. The results suggest that livestock enable savings, allow resource-poor households to accumulate assets, and help finance planned and unplanned expenditures (e.g., school fees and illness). Due to these multiple and often pressing uses, direct consumption of home-reared ASFs is not a major priority, especially for poor households. Even when ASFs are consumed, intra-household allocation does not favor women and adolescent girls, demographic groups with particularly high micronutrient requirements. The study participants discussed possible interventions to address these challenges, including (1) increasing livestock ownership through in-kind credit; (2) encouraging nutrition-related behavior change; (3) improving livestock housing; and (4) hatchery management. The paper discusses these interventions based upon potential acceptance, feasibility, cost effectiveness, and sustainability in the Ghanaian context.

TI  - How light is too light touch: The effect of a short training-based intervention on household poultry production in Burkina Faso
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abstract This paper reports on the effects of a training-based intervention seeking to increase household engagement in poultry production in Burkina Faso, analyzing data from a large-scale cluster randomized trial in which 1798 households in 60 communes were observed over a period of three years. The intervention SELEVER — entailing a short series of trainings for households as well as capacity building for local animal health and credit services — had little effect on household poultry production and no effect on profits. There is some evidence of an increase in the utilization of poultry inputs and an associated reduction in poultry mortality, primarily for larger poultry producers; however, there is no evidence of any treatment effects for the smallest producers.

TI  - The impact of gender equity in agriculture on nutritional status, diets, and household food security: a mixed-methods systematic review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Introduction Undernutrition rates remain high in rural, low-income settings, where large, gender-based inequities persist. We hypothesised that increasing gender equity in agriculture could improve nutrition. Methods We conducted a systematic review to assess the associations between gender-based inequities (in income, land, livestock, and workloads) and nutrition, diets and food security outcomes in agricultural contexts of low-income and middle-income countries. Between 9 March and 7 August 2018, we searched 18 databases and 14 journals, and contacted 27 experts. We included quantitative and qualitative literature from agricultural contexts in low-income and middle-income countries, with no date restriction. Outcomes were women’s and children’s anthropometric status, dietary quality and household food security. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. Results We identified 19 820 records, of which 34 studies (42 809 households) met the inclusion criteria. Most (22/25) quantitative studies had a high risk of bias, and qualitative evidence was of mixed quality. Income, land and livestock equity had heterogeneous associations with household food security and child anthropometric outcomes. Meta-analyses showed women’s share of household income earned (0.32, 95% CI −4.22 to 4.86; six results) and women’s share of land owned (2.72, 95% CI -0.52 to 5.96; three results) did not increase the percentage of household budget spent on food. Higher-quality studies showed more consistently positive associations between income equity and food security. Evidence is limited on other exposure–outcome pairings. Conclusions We find heterogeneous associations between gender equity and household-level food security. High-quality research is needed to establish the impact of gender equity on nutrition outcomes across contexts.

TI  - Men's nutrition knowledge is important for women's and children's nutrition in Ethiopia.
PY  - 2020
AB  - In an effort to address undernutrition among women and children in rural areas of low-income countries, nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) and behaviour change communication (BCC) projects heavily focus on women as an entry point to effect nutritional outcomes. There is limited evidence on the role of men's contribution in improving household diets. In this Agriculture to Nutrition trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03152227), we explored associations between men's and women's nutritional knowledge on households', children's and women's dietary diversity. At the midline evaluation conducted in July 2017, FAO's nutrition knowledge questionnaire was administered to male and female partners in 1396 households. There was a high degree of agreement (88%) on knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding between parents; however, only 56-66% of the households had agreement when comparing knowledge of dietary sources of vitamin A or iron. Factor analysis of knowledge dimensions resulted in identifying two domains, namely, 'dietary' and 'vitamin' knowledge. Dietary knowledge had a larger effect on women's and children's dietary diversities than vitamin knowledge. Men's dietary knowledge had strong positive associations with households' dietary diversity scores (0.24, P value = 0.001), children's dietary diversity (0.19, P value = 0.008) and women's dietary diversity (0.18, P value < 0.001). Distance to markets and men's education levels modified the effects of nutrition knowledge on dietary diversity. While previous NSA and BCC interventions predominantly focused on uptake among women, there is a large gap and strong potential for men's engagement in improving household nutrition. Interventions that expand the role of men in NSA may synergistically improve household nutrition outcomes.

TI  - Validation of a roadmap for mainstreaming nutrition-sensitive interventions at state level in Nigeria
PY  - 2020
AB  - National programs are often developed with little consideration to the sub-national local factors that might affect program success. These factors include political support, capacity for implementation of program and variation in malnutrition indices being tackled. State context factors are evident in the distribution of malnutrition (e.g. high prevalence or gap among Local Government Areas), in the implementation of nutrition-sensitive interventions (e.g. access to early childhood education) and in the political economic context (e.g. presence of external funding agencies). Context is shaped by the economy, population, religion, and poverty, which impact everyday lives. Considering these contexts, a roadmap was developed and validated. The aim of this paper is to report expert review and stakeholder validation to determine feasibility of the developed contextualised roadmap for two Nigerian states. A validation tool was developed and reviewed using three experts. The content review occurred in two rounds to obtain recommendation and revisions of the developed roadmap and the validation tool. A pilot test of the roadmap and validation tool was done using two stakeholders in South Africa. The roadmap and the validation tool were then sent to the stakeholders and potential end-users in Nigeria using electronic media. Two research assistants were also engaged to deliver and collect hard copies to those who preferred it. Of the ten stakeholders invited, nine responded. All participants showed an adequate understanding of the roadmap as evidenced by the scores given. Responses regarding the translation of the roadmap to implementation varied. The majority (86,6%) either strongly agreed or agreed that the actions were translatable (43.0 and 43.6% respectively). The final roadmap comprises of actions that are appropriate for the state’s context. It is recommended that stakeholders or end-users of any programme must be involved in the validation of such contextual programmes to improve chances of success.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE">Identify and describe the available evidence on the effects food systems interventions on food security and nutrition outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS">An adapted version of the high-level panel of experts food systems framework defined the interventions and outcomes included studies. Included study designs were experimental and quasi-experimental quantitative impact evaluations and systematic reviews. Following standards for evidence gap maps developed by 3ie, a systematic search of 17 academic databases and 31 sector-specific repositories in May 2020 identified articles for inclusion. Trained consultants screened titles/abstracts, then full texts of identified articles. Studies meeting eligibility criteria had meta-data systematically extracted and were descriptively analysed. Systematic reviews were critically appraised.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The map includes 1838 impact evaluations and 178 systematic reviews. The most common interventions, with over 100 impact evaluations and 20 systematic reviews each, were: provision of supplements, fortification, nutrition classes, direct provision of foods and peer support/counselling. Few studies addressed national-level interventions or women's empowerment. The most common final outcomes were: anthropometry, micronutrient status, and diet quality and adequacy. Intermediate outcomes were less studied.Most evaluations were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (33%) or South Asia (20%). Many studies occurred in lower-middle-income countries (43%); few (7%) were in fragile countries. Among studies in a specific age group, infants were most frequently included (19%); 14% of these also considered mothers.Few evaluations considered qualitative or cost analysis; 75% used randomisation as the main identification strategy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION">The uneven distribution of research means that some interventions have established impacts while other interventions, often affecting large populations, are underevaluated. Areas for future research include the evaluation of national level policies, evaluation of efforts to support women's empowerment within the food system, and the synthesis of dietary quality.

TI  - Building Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security in Africa: Focusing on Small-Scale Farmers
PY  - 2023
AB  - Food and nutrition security has become an important policy agenda in the international community. Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food and nutrition security, and promote sustainable agriculture. However, this goal will likely be challenged by emerging risks such as climate change in many developing countries. The Six Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that climate change will affect food security, especially in Africa, since the majority in the rural areas are rainfed small-scale farmers who are directly affected by climate change. Thus, policy intervention is urgently required to build climate resilience in the agricultural sector. To envision nutrition-sensitive agricultural production and consumption system, we first need to understand i) how farmers manage climate risks? ii) What technical options enhance farmers’ food and nutrition security? This paper tries to present some current evidence regarding those links in the literature, provide some empirical evidence on small-scale farmers in one of the drought-prone areas in southern Zambia, and envision the future direction of research.

TI  - Community perspectives on maternal and child health during nutrition and economic transition in sub-Saharan Africa.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objective: To explore community perceptions on maternal and child nutrition issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. Design: Thirty focus groups with men and women from three communities facilitated by local researchers. Setting: One urban (Soweto, South Africa) and two rural settings (Navrongo, Ghana and Nanoro, Burkina Faso) at different stages of economic transition. Participants: Two hundred thirty-seven men and women aged 18–55 years, mostly subsistence farmers in Navrongo and Nanoro and low income in Soweto. Results: Differences in community concerns about maternal and child health and nutrition reflected the transitional stage of the country. Community priorities revolved around poor nutrition and hunger caused by poverty, lack of economic opportunity and traditional gender roles. Men and women felt they had limited control over food and other resources. Women wanted men to take more responsibility for domestic chores, including food provision, while men wanted more involvement in their families but felt unable to provide for them. Solutions suggested focusing on ways of increasing control over economic production, family life and domestic food supplies. Rural communities sought agricultural support, while the urban community wanted regulation of the food environment. Conclusions: To be acceptable and effective, interventions to improve maternal and child nutrition need to take account of communities’ perceptions of their needs and address wider determinants of nutritional status and differences in access to food reflecting the stage of the country’s economic transition. Findings suggest that education and knowledge are necessary but not sufficient to support improvements in women’s and children’s nutritional status.

TI  - Impact of a homestead food production program on women's empowerment: Pro-WEAI results from the FAARM trial in Bangladesh.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs have the potential to improve women's and children's nutrition, along with women's empowerment. The project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) aims to standardize the measurement of women's agency and enable the assessment of impact over typical project timelines. Within the Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Habiganj, Sylhet, Bangladesh, we examined quantitative pro-WEAI data collected from a subsample of trial participants and their husbands (n = 885) approximately four months after the end of the intervention. We evaluated the impact of a three-year homestead food production program on men's and women's agency separately by pro-WEAI domain and indicator, using multilevel logistic and linear regression. We show that women in the FAARM intervention group had levels of agency similar to men and much higher than women in the control group (Odds Ratio [OR] 7.7, p < 0.001), corresponding to better gender equity in intervention areas (OR 3.5, p < 0.001). The higher levels of agency among intervention women were driven by greater intrinsic and collective agency but not by instrumental agency. Compared to controls, more women in the intervention group found intimate partner violence unacceptable (OR 3.5, p < 0.001), had greater ownership of assets (OR 2.6, p = 0.001), better control of income (OR 1.8, p = 0.042), higher levels of group membership (OR 14.0, p < 0.001), and membership in groups they considered influential (OR 166.8, p < 0.001). Self-efficacy was greater in intervention areas for both women (OR 3.2, p < 0.001) and men (OR 2.3, p = 0.002). Our results contribute to the development of benchmarks for interpreting pro-WEAI scores across programs. Our assessment of the impact of a homestead food production program on women's agency provides additional rationale for women-led agricultural projects. We plan to build on these findings by examining the role of improved women's agency on the pathway from the intervention to nutritional impacts.

TI  - Evidence-Based Design Process for Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture Interventions: A Case Study of the Advancing Local Dairy Development Programme in Nigeria.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Nigeria is a significant contributor to the global burden of chronic undernutrition in children under 5 years of age. The undernutrition challenge constrains the productivity of rural households. This study was carried out among beneficiaries of the productivity-enhancing Nigerian Dairy Development Programme (NDDP) to guide incorporation of nutrition into the successor program-Advancing Local Dairy Development in Nigeria (ALDDN). Therefore, this study contributes to the literature about operationalizing nutrition-sensitive agricultural frameworks.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study sought to determine potential entry points for improving the nutrition of smallholder dairy farmers (≤=5 milk cows) with a focus on food system entry points.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Primary data were collected from 514 smallholder dairy households in Oyo and Kano states of Nigeria. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data collected included minimum dietary diversity for women, nutrition status, and socioeconomic characteristics of households. Qualitative data included information about sources of food, markets, and other food system characteristics. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistical tools and correlation analysis, while common themes were identified from qualitative data.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study showcased men's important role in food purchase and consumption, particularly in Kano. Increasing opportunities and the ability of women to use nutrition education appeared necessary for translating knowledge into improved practices.

TI  - Food security and child malnutrition in the regions of Maradi, Tahoua and Tillabéri in Niger: The status, the causes, and transformative change
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="fr">&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research was undertaken in the agropastoral regions of Maradi, Tahoua and Tillabéri in Niger. The first study covered 900 households and assessed farmers production methods, income, household expenditure, gender issues and food security using four different indicators. The second study assessed causes for child malnutrition by combining a household survey (450 households) with measurement of the upper arm circumference of 1618 children aged 6 to 59 months from these households. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify the causes for malnutrition. The number of food-insecure months in the households were on average 3.54 months per year and 11.4% of the children belonged to the group defined as suffering from 'global acute malnutrition'. Cereal yields were below 250 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and only 33% of the households were able to sell any of their cereal harvest. The households spent 66% of their total expenditure on the purchase of food. Money spent on diversifying their nutrition was very limited and horticulture production focused on temperate crops. The indicators for nutrition diversity, food quality and household perception of food security were low. The major causes identified for food insecurity and child malnutrition were low agricultural production, low nutritional diversity, women's autonomy in agriculture (control over income) and poor sanitation. To address these challenges, we propose a mix of incremental and transformative changes, including strengthening the role of women, promotion of precision farming, nutrient-sensitive agriculture, eco-sanitation, and training on improved nutrition and childcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>

TI  - Effect of nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions with participatory videos and women's group meetings on maternal and child nutritional outcomes in rural Odisha, India (UPAVAN trial): a four-arm, observer-blind, cluster-randomised controlled trial
PY  - 2021
AB  - Summary Background Almost a quarter of the world's undernourished people live in India. We tested the effects of three nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions on maternal and child nutrition in India. Methods We did a parallel, four-arm, observer-blind, cluster-randomised trial in Keonjhar district, Odisha, India. A cluster was one or more villages with a combined minimum population of 800 residents. The clusters were allocated 1:1:1:1 to a control group or an intervention group of fortnightly women's groups meetings and household visits over 32 months using: NSA videos (AGRI group); NSA and nutrition-specific videos (AGRI-NUT group); or NSA videos and a nutrition-specific participatory learning and action (PLA) cycle meetings and videos (AGRI-NUT+PLA group). Primary outcomes were the proportion of children aged 6–23 months consuming at least four of seven food groups the previous day and mean maternal body-mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes were proportion of mothers consuming at least five of ten food groups and child wasting (proportion of children with weight-for-height Z score SD Findings 148 of 162 clusters assessed for eligibility were enrolled and randomly allocated to trial groups (37 clusters per group). Baseline surveys took place from Nov 24, 2016, to Jan 24, 2017; clusters were randomised from December, 2016, to January, 2017; and interventions were implemented from March 20, 2017, to Oct 31, 2019, and endline surveys done from Nov 19, 2019, to Jan 12, 2020, in an average of 32 households per cluster. All clusters were included in the analyses. There was an increase in the proportion of children consuming at least four of seven food groups in the AGRI-NUT (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1·19, 95% CI 1·03 to 1·37, p=0·02) and AGRI-NUT+PLA (1·27, 1·11 to 1·46, p=0·001) groups, but not AGRI (1·06, 0·91 to 1·23, p=0·44), compared with the control group. We found no effects on mean maternal BMI (adjusted mean differences vs control, AGRI −0·05, −0·34 to 0·24; AGRI-NUT 0·04, −0·26 to 0·33; AGRI-NUT+PLA −0·03, −0·3 to 0·23). An increase in the proportion of mothers consuming at least five of ten food groups was seen in the AGRI (adjusted RR 1·21, 1·01 to 1·45) and AGRI-NUT+PLA (1·30, 1·10 to 1·53) groups compared with the control group, but not in AGRI-NUT (1·16, 0·98 to 1·38). We found no effects on child wasting (adjusted RR vs control, AGRI 0·95, 0·73 to 1·24; AGRI-NUT 0·96, 0·72 to 1·29; AGRI-NUT+PLA 0·96, 0·73 to 1·26). Interpretation Women's groups using combinations of NSA videos, nutrition-specific videos, and PLA cycle meetings improved maternal and child diet quality in rural Odisha, India. These components have been implemented separately in several low-income settings; effects could be increased by scaling up together.

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programme impacts on time use and associations with nutrition outcomes.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Success of nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes targeted to women may be influenced by increased demands on women's and other household members' time and by time-related trade-offs to accommodate programme participation. However, evidence of how such programmes impact time use and whether changes in time-related demands negatively influence maternal or child health and nutrition outcomes is limited. This paper examines the impact of Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production programme in Burkina Faso (2010-2012) on women's and men's time use and associations between changes in women's time use and maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes. We used quantitative data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial (baseline 2010, endline 2012) and qualitative data from two rounds of process evaluation (2011, 2012). Two-stage analyses were used to first assess programme impacts on women's and men's time use using difference-in-difference impact estimates and second to evaluate whether programme impacts on women's time use were associated with changes in women's and children's health and nutrition outcomes. Programme impacts were considered significant if corrected P < 0.01, and associations were considered significant if p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. Qualitative data were analysed through manual coding and by calculating the means and standard deviations for the time spent by women and men on activities in intervention and control groups. Findings show that the programme significantly increased the amount of time women spent on agriculture in the intervention compared to the control group, but this was not associated with changes in maternal or child health or nutrition outcomes. Process evaluation data supported these findings.

TI  - What is the cost of integration? Evidence from an integrated health and agriculture project to improve nutrition outcomes in Western Kenya.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Integrated nutrition and agricultural interventions have the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in food security and nutrition. This article aimed to estimate the costs of an integrated agriculture and health intervention (Mama SASHA) focused on the promotion of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) production and consumption in Western Kenya. Programme activities included nutrition education and distribution of vouchers for OFSP vines during antenatal care and postnatal care (PNC) visits. We used expenditures and activity-based costing to estimate the financial costs during programme implementation (2011-13). Cost data were collected from monthly expense reports and interviews with staff members from all implementing organizations. Financial costs totalled US$507 809 for the project period. Recruiting and retaining women over the duration of their pregnancy and postpartum period required significant resources. Mama SASHA reached 3281 pregnant women at a cost of US$155 per beneficiary. Including both pregnant women and infants who attended PNC services with their mothers, the cost was US$110 per beneficiary. Joint planning, co-ordination and training across sectors drove 27% of programme costs. This study found that the average cost per beneficiary to implement an integrated agriculture, health and nutrition programme was substantial. Planning and implementing less intensive integrated interventions may be possible, and economies of scale may reduce overall costs. Empirical estimates of costs by components are critical for future planning and scaling up of integrated programmes.

TI  - Women’s Agricultural Work and Nutrition in South Asia: From Pathways to a Cross-Disciplinary, Grounded Analytical Framework
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract In this systematic review, we aim to examine the impact of women’s work in agriculture on maternal and child nutrition in South Asia. Building on previous reviews supported under the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) consortium, and recent published literature, we include findings from new LANSA research. While mapping literature onto the gender-nutrition pathways linking agriculture to nutrition (Kadiyala et al., 2014), we also point to conceptual and methodological directions for further exploration emerging from our work. Key amongst these are a focus on seasonality, poverty, and gender relations, moving beyond both an exclusive focus on women as a unified and homogenous group, and agriculture as an unchanging and common set of activities and production processes. Our analysis suggests the need for a more contextualised approach, and for a richer cross-disciplinary framework for effectively addressing the ways in which women’s work mediates agriculture’s role in improving child and maternal nutrition in South Asia.

TI  - Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM): protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a Homestead Food Production programme on undernutrition in rural Bangladesh
PY  - 2019
AB  - Introduction Chronic undernutrition affects over 150 million children worldwide and has serious consequences. The causes are complex and include insufficient dietary diversity and poor hygiene practices. Systematic reviews of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions concluded that while these hold promise, there is insufficient evidence for their impact on child growth. The Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) project is a 1:1 cluster-randomised trial aiming to evaluate the impact of a Homestead Food Production (HFP) programme implemented by Helen Keller International on women’s and children’s undernutrition. Methods and analysis The HFP intervention comprises training of women’s groups and asset distribution to support year-round home gardening, poultry rearing and improved nutrition and hygiene practices. Formal trainings are supplemented by behaviour change communication during household visits, and facilitated links between producer groups and market actors. The FAARM trial will examine if and how this complex intervention reduces undernutrition. In 2015, FAARM enrolled married women and their children (0–3 years) in 96 rural settlements of Habiganj district in Sylhet division, Bangladesh. Covariate-constrained randomisation was used to assign 48 settlements to receive a 3-year HFP intervention, with the other 48 acting as controls, targeting over 2700 women. To study impact pathways, a surveillance system collects data on all participants every 2 months. In late 2019, children 0–3 years of age (born during the intervention period) will be surveyed, thus capturing impact during the critical first 1000 days of life. Children’s length/height-for-age z-scores will be compared between intervention and control arms using mixed-effects linear regression. Secondary outcomes include women’s and children’s micronutrient status, dietary intake, dietary diversity and other indicators of child growth, development and morbidity. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was received in Bangladesh and Germany. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations in Bangladesh and internationally. Trial registration number NCT02505711; Pre-results.

TI  - Farm-level pathways to food security: beyond missing markets and irrational peasants
PY  - 2021
AB  - Development projects in Sub-Saharan Africa propose to alleviate hunger in rural areas by introducing new agricultural practices and technologies, yet there is limited empirical evidence of how an agricultural intervention can lead farming households to transition to food security. Research on food security pathways considers agricultural interventions that increase farmers’ income to be particularly effective for reducing food insecurity. Consistent with this stance, Malawian agricultural policy aims to address hunger by encouraging smallholder farmers to intensify and commercialize maize production. This paper explores if smallholders’ market and livelihood orientations do indeed lead them to favor an income pathway to food security. Qualitative analysis of 60 smallholder farmer interviews in Malawi found that, upon achieving improvements in production yields and diversity, rather than commercialize, many farmers re-organized their production and consumption to reduce market dependency. Farmers deployed this strategy to increase their food security, explaining that the choice to self-provision food and farming inputs was both an expression of farming identity and a lived understanding of their marginal position in commodity markets. The author finds that, in failing to consider how production relations affect food access, scholarship inadequately theorizes farm-level food security transitions and reproduces discursive framings of hunger. Food sovereignty narratives more accurately captured what mattered for Malawian smallholders’ food security, suggesting that engagement with this concept could improve scientific understandings of food security transitions.

TI  - Nutrition in contemporary Zimbabwe: a situational analysis
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: Malnutrition in all its forms continues to be a global public health challenge affecting mostly women and children in Africa. The socioeconomic consequences of poor nutrition are far-reaching and cross-generational. Objective: To provide an update on the nutrition situation in Zimbabwe in the context of the United Nations 2030 sustainable development agenda. Key findings: In Zimbabwe, the leading nutrition problems include high levels of childhood stunting, micronutrient deficiencies (Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, and Selenium) affecting mostly children younger than 5 years and women aged 15-49 years. This paper presents evidence on the emergence of obesity and associated complications like diabetes, hypertension, and several cancers in addition to the traditional problem of undernutrition burden “multiple burden of malnutrition”. These nutrition challenges can be attributed to poor breastfeeding and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, the low dietary diversity affecting mostly rural households and nutrition transition. Cultural and religious beliefs are barriers to the adoption of appropriate breastfeeding and IYCF practices. Conclusion: The multiple burden of malnutrition exists in Zimbabwe. Although there is political, commitment and multisectoral initiatives to address malnutrition and food insecurity, the declining socio-economic situation and the COVID-19 associated restrictions are worsening the situation and poor households are getting more vulnerable. Considering that Zimbabwe’s economy is agriculture-based there is a need to put emphasis on promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture initiatives and urgently implement the Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) to propel the adoption of healthy lifestyles and dietary behaviors.

TI  - Home gardening in
            <scp>sub‐Saharan</scp>
            Africa: A scoping review on practices and nutrition outcomes in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya
PY  - 2022
AB  - Home gardening is promoted as an adaptation strategy to ameliorate the increasing food insecurity from climate change impacts among subsistence farming families in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, the geographic distribution of home gardens, their setup, management, and the effects on nutrition outcomes have not been fully described. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize recent evidence on home gardening for two exemplar countries: Burkina Faso and Kenya. Between June and August 2020, we searched, screened, and extracted evidence about home garden projects in both countries, following the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. Peer-reviewed scientific publications, and gray literature in English and French that reported about subsistence horticulture in rural settings of Burkina Faso or Kenya were included. The characteristics of the documents and the data pertaining to our research objectives were extracted into predefined spreadsheets. The data were synthesized in the form of a narrative review. Our search yielded 949 documents, of which 20 documents were included in the synthesis (Burkina Faso: 8, Kenya: 12). While the gardens varied in composition and size, the majority provided green leafy vegetables and indigenous horticultural crops. The challenges for successful home garden implementation comprised unfavorable climatic conditions, access to and affordability of inputs, water and land, and lack of know-how. We identified trends for improved food security, diet quality, and nutritional status among the target populations. This scoping review found that there is limited evidence on home garden practices in rural Burkina Faso and Kenya. To enhance the sustainability of home gardens, research and resources should be invested in codesigning context-specific home gardening projects. Pending rigorous impact evaluation, home gardens appear to be a promising tool for climate change adaptation while simultaneously improving food security and the nutritional situation among women and young children in these two exemplar countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - From an Empty-Plate Lunch to Silk-Stocking Dinner: Some Futuristic Approaches in Agriculture
PY  - 2021
AB  - Vicissitudes are an inevitable part of the developmental process. Agriculture, for eras, which has been known for its contribution to the livelihood of the human population over the world, is not an exception to this fact. The anthropogenic development happened in all other sectors of the global economy like population growth, industrialization, urbanization, changed preference in consumption pattern, climate changes, etc. created and accelerated many folded hurdles in the agriculture. These hurdles are conflicting production and consumption system, post-harvest losses, food wastage, food crisis, triple burden of malnutrition, etc. which need immediate action to maintain its sustainability. This chapter highlights the need and scope of futuristic approaches, including climate-smart agriculture, nutritional farming, nontraditional and urban farming, diversified agriculture, robotics in agriculture, ICT-led agriculture, post-production, post-harvest management, logistics and value chain development, surplus management, waste to wealth in agriculture, etc. The chapter also includes the policy options and its imperatives for farmer income-led agriculture, nutritional-sensitive agriculture and farming to reach the unfed population, etc. to conquer the emerging challenges in agriculture.

TI  - Nutrition integrated agricultural extension-a case study in Western Kenya.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Integrating nutrition communication in agricultural intervention programs aimed at increased food availability and accessibility in resource-poor areas is crucial. To enhance the sustainability and scalability of nutrition communication, the present study piloted the approach of 'nutrition integrated agricultural extension' and tested nutrition-related outcomes with two types of nutrition messages (specific vs. sensitive) and two delivery channels (public sector vs. private sector). The study intervention comprised (i) vegetable seed kit distribution, (ii) ongoing agricultural extension activities by public or private sectors and (iii) nutrition communication with two different messages. The intervention was tested with three treatment arms and reached 454 farmers (>65% female) in rural Kakamega County, Western Kenya. Pre-/post-surveys measured outcome variables focused on farmers' nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes and practices in vegetable production and consumption, and household dietary diversity score. Results showed that all treatments increased nutrition knowledge (p < 0.05). Nutrition-specific communication was more effective than nutrition-sensitive communication. Nutrition communication through either the public or the private agricultural sector was both effective. Before the study intervention, many participants believed that vegetable consumption was beneficial and wanted to increase intake. After the intervention, the number of participants who felt eating more vegetables was challenging decreased slightly. Nutrition communication was found to be especially important in conveying recommended food amounts and promoting increased vegetable consumption. Seasonality affected on-farm crop diversity and vegetable consumption results in this study.

TI  - Orange Fanta versus orange fruit: A novel measure of nutrition knowledge in Malawi.
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper introduces a novel survey instrument to identify distinct components of nutrition knowledge and test for links between knowledge and dietary choices in Southern Malawi. Our first aim is to distinguish respondents' familiarity with recommended behaviours, such as when to start breastfeeding or introduce solid foods, from respondents' factual knowledge about mechanisms, such as whether biscuits or papaya and orange fruit or orange Fanta contribute more to future health. We find knowledge of nutrition behaviours to be strongly associated with more schooling, older age, and being female, whereas knowledge of mechanisms is associated only with training and employment as a health professional. We then test whether this expanded definition of nutrition knowledge is associated with dietary intake when controlling for other factors and find no significant links in these data. Results point to the need for knowledge surveys and public health behaviour-change campaigns to address the kinds of information that might have the most influence on actual behaviour, potentially including the mechanisms involved in food composition, food safety, and disease transmission.

TI  - Tracing the Single and Combined Contributions of Home-Grown Supply and Health Literacy on Fruit and Vegetable Consumption: An Empirical Exploration in Rural India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Low fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC) remains a global health challenge. Fostering subsistence agriculture through the production and home-grown consumption (HGC) of fruits and vegetables are seen as potential strategies for improving overall FVC, in particular, for developing countries like India. In addition, educational strategies targeting FVC health literacy are also used. Little evidence has documented a connection between these two strategies. We examine the single and combined influence of HGC and health literacy with regard to benefits from fruits and vegetable consumption. Data were collected from 427 rural households in the state of Odisha, India. Three outcomes were examined: FVC, as well as fruit and vegetables separately. Linear and Poisson regression were used to examine the association among home-grown consumption (HGC), FVC health literacy, and the FVC outcomes. Findings show that HGC, but not FVC health literacy, was directly associated with FVC (β = 0.65, SE = 0.10, p = 0.008) and vegetable consumption (β = 0.57, SE = 0.11, p = 0.02). However, both HGC (β = 0.58, SE = 0.05, p < 0.01) and FVC health literacy (β = -0.07, SE = 0.02, p = 0.001) were associated with fruit consumption. In addition, HGC effect is concentrated among participants who reported low FVC health literacy, especially on overall FVC and vegetables alone. Results are discussed in relation to the beneficial role played by HGC in those particularly vulnerable households who perceived little FVC health literacy. Our results provide insights on novel improved FVC consumption across all population segments. Future research should explore the complex interplay between agricultural policies and educational programs in the design of interventions promoting fruit and vegetable production and consumption.

TI  - The role of chicken management practices in children's exposure to environmental contamination: a mixed-methods analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Household chicken production presents an opportunity to promote child nutrition, but the benefits might be offset by increased environmental contamination. Using household surveys, direct observations, and in-depth interviews with woman caregivers, we sought to describe the relationship between chicken management practices and household exposure to environmental contamination, and assess barriers to adopting improved husbandry practices. First, we analyzed baseline data from 973 households raising chickens in the two interventions arms from the Agriculture-to-Nutrition (ATONU) study in Ethiopia to assess the relationship between animal management practices and environmental exposures. Second, we conducted six-hour direct observations of children’s environmental exposures in 18 households. Among these households, we analyzed in-depth interviews with child caregivers. Quantitative analyses showed that households raised approximately 11 chickens, had animal feces visible on the property 67% of the time, and children’s hands were visibly dirty 38% of the time. Households with more chickens had lower exposure to animal feces. Having a chicken coop increased the risk of observing animal feces on the property by 30%, but among those with a coop, having an enclosed coop reduced that risk by 83%. Coops that were enclosed, had fencing, and were located further from homes were associated with a reduced risk of observing animal feces and an increased likelihood of children having clean hands. Direct observations showed that chicken coops were often poorly designed or not used. On average, 3 to 5 chickens were inside homes at a time, and livestock and domestic animals were frequently inside of houses and interacting with young children. In-depth interviews revealed that protection of animals, maintenance of household cleanliness and health, type of chicken (local versus improved) and resource constraints influenced management decisions. Improvements in chicken management practices could mitigate the exposure of household members to environmental contamination. Our findings highlight the need for training and resources to promote safe animal husbandry practices and optimal child health in nutrition-sensitive livestock projects. Clinical trials number: NCT03152227 ; Retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on May 12, 2012.

TI  - The “Fill the Nutrient Gap” analysis: An approach to strengthen nutrition situation analysis and decision making towards multisectoral policies and systems change
PY  - 2019
AB  - Improved nutrition situation analysis can increase the understanding of the likely magnitude and main causes of the nutrient gap among a particular target group, for example, children under 2 or pregnant and lactating women, in a particular context. The World Food Programme, with input from University of California Davis, International Food Policy Research Institute, Epicentre, Harvard University, Mahidol University, Save the Children, and UNICEF, has developed a framework for strengthened nutrition situation analysis and decision making called the "Fill the Nutrient Gap" (FNG), which aims to support identification of strategies to increase availability, access, and choice of nutritious foods, to ultimately improve nutrient intake. The FNG engages stakeholders from different sectors throughout the analytical process to provide input and discuss findings to collectively identify and prioritize context-specific strategies. The FNG analysis contributes to better understanding the nutrition situation because it (a) focuses on the dietary intake side of the malnutrition framework and analyses in-depth the nutrient intake of different target groups; (b) linear programming is used in combination with review of secondary data to characterize barriers to nutrient intake, in particular to understand the availability, cost and affordability of nutritious diets for households and target groups with higher nutritional needs, and model potential interventions to improve them; (c) it links the nutrition situation analysis to decision making by providing an evidence base for decision makers to inform their strategies; (d) it facilitates multisectoral discussion on barriers to nutrient intake and enables a prioritization of context-specific strategies (both nutrition specific and sensitive) to improve the nutrition situation across food, health, and social protection systems.

TI  - Food intake among smallholder cassava value chain households
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare food consumption and dietary diversity in smallholder cassava value chain households (CVCHs) and non-cassava value chain households (non-CVCHs).,A total of 572 rural households were selected using multi-stage sampling from Oyo and Kwara states, Southwest Nigeria. Socio-demographic, 24 h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires were used to collect data. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of Reproductive Age (MDD-W) were measured.,The mean age of respondents was 49.1 ± 17.3 years, 68.3 per cent were female, household sizes ranged from 2-20 with an average of 8 members. Most households consumed monotonous staple-based diets mainly from roots and tubers, cereals and legumes. There was no significant difference in HDDS (6.70 ± 1.37 and 6.77 ± 1.12; p = 0.12) and MDD-W (4.78 ± 1.12 and 4.95 ± 1.16; p = 0.09) for CVCH and non-CVCH respectively. About one-third of all women did not achieve the MDD-W score required for micronutrient adequacy, with the main dietary gap being vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables.,The findings suggest that there was no influence of households’ involvement in cassava value chain activities on their pattern of food consumption and dietary diversity.,While cassava value chain activities have potential for improved livelihoods among its actors, a nutrition-sensitive approach needs to be incorporated to translate this into their improved food consumption, dietary diversity and nutritional (particularly micronutrient) status.

TI  - Farm-level production diversity and child and adolescent nutrition in rural sub-Saharan Africa: a multicountry, longitudinal study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Child malnutrition remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural areas where many households are involved in subsistence farming. Increasing farm-level production diversity (FPD) is often considered a useful strategy to improve child diets and nutrition, but the empirical evidence is mixed. Most studies have investigated associations between FPD and dietary diversity. We therefore aimed to analyse associations between FPD and child and adolescent nutritional status.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS">In this multicountry, longitudinal study, we used representative panel data from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) to test the hypothesis that higher FPD is positively associated with child and adolescent nutritional status. The data were from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture collected between 2008 and 2019. We included data from all children and adolescents aged 0-18 years with available anthropometric data who were living in households involved in farming activities for home consumption, market sales, or both. FPD was measured in terms of the number of different crop and livestock species and food groups produced on each farm. Child and adolescent nutritional status was measured in terms of height-for-age Z scores (HAZ). We estimated panel data regression models with correlated random effects to control for confounding factors and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="FINDINGS">The total sample size included 50 689 child and adolescent observations. In combined models, with data from all countries included, we found one additional species produced on the farm (crop and livestock combined) was associated with a mean 0·015 SD greater child or adolescent HAZ (p&lt;0·0001). The role of FPD tended to decrease with better market access (in more remote locations mean 0·020 SD [p&lt;0·0001] and in less remote locations mean 0·008 SD [p=0·091]). In individual-country models, the effects were smaller and statistically insignificant in three of the four countries. Livestock diversity had larger positive associations with HAZ than crop diversity (livestock diversity effect on HAZ mean 0·085 SD [p&lt;0·0001] and crop diversity effect on HAZ mean 0·007 SD [p=0·080]). In Tanzania and Uganda, higher crop diversity was negatively associated with child and adolescent HAZ.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="INTERPRETATION">Our findings suggest that further farm-level diversification is not a suitable general strategy to improve child and adolescent nutrition but might be useful in some situations. Livestock production seems to be conducive for improving child and adolescent nutrition on average. Context-specific approaches need to be developed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="FUNDING">None.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Volunteer Community Health and Agriculture Workers Help Reduce Childhood Malnutrition in Tajikistan.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Childhood malnutrition is a nationally-recognized problem in Tajikistan. In 2017, 6% of children under 5 years were wasted and 18% were stunted. Through the Tajikistan Health and Nutrition Activity (THNA), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Feed the Future, IntraHealth International trained 1,370 volunteer community health workers (CHWs) and 500 community agricultural workers (CAWs) in 500 rural communities to improve nutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. CHWs and CAWs mutually encourage health behavior change, reinforce better agricultural practices, and promote maternal and child health and nutritious diets through household visits, community events, and peer support groups. CHWs refer children with malnutrition and diarrhea and pregnant women who are not registered for antenatal care to health facilities. THNA supported CHWs/CAWs through peer learning, refresher trainings, supportive supervision, and quarterly material incentives. We observed gains in knowledge, attitudes, and practices across health; nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture in target communities. From 2016 to 2019, we observed statistically significant (P<.05) improvements in children receiving a minimum acceptable diet; children with diarrhea receiving more liquids; women making 4 or more antenatal care visits; women reporting improved WASH; and farmers demonstrating improved agricultural practices. A February 2020 screening of 94.6% of children under 5 years in target communities found the prevalence of children with signs of wasting at 2.2%. Partnerships between CHWs, CAWs, and rural health workers facilitated these results. Paired agricultural and health interventions proved successful in improving nutrition of children and may be applicable in other contexts. Although effective in delivering interventions, CHWs/CAWs experience attrition, need motivation, and require intensive support. Assuming responsibility for this community-based volunteer workforce presents a major challenge for Tajikistan's national and local governments.

TI  - Integrating nutrition outcomes into agriculture development for impact at scale: Highlights from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Canadian International Food Security Research Fund programme supported research and scaling up of nutrition- and gender-sensitive agriculture innovations from 2009 to 2018. Women and girls were identified as agents of change and were targeted as the main programme beneficiaries. Projects were implemented in 25 countries through multistakeholder partnerships among universities, research institutions, public and private sectors, and civil society groups, reaching over 78 million people, mainly women and children. Approaches specific to nutrition included growing more nutritious crops, improving dietary diversity, value added processing, food fortification, and nutrition education. Scale-up for impact was achieved through a number of pathways that started with evidence through rigorous research, followed by a combination of elements such as understanding local and regional contexts to identify specific bottlenecks and opportunities for the deployment and adoption of successful innovations, selecting politically effective or influential partners to lead the scaling up process, and investing in long-term local capacity and leadership building. Overall, the knowledge generated in the programme indicate that well-designed nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food-based interventions can have meaningful impacts on pathways that will lead to better health and well-being of women and children through improving household and individual access to nutrient-rich foods. Longer intervention times are needed to demonstrate changes in health indicators such as reduced stunting. This overview paper summarises the programme and showcases examples from studies that demonstrate the impact pathway for nutrition interventions that encompass efficacy and effectiveness studies, value-added processing, cost effectiveness of interventions, and bringing a proven intervention to scale.

TI  - The importance of the traditional milpa in food security and nutritional self-sufficiency in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Around 30% of global food is produced by smallholder farmers, yet they constitute the most food-insecure group. In Mexico, food self-sufficiency is declining. Rural policies in the country have stimulated the production of cash crops to the detriment of the traditional intercropping system, the milpa. Such a decline may have negative consequences for the food security of subsistence farmers. This study aimed to assess changes in nutritional self-sufficiency over the last 30 years and the role of milpa systems in food security for two communities in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. The study used satellite images, censuses, and field data to estimate food production. Three cropping systems, monoculture of maize, monoculture of common bean, and the milpa were compared in terms of nutrients and vitamins produced. Furthermore, a household typology was developed for each community to contrast nutritional self-sufficiency levels between the different household types. Results showed that the milpa produced more volume of food per area compared to the other systems. The milpa also produced all the nutrients and vitamins (except for B12) required to feed at least 2 persons ha-1. Monocultures of maize lacked vitamins A, B9, B12, and C, and the common bean lacked vitamins A, B12, and C. While farmers recognized the importance of the milpa, they preferred monocultures due to the reduced labor demands of this system. Households that obtained most of their income from off-farm activities had the lowest nutritional self-sufficiency. Enhancing nutritional self-sufficiency through crop diversification has the potential to not only improve the nutrition of subsistence farmers, but also to enhance ecosystem service provision, promote biodiversity conservation and restoration, and improve resilience to climate change.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of integrated development: are we asking the right questions? A systematic review.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Emerging global transformations - including a new Sustainable Development Agenda - are revealing increasingly interrelated goals and challenges, poised to be addressed by similarly integrated, multi-faceted solutions. Research to date has focused on determining the effectiveness of these approaches, yet a key question remains: are synergistic effects produced by integrating two or more sectors? We systematically reviewed impact evaluations on integrated development interventions to assess whether synergistic, amplified impacts are being measured and evaluated. Methods: The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation's (3ie) Impact Evaluation Repository comprised our sampling frame (n = 4,339). Following PRISMA guidelines, we employed a three-stage screening and review process. Results: We identified 601 journal articles that evaluated integrated interventions. Seventy percent used a randomized design to assess impact with regard to whether the intervention achieved its desired outcomes. Only 26 of these evaluations, however, used a full factorial design to statistically detect any synergistic effects produced by integrating sectors. Of those, seven showed synergistic effects. Conclusions: To date, evaluations of integrated development approaches have demonstrated positive impacts in numerous contexts, but gaps remain with regard to documenting whether integrated programming produces synergistic, amplified outcomes. Research on these program models needs to extend beyond impact only, and more explicitly examine and measure the synergies and efficiencies associated with linking two or more sectors. Doing so will be critical for identifying effective integrated development strategies that will help achieve the multi-sector SDG agenda.

TI  - Maternal Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Complementary Feeding and Child Undernutrition in the Vakinankaratra Region of Madagascar: A Mixed-Methods Study.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Data are limited on how feeding knowledge and practices relate to child undernutrition in the highlands of Madagascar. Objectives This study assessed maternal knowledge and practices of complementary feeding and their associations with anthropometrics of children aged 6-23 mo in the Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar. Methods Knowledge was assessed using WHO recommendations on child feeding, and WHO infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicators were used to evaluate feeding practices. Child growth was measured as length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores using the 2006 WHO growth standards. A z-score less than -2 was classified as child undernutrition. Logistic regression models were used to determine associations between independent variables and outcomes. Focus group discussions among mothers and in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted; barriers and facilitators of optimal feeding practices were identified using a thematic analysis approach. Results Maternal knowledge scores regarding child feeding averaged 6.4 of 11. Better knowledge scores were associated with higher odds of appropriate complementary feeding practices before and after covariate adjustments. The proportions of children achieving the minimum dietary diversity (35.8%), minimum acceptable diet (30.2%), and consuming meat, fish, and poultry (14.1%) were low. Only consumption of iron-rich foods was associated with lower odds of underweight (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.7; P < 0.05). None of the IYCF indicators were associated significantly with stunting or wasting. Maternal attitudes about complementary foods, as well as mothers' workload and very low income, were identified as barriers to optimal feeding practices. Maternal perceived benefits of giving appropriate complementary foods as well as their positive relationship with the community health workers were the main facilitators of optimal child feeding. Conclusions Integrated nutrition-sensitive interventions addressing these barriers while enhancing the facilitators are critical in promoting better feeding practices in the Vakinankaratra region.

TI  - Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables Among Individuals 15 Years and Older in 28 Low- and Middle-Income Countries.
PY  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND The WHO recommends 400 g/d of fruits and vegetables (the equivalent of ∼5 servings/d) for the prevention of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). However, there is limited evidence regarding individual-level correlates of meeting these recommendations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In order to target policies and interventions aimed at improving intake, global monitoring of fruit and vegetable consumption by socio-demographic subpopulations is required. OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to 1) assess the proportion of individuals meeting the WHO recommendation and 2) evaluate socio-demographic predictors (age, sex, and educational attainment) of meeting the WHO recommendation. METHODS Data were collected from 193,606 individuals aged ≥15 y in 28 LMICs between 2005 and 2016. The prevalence of meeting the WHO recommendation took into account the complex survey designs, and countries were weighted according to their World Bank population estimates in 2015. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations with socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS The proportion (95% CI) of individuals aged ≥15 y who met the WHO recommendation was 18.0% (16.6-19.4%). Mean intake of fruits was 1.15 (1.10-1.20) servings per day and for vegetables, 2.46 (2.40-2.51) servings/d. The proportion of individuals meeting the recommendation increased with increasing country gross domestic product (GDP) class (P < 0.0001) and with decreasing country FAO food price index (FPI; indicating greater stability of food prices; P < 0.0001). At the individual level, those with secondary education or greater were more likely to achieve the recommendation compared with individuals with no formal education: risk ratio (95% CI), 1.61 (1.24-2.09). CONCLUSIONS Over 80% of individuals aged ≥15 y living in these 28 LMICs consumed lower amounts of fruits and vegetables than recommended by the WHO. Policies to promote fruit and vegetable consumption in LMICs are urgently needed to address the observed inequities in intake and prevent NCDs.

TI  - Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospects for the Future
PY  - 2020
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting food and nutrition security and requires urgent attention from policymakers Sustainable intensification of agriculture is one strategy that attempts to increase food production without adversely impacting the environment, by shifting from water-intensive crops to other climate-resistant and nutritious crops This paper focuses on the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh by studying the impact of shifting 20% of the area under paddy and cotton cultivation to other crops like millets and pulses Using FAO’s CROPWAT model, along with monsoon forecasts and detailed agricultural data, we simulate the crop water requirements across the study area We simulate a business-as-usual base case and compare it to multiple crop diversification strategies using various parameters—food, calories, protein production, as well as groundwater and energy consumption Results from this study indicate that reduced paddy cultivation decreases groundwater and energy consumption by around 9–10%, and a calorie deficit between 4 and 8%—making up this calorie deficit requires a 20–30% improvement in the yields of millets and pulses We also propose policy interventions to incentivize the cultivation of nutritious and climate-resistant crops as a sustainable strategy towards strengthening food and nutrition security while lowering the environmental footprint of food production

TI  - Multi-criteria clustering analytics for agro-based perishables in cold-chain
PY  - 2019
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to determine compatibility groups of different fruits and vegetables that can be stored and transported together based upon their requirements for temperature, relative humidity, odour and ethylene production. Pre-cooling which is necessary to prepare the commodity for subsequent shipping and safe storage is also discussed.,The methodology used in this journal is an attempt to form clusters/groups of storing together 43 identified fruits and vegetables based on four important parameters, namely, temperature, relative humidity, odour and ethylene production. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to build a cluster hierarchy that is commonly displayed as a tree diagram called dendrogram. The same is further analyzed using K-means clustering to find clusters of comparable spatial extent. The results obtained from the analytics are compared with the available data of grouping fruits and vegetables.,This study investigates the usefulness and efficacy of the proposed clustering approach for storage and transportation of different fruits and vegetables that will eventually save huge investment made in terms of developing infrastructure components and energy consumption. This will enable the investors to adopt it for using the space more effectively and also reducing food wastage.,Due to limited research and development (R&D) data pertaining to storage parameters of different fruits and vegetables on the basis of temperature, relative humidity, ethylene production/sensitivity, odour and pre-cooling, information from different available sources have been utilized. India needs to develop its own crop specific R&D data, since the conditions for soil, water and environment vary when compared to other countries. Due to the limited availability of the research data, various multi-criteria approaches used in other areas have been applied to this paper. Future studies might be interested in considering other relevant variables depending upon R&D and data availability.,With the increase in population, the demand for food is also increasing. To meet such growing demand and provide quality and nutritional food, it is important to have a clear methodology in terms of compatibility grouping for utilizing the available storage space for multi-commodity produce and during transportation. The methodology used shall enable the practitioners to understand the importance of temperature, humidity, odour and ethylene sensitivity for storage and transportation of perishables.,This approach shall be useful for decision making by farmers, Farmer Producer Organization, cold-storage owners, practicing managers, policy makers and researchers in the areas of cold-chain management and will provide an opportunity to use the available space in the cold storage for storing different fruits and vegetables, thereby facilitating optimum use of infrastructure and resources. This will enable the investors to utilize the space more effectively and also reduce food wastage. It shall also facilitate organizations to manage their logistic activities to gain competitive advantage.,The proposed model would help decision makers to resolve the issues related to the selection of storing different perishable commodities together. From the secondary research, not much research papers have been found where such a multi-criteria clustering approach has been applied for the storage of fruits and vegetables incorporating four important parameters relevant for storage and transportation.

TI  - Can household dietary diversity inform about nutrient adequacy? Lessons from a food systems analysis in Ethiopia
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study examined the use of the household dietary diversity score (HDDS) to assess household nutrient adequacy in Ethiopia. It also examined the correlates of HDDS following the food systems framework. Results show that the average nutrient consumption in Ethiopia varies by place of residence and by income profile, where households in urban areas and those in the higher income quintiles rank favorably. Among 13 nutrients under study, we found nutrient inadequacy for fat, calcium, zinc, riboflavin, niacin, folate, vitamin C and vitamin A ranging between 46% and 89%, and the prevalence of inadequacy for vitamin B12 to be up to 100%. Econometric results showed that HDDS is a strong predictor of a household’s mean probability of nutrient adequacy (MPA), and that an HDDS of 10 is the minimum threshold at which HDDS can improve household MPA. We found suggestive evidence within the food systems that improving household-incomes, access to health and transport services are beneficial to improve HDDS and nutrient consumption in Ethiopia.

TI  - Value Chains and Diet Quality: A Review of Impact Pathways and Intervention Strategies
PY  - 2019
AB  - Low and middle-income countries increasingly face a triple burden of malnutrition encompassing undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, and excessive energy consumption contributing to overweight and obesity. Food systems are also becoming more complex, supported by investments in food processing and retailing. Traditional approaches addressing hunger, typically based on agricultural development, are deemed insufficient alone to address the problem and attention is now being directed to food value chains, although experience is currently limited. To assess the state of science and identify knowledge gaps, an integrative review of the broad topic of value chains and diet quality was undertaken, with particular focus on interventions and their related impact pathways. Interventions were classified according to their primary orientation: to increase the availability, accessibility, or desirability of nutritious food. We identified 24 separate interventions associated with 10 different impact pathways, demonstrating the numerous entry points and large potential for value chain interventions to influence diet quality. However, case study evidence regarding effectiveness remains scant. Most studies addressed individual nutrient-rich commodities that could address a nutritional deficiency in the community of interest. Rarely was overall diet quality assessed, and future studies could benefit from taking a wider perspective of dietary patterns and food substitutions. The value chain analytical approach was deemed valuable due to its consumer orientation that seeks to understand how food products are used and what motivates their choice. The systems perspective is also important as it considers the roles of actors involved in food production, distribution, marketing, and regulation. However, few studies directly engaged with the subject of the local food environment as the bridge connecting food production and food choice. The challenge is to combat the increasing prevalence of processed foods of low nutritional value through interventions that lead to nutritious food becoming more conveniently available, affordable, and desirable.

TI  - Contribution of Fruits and Vegetables to the Household Food Security Situation of Rural Households in Limpopo.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Food insecurity continues to be a burden for many South Africans. The production and consumption of fruits and vegetables have a potential role in improving household food security and are considered one of the critical pathways for reducing food insecurity and malnutrition levels in the country. This paper set out to determine the effect of fruits and vegetables on the food security status of rural households in the Limpopo province. Data (secondary) for this study were collected from 2043 respondents who were selected through stratified random selection based on the population size of the district municipalities in Limpopo. This study used a quantitative research approach, and data were analyzed using a descriptive analysis, the household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS), and a Poisson regression model with an endogenous treatment model. The findings revealed that gender and involvement in agricultural production had a positive significant relationship with the consumption of fruits and vegetables, while disability grants had a negative impact. Age, household size, and receiving a disability grant had a positive significant impact on determining the household food insecurity status; however, gender had a negative significant relationship. This study concluded that the consumption of fruits and vegetables considerably influenced the food security status of the household. There is a need for government officials and local leaders to provide food security interventions that prioritize women and elders. These may include promoting household production and consumption of diversified fruits and vegetables.

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions in mountain areas-Lessons learned from a 5-country project to upscale best practices
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many people living in mountain regions in lowand middle-income countries are vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, which contributes to poor nutritional status. Food and nutrition security require stability of access to affordable, safe, diverse, and nutritious foods. In mountainous areas, affordability and access to diverse foods are challenged by climatic factors constraining agricultural production, poor infrastructure, and geographic isolation. This article describes a nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) project focusing on 5 countries—Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Peru— where 132 microinterventions were implemented by rural service providers (RSPs) who received training and technical support from the project. These microinterventions serve as learning cases for advocacy work to promote the NSA approach at the local, national, and global levels. They are also documented on an Internet platform allowing RSPs and other stakeholders to share best practices and lessons learned at the national and global levels. Preliminary results indicate that this approach is highly effective in addressing nutrition and livelihood issues in remote mountain areas. To scale up the approach and boost its integration into policies at the local, national, and global levels, 2 aspects will be critical. First, more systemic and integrated NSA initiatives need to be implemented that functionally combine production- and consumption-related aspects to effectively change nutrition behavior and serve as learning cases for scaling up. Second, effective capacity development of RSPs and encouragement of interaction among them is key to empowering them as change agents.

TI  - Market food diversity mitigates the effect of environment on women's dietary diversity in the Agriculture to Nutrition (ATONU) study, Ethiopia.
PY  - 2019
AB  - OBJECTIVE In Ethiopia, women's dietary diversity is low, primarily due to poor food availability and access, both at home and market level. The present study aimed to describe market access using a new definition called market food diversity (MFD) and estimate the impact of MFD, crop and livestock diversity on dietary diversity among women enrolled in the Agriculture to Nutrition (ATONU) trial. DESIGN Baseline cross-sectional data collected from November 2016 to January 2017 were used for the analysis. Availability of foods in markets was assessed at the village level and categorized into nine food groups similar to the dietary diversity index for women. Bivariate and multivariate mixed-effects regression analyses were conducted, adjusted for clustering at the village level. SETTING Chicken-producing farmers in rural Ethiopia.ParticipantsWomen (n 2117) aged 15-49 years. RESULTS Overall, less than 6 % of women met the minimum dietary diversity (≥5 food groups) and the most commonly consumed food groups were staples and legumes. Median MFD was 4 food groups (interquartile range: 2-8). Multivariate models indicated that women's dietary diversity differed by livestock diversity, food crop diversity and agroecology, with significant interaction effects between agroecology and MFD. CONCLUSIONS Women's dietary diversity is poor in Ethiopia. Local markets are variable in food availability across seasons and agroecological zones. The MFD indicator captures this variability, and women who have access to higher MFD in the highland agroecological zone have better dietary diversity. Thus, MFD has the potential to mitigate the effects of environment on women's dietary diversity.

TI  - Using a Community-Based Early Childhood Development Center as a Platform to Promote Production and Consumption Diversity Increases Children's Dietary Intake and Reduces Stunting in Malawi: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background Children in Malawi face nutritional risks related to low-quality diets and chronic malnutrition. Objective This study evaluated the impact of a 1-y early childhood development (ECD) center-based agriculture and nutrition intervention aimed at improving household production diversity, maternal knowledge on child nutrition and feeding practices, and children's diets and anthropometric measures. Methods A longitudinal cluster-randomized controlled trial was implemented in 60 community-based childcare centers (CBCCs), covering 1248 preschool children (aged 36-72 mo) and 304 younger siblings (aged 6-24 mo). CBCCs were randomly assigned to 1) a control group providing the Save the Children's ECD program or 2) a treatment group providing a standard ECD program with additional activities to improve nutritious food production and behavior change communication to improve diets and care practices for young children. Primary outcomes were household production and production diversity, preschooler enrollment and attendance, and dietary intake measured by quantitative 24-h recall and minimum diet diversity for younger siblings. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures for preschoolers and younger siblings, child development scores for preschoolers, and women's asset ownership and time use (the latter 2 are not discussed in this article). We used difference-in-difference (DID) estimates to assess impacts. Results Compared with the control group, preschool children in the intervention group had greater increases in nutrient intakes and in dietary diversity. No impacts on anthropometric measures were seen in preschoolers. Younger siblings in the intervention group had greater increases in height-for-age z scores than did children in the control group (DID: 0.44; P < 0.05) and greater reductions in the prevalence of stunting (DID: -17 percentage points; P < 0.05). The plausibility of the impact on growth in younger siblings was supported by effects along program impact pathways, including production of nutritious foods, caregiver knowledge, and dietary diversity. Conclusion Implementing an integrated agriculture and nutrition intervention through an ECD platform benefited children's diets and reduced stunting among younger siblings of targeted preschoolers. This trial was registered on the ISRCTN registry as ISCRCTN96497560.

TI  - Leveraging agriculture for nutrition in South Asia: What do we know, and what have we learned?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Despite significant improvements over recent decades, rates of undernutrition remain high in South Asia, with adverse impacts on morbidity and mortality. Overweight/obesity, among children and adults, is now an additional and major public health concern. While agriculture has the potential to improve nutrition through several pathways, this potential is currently not being realised in the region. The Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research consortium (2012–2018) set out to improve understanding about how agriculture and related food policies and programs in South Asia (specifically in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan) can be better conceptualised and implemented in order to enhance impacts on nutrition outcomes, especially those of young children and adolescent girls. This paper provides a snapshot of the agriculture-nutrition nexus in the region, outlines the pathways through which agriculture can influence nutrition outcomes, elaborates on the objectives of the LANSA research consortium within this context, and highlights the core findings of the six papers that form the body of this Special Issue. The paper ends with five key lessons that have emerged from this research, during this decade.

TI  - Making livestock research and programming more nutrition sensitive
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Global efforts such as the Sustainable Development Goals recognize and underscore the significant role that human nutrition has on individual health and population-level development. Consequently, interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder groups, such as the Global Alliance for Improving Nutrition and the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement, have been established to reduce under-nutrition, particularly in children and pregnant women. The concept of nutrition-sensitive agriculture has grown significantly in recent years, and the evidence indicates that integration of nutritional outcomes into agriculture programs has allowed these efforts to make important contributions to the reduction of malnutrition. However, when considering livestock as a subset of agricultural research and programming, nutritional objectives have been less effectively integrated into research and programming. The repercussions of this missed opportunity are exacerbated by the unique nutritional value of animal source foods (ASF) and its potential to increase dietary diversity and improve nutrition and health. Through a set of expert interviews with researchers and development practitioners in the areas of livestock and/or human nutrition, this article identifies factors that make livestock research and programs nutrition-sensitive and factors associated with livestock research/programs that fail to be nutrition-sensitive. Results indicate that an overly narrow focus on nutritional indicators, such as stunting, and target population (children) have hindered the uptake of nutrition-sensitive approaches. Experts indicate that interdisciplinary teams, longer and more iterative funding cycles, and integration of behavior change are elements livestock programs that successfully integrate nutrition. Implications of these and other findings for donors, researchers, and practitioners are presented.

TI  - Labeling Nutrition-Sensitive Food Chains: A Consumer Preference Analysis of Milk Products.
PY  - 2020
AB  - While nutrition-sensitive value-chain approaches are strongly advocated, studies on consumer preferences for such interventions are lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by examining a nutrition-sensitive chain labeling scheme, using the Ugandan dairy sector as a case. A survey was conducted among 250 consumers, primarily eliciting perceptions of the importance of a nutrition-sensitive chain label compared to nutrition claims/facts. In addition, a choice-based conjoint experiment was designed with nutrition label, brand, fat content, and price as attributes. Findings show that nutrition-sensitive chain labeling was more positively perceived by consumers than by nutrition claims/facts. Ordered logistic regression analysis indicated that BMI, nutrition knowledge, and label use influenced consumers' perceived importance of a nutrition-sensitive chain label relative to sex, age, children, and milk purchase frequency for nutrition claims/facts. This is confirmed by the higher utilities for the nutrition-sensitive chain label in our conjoint experiment. Future research should focus on the integration of nutrition-sensitive chain labeling with existing labels in a way that promotes candid interpretation by consumers. Industrial and policy actors in the agri-food sector can use these findings to innovate and regulate appropriate labeling schemes in the context of nutrition-sensitive value chains.

TI  - Sustainable livestock systems to improve human health, nutrition, and economic status
PY  - 2019
AB  - The most common words associated with sustainability are “environment,” “social,” and “economic.” Thus, sustainability is a holistic concept that jointly considers ecological, social, and economic dimensions of a system or intervention for long-lasting prosperity. Experience shows that economic development at the cost of ecology does not last; therefore, it is critical to harmonize ecology with development. This also applies to livestock systems, which should be economically viable for farmers, environmentally friendly or at least neutral, and socially acceptable in order to be considered sustainable. There are different types of livestock production systems, depending on availability of resources, environmental conditions, and social and economic contexts, and they vary considerably in sustainability. These livestock systems include the grassland-based extensive systems, intensive landless systems, and mixed farming systems among others. These systems contribute significantly to human nutrition and livelihoods and provide important ecosystem services. However, if not properly managed, they can also cause nutrient and environmental pollution and land degradation. With increasing global awareness about climate change and studies indicating that livestock is one of the contributors to greenhouse gases, environmental degradation, and loss of biodiversity, various concerted efforts have been aimed at developing and or ensuring the sustainability of livestock systems that deliver economic and ecosystems services without compromising the future integrity, health, and welfare of the environment, humans, and animals. Increasing competition for the requisite resources for feed and food production, especially under more intensive livestock production systems, has raised concerns about the economic and environmental sustainability of some livestock production systems. Feed production and processing, and enteric fermentation of feed contribute to 45% and 39%, respectively, of the total emissions from agriculture (Steinfeld et al., 2006). About 90% of livestock emissions are produced by ruminants through enteric fermentation (188 million tons) and the remaining 10% from manure (Swamy and Bhattacharya, 2006). In addition, inadequately managed livestock production systems may cause negative environmental consequences such as eutrophication in intensive high input systems, overgrazing, and soil and rangeland degradation in extensive systems and negative human health outcomes. Even though inadequately managed livestock systems may have adverse effects on the environment, widely quoted statistics about their contribution are misleading. Most do not reflect the diversity of livestock production systems nor differences between production systems dominant in various countries even for a given species. For instance, an often-cited statistic is that livestock contribute 18% of greenhouse gases globally (Steinfeld et al., 2006), more than that for the transportation industry, but that analysis is incorrect and has been corrected by the authors (Mottet and Steinfeld, 2018). Moreover, interventions can help reduce the carbon footprint of livestock production, while improving productivity. For example, with improved management and feeding strategies, the carbon footprint per billion kilograms of beef produced in 2007 was reduced by 16.3% compared with equivalent beef production in 1977 (Capper, 2011). When comparing greenhouse gas emissions of various livestock production systems, it is critical to take the need for environmental stewardship as well as food security into account to ensure the sustainability of the system. An index which takes both into account is the emissions intensity measure, which relates greenhouse gas emissions to food produced by the system. This important index shows that methane production per unit of food produced in several low- and middle-income countries is much greater than in some developed countries (Figure 1). This does not imply that the production systems in the developed countries should be copied entirely by low- and middle-income countries; rather, each country should evaluate and implement the aspects of developed country production systems that will sustainably intensify their production systems and thereby increase food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Home gardening improves dietary diversity, a cluster-randomized controlled trial among Tanzanian women.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Homestead food production (HFP) programmes improve the availability of vegetables by providing training in growing nutrient-dense crops. In rural Tanzania, most foods consumed are carbohydrate-rich staples with low micronutrient concentrations. This cluster-randomized controlled trial investigated whether women growing home gardens have higher dietary diversity, household food security or probability of consuming nutrient-rich food groups than women in a control group. We enrolled 1,006 women of reproductive age in 10 villages in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania, split between intervention (INT) and control (CON) groups. INT received (a) agricultural training and inputs to promote HFP and dietary diversity and (b) nutrition and public health counselling from agricultural extension workers and community health workers. CON received standard services provided by agriculture and health workers. Results were analysed using linear regression models with propensity weighting adjusting for individual-level confounders and differential loss to follow up. Women in INT consumed 0.50 (95% CI [0.20, 0.80], p = 0.001) more food groups per day than women in CON. Women in INT were also 14 percentage points (95% CI [6, 22], p = 0.001) more likely to consume at least five food groups per day, and INT households were 6 percentage points (95% CI [-13, 0], p = 0.059) less likely to experience moderate-to-severe food insecurity compared with CON. This home gardening intervention had positive effects on diet quality and food security after 1 year. Future research should explore whether impact is sustained over time as well as the effects of home garden interventions on additional measures of nutritional status.

TI  - Multisectoral nutrition planning in Nepal: Evidence from an organizational network analysis.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Multisectoral approaches are central to the global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal joined SUN in 2011 and approved the first 5-year Multisectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) in 2012, covering 2013-2017. This mixed methods study draws on organizational network analysis (ONA) and qualitative interviews with a sample of 22 organizations to examine (1) levels of engagement and network dynamics among government sectors and development organizations and (2) milestones and processes in the development and implementation of Nepal's MSNP. Findings suggest that the development of the MSNP was related to the high density of organizational connections; the leadership role of the Nepal's National Planning Commission and the National Nutrition and Food Security Secretariat; and the bridging roles played by a few government ministries and UN agencies that linked organizations that did not have direct relationships with each other. Specialized roles were observed for the three types of working relationships: policy dialogue, strategic planning and implementation. Partners were less connected on MSNP implementation than for policy dialogue and strategic planning, which may have constrained collaborative scale-up efforts. The Ministry of Agricultural Development, in particular, was the conduit for connecting non-health sectors into the broader network. Our study offers insights into the structure and dynamics of multisectoral planning in Nepal. It also contributes to a small but growing literature that illustrates how ONA can be applied to measure and use network results to elucidate the processes for strengthening multisectoral planning and implementation of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions.

TI  - Food tree species selection for nutrition‐sensitive forest landscape restoration in Burkina Faso
PY  - 2022
AB  - Modern food systems push agriculture to focus on a small number of commercial crops, while there is a very large diversity of untapped edible plants that could be used to address food security and nutrition. Poor and monotonous diets are closely linked to the complex burden of multiple forms of malnutrition and dietary risk. In some contexts, such as West Africa, micronutrient deficiency risks are particularly pronounced. Hence, there is an urgent need to provide people with healthy diets supported by sustainable food systems. Within this context, using nutrition-sensitive forest landscape restoration to combat environmental degradation could contribute towards ensuring the year-round availability of nutritious tree-based food. Les systèmes alimentaires modernes se fondent sur un nombre très limité de cultures commerciales, alors qu'une très grande diversité de plantes comestibles inexploitées pourrait assurer la sécurité alimentaire et la nutrition. Les régimes alimentaires appauvris et peu diversifiés sont étroitement liés aux multiples formes de malnutrition et aux risques alimentaires. Dans certains contextes, comme en Afrique de l'Ouest, les défaillances en micronutriments sont particulièrement prononcées. Par conséquent, il urge de développer des régimes alimentaires sains, soutenus par des systèmes alimentaires durables. Dans ce contexte, la restauration des paysages forestiers pour lutter contre la dégradation de l'environnement qui s'inscrit dans une approche sensible à la nutrition pourrait contribuer à assurer la disponibilité tout au long de l'année d'aliments nutritifs dérivés des arbres. Global diets connect human health and environmental sustainability but currently imperil both (Béné et al., 2019; Haddad et al., 2016; Steffen et al., 2015; Willett et al., 2019). Modern food systems push agriculture to focus on a small number of commercial crops (with rice, maize and wheat providing more than 50% of the calories consumed globally; Reeves et al., 2016), while there is a very large diversity of untapped edible plants that could be used to address food security and nutrition (more than 7000 edible plant species; Ulian et al., 2020). Thus, global diets are becoming more homogeneous, with a considerable decrease (69%) in variation between food supplies in different countries (Khoury et al., 2014). Diet quality is closely linked to the complex burden of multiple forms of malnutrition and dietary risk factors are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Poor diet quality contributes to stunting in children under 5 years, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight/obesity, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (Development Initiatives, 2017). According to recent estimates, around two billion people globally are affected by micronutrient deficiencies, also called “hidden hunger” (Bailey et al., 2015). In sub-Saharan Africa, micronutrient deficiencies are quite pronounced (Joy et al., 2014), particularly in Sahelian belt countries where critical wasting prevalence is concentrated (Local Burden of Disease Child Growth Failure Collaborators, 2020), and in rural populations (Green et al., 2016). Providing the global population with healthy diets supported by sustainable food systems is an urgent need. A diverse diet increases the likelihood of consuming adequate amounts of the full range of nutrients essential to human health (World Health Organization, 2003). Moreover, evidence shows that certain foods, most notably fruits and vegetables, contribute to the prevention of diet-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, which cannot be explained by adding up nutrients alone (Angelino et al., 2019; Boeing et al., 2012; Dauchet et al., 2009; Mozaffarian & Ludwig, 2010). Dietary guidelines around the world recommend a varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes for optimal health (Gonzalez Fischer & Garnett, 2016). Increasing their consumption increases the likelihood of consuming adequate amounts of the full range of nutrients essential to human health and protects against many forms of noncommunicable disease. Diet quality can be directly influenced by diversified livelihood strategies, such as agroforestry and harvesting of wild food tree products (Ruel et al., 2018). A rich diversity of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) offers opportunities for more sustainable food production and healthier diets (Borelli et al., 2020; Hunter et al., 2019; Meldrum & Padulosi, 2017; Padulosi et al., 2021). NUS are domesticated, semi-domesticated, or wild species and plant varieties that are marginalized or ignored by research, breeding programs, and policy-making. However, they often have a significant sociocultural value, as they are part of a common cultural heritage (Vasudeva et al., 2015). Indigenous people living within and nearby forests or other tree-based systems have strong cultural ties to forest foods (Chamberlain et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2009), and edible tree products are a subject of gendered knowledge and preferences (Gachuiri et al., 2022). The precise number of NUS that can help addressing issues of erosion of diversity in food systems and enhance nutritious food production is uncertain, but attempts have been made by Meldrum et al. (2018) to examine more than a thousand vegetable species that could be used to diversify agricultural systems for improved nutrition (Lachat et al., 2017), while major knowledge gaps remain for other NUS, such fruits, cereals, pulses, and roots and tubers (Hunter et al., 2019). Recent estimates indicate that there are more than 7000 edible plant species (Ulian et al., 2020). To assess the nutritional properties of such a large number of species would be a daunting task, although attempts have been made to use phylogenetic information targeting more than 6400 edible plants lacking nutritional data to identify plants with the greatest potential to support strategies alleviating B-vitamin deficiencies (Cantwell-Jones et al., 2022). Fruits and vegetables are good sources of micronutrients, and trees play an important role in the direct provision of nutritious foods, such as nuts, oils, vegetables (leaves, flowers, and roots), fruits, and berries (Jamnadass et al., 2015). The evidence that forests, trees, and agroforests provide essential nutrients has grown significantly in recent years (Fungo et al., 2016; Gitz et al., 2021; Ickowitz et al., 2021; Rasolofoson et al., 2018; Vinceti et al., 2013). In addition, there is growing awareness of the indirect role that forests, trees, and agroforestry systems play in food security and nutrition by supplying wood fuel for cooking and boiling water, by generating employment and income opportunities that enable purchasing food from other sources, and by providing ecosystem services that sustain food production and agricultural activities (Gitz et al., 2021). However, forest edible products tend to be unaccounted for in official statistics, given the informal nature of markets and consumption. In addition, trees tend to be largely neglected in nutrition-related interventions. In the face of worldwide increasing deforestation and forest degradation, global initiatives triggered by the Bonn Challenge have driven major efforts to mobilize stakeholders and funding to launch large-scale forest restoration, with a target of initiating the restoration of 350 million hectares by 2030 (Saint-Laurent et al., 2020). The resulting forest landscape restoration (FLR) efforts are an important opportunity to enhance the availability, access and use of food tree species (Jansen et al., 2020). In some contexts, such as West Africa, nutrition security is quite prominent among tree-based ecosystem services, given that many tree species supply edible products, among other non-timber forest products such as medicines (Hahn et al., 2018; Hahn et al., 2019; Zizka, Thiombiano, Dressler, Nacoulma, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, et al., 2015). Therefore, FLR projects in such regions and beyond must become nutrition-sensitive by promoting optimal tree combinations that ensure year-round availability of nutritious tree-based food. However, translating the concept of sustainable diets into action has proven to be very difficult, and the implementation of nutrition-sensitive restoration is likely to be no exception. Among critical obstacles are the limited availability of actionable, cross-sector data that can support location-specific actions, simultaneously addressing synergies and trade-off between health, economic, and environmental aspects of food systems. In particular, nutritional data on tree foods (e.g., content of vitamins, proteins, and minerals) do not lend themselves to direct use in practical applications, without proper translation into concrete recommendations. First, large gaps exist in the nutritional characterization of edible products from tree species. Second, nutritional values from different data sources can be highly variable and of inconsistent quality (see the systematic review conducted on a well-documented food tree species in West Africa, Parkia biglobosa, by Termote et al., 2022). Thus, the aggregation of existing nutritional data requires careful screening and harmonization (e.g., in terms of units of measurement, sampling, and laboratory methodologies), whenever possible (e.g., when sufficient information is provided about the methods used for chemical analyses). Finally, most people make diet choices based on foods rather than nutrients, so focusing on foods rather than on individual nutrients to achieve nutrient-related positive outcomes is more accessible and amenable to translation in practice (Tapsell et al., 2016). An alternative, more practical approach to evaluate the potential nutritional role of food tree products, overcoming the limitations of nutritional data, is the use of food groups, a nutrition-sensitive classification of foods, commonly used in food consumption surveys to determine diet diversity or to develop food-based dietary guidelines (Herforth et al., 2019). As tree foods vary between countries and regions, the use of food groups enables comparing information on dietary quality without losing detailed information. In addition, the timing of availability of nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, should be seen in the context of seasonal fluctuations in food and nutrient availability. The intra-annual variation in food availability is well captured in seasonal food calendars (Lochetti et al., 2020), food tree portfolios (McMullin et al., 2019), or other visual materials that promote enhancement of diet quality through consumption of a range of locally available seasonal foods, supporting nutrition education and awareness raising. Here, we focused on the contributions that different tree food products can make to improving diet diversity of otherwise mostly monotonous staple-based diets prevalent in Burkina Faso. More specifically, we developed a methodology that enables carrying out context-specific choices of tree species to be considered in FLR to optimize year-round availability of different food groups, complementing the locally available main crops, such as grains (sorghum, pearl millet, maize and rice, and fonio), root and tubers (e.g., yam and sweet potato) and pulses (e.g., Bambara nut and black-eyed peas). We used Burkina Faso as a model case, integrating the methodology into a freely available decision-making tool called Diversity for Restoration (D4R; www.diversityforrestoration.org; see Box 1), but the methodology can be scaled to other geographies. D4R aims at supporting tree-planting decisions in a broad sense, by including a wide range of tree-planting objectives (e.g., restoration based on ecological principles, biodiversity conservation, timber production, and production of non-timber forest products) and covering different possible configurations (including woodlots, agroforestry systems, and hedgerows). The word ‘restoration’ in the name of the tool refers more generally to the prospect of restoring ecosystem functions on degraded land previously forested or occupied by tree-based systems. Guiding principles are the use of a diverse portfolio of well-adapted species and properly selected tree seed sources. We demonstrate how the careful selection of locally adapted food trees could contribute to mitigate local nutritional gaps through FLR initiatives. More specifically, we aimed at developing a methodology to select a portfolio of tree species that optimizes (i) availability of edible products through complementarity in seasonality (i.e., maximizing product availability throughout the year) and (ii) diet diversity through complementarity in the food groups represented by the different edible products (i.e., maximizing diet diversification). Burkina Faso is characterized by two main ecoregions. About a third of the country is part of the Sahelian ecoregion (300–700 mm of annual precipitation, with a dry season of 7–8 months), and the remaining area is part of the Sudanian ecoregion (700–1100 mm of annual precipitation, with a dry season of <6 months) (Boussim, 2010; Guinko, 1984). The main characteristics of the Sahelian ecoregion are a low cover of woody vegetation, generally dominated by thorny trees and shrubs, and a discontinuous herbaceous layer dominated by annual grasses. The Sudanian ecoregion presents a greater cover of woody vegetation and a dense and tall herbaceous layer, sometimes with perennial grasses. The diversity of species increases from north to south, along a climatic gradient, mainly driven by annual precipitation and the length of the rainy season (Bognounou et al., 2009). The flora of Burkina Faso has a very large number of food plants, either growing spontaneously or cultivated, playing a critical role in the diets and income generation of the rural population (Zizka, Thiombiano, Dressler, Nacoulma, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, et al., 2015). The various edible parts of plants are consumed in different ways (Thiombiano et al., 2010): raw, cooked (e.g., leaves of baobab, Adansonia digitata, or flowers of the red kapok tree, Bombax costatum), or further processed (e.g., shea butter from the shea tree, Vitellaria paradoxa, or the sauce derived from the fermentation of the seeds of nerè, P. biglobosa). The plants used, as well as the recipes, vary considerably from one location to another due to differences in cultural background and plant species locally available (Gouwakinnou et al., 2011; Pawera et al., 2020; Reyes-García et al., 2015). The steps taken to identify and characterize food tree species with potential for restoration are presented in Figure 1. First, a set of priority tree species, considered important for local livelihoods in Burkina Faso for providing desirable goods and services, was assembled based on the literature (Sop et al., 2012; Zizka, Thiombiano, Dressler, Nacoulma, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, Zizka, et al., 2015) and interviews with farmers and local experts, within the frame of different projects and initiatives (e.g., Gaisberger et al., 2018). After excluding those species without edible products, a list of 56 food tree species was retained. Species taxonomy follows the WorldFlora database (WFO, 2022). In a next step, information was gathered for each identified food tree species about the specific parts consumed by humans (fruit, leaves, gum, shoot, root, and sap) and their culinary uses (ways of consumption in different dishes or as specific products, e.g., as a cooked vegetable, as a condiment, and as raw fruit). In addition, for each edible product, the seasonality was recorded (months of the year the product is available). The seasonal picture provided is an underestimate of availability, as it does not consider edible items which can be stored for a long time (e.g., dried baobab leaves). Data were partly harvested from scientific literature (Lamien et al., 2018; Parkouda et al., 2018; Zizka, Thiombiano, Dressler, Nacoulma, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, Ouédraogo, et al., 2015; Supporting Information with additional references), but most importantly were compiled by local experts who are co-authors on this paper (nutritionists, botanists, ethnobotanists, and foresters), especially for the lesser known species. We considered that the contribution of edible products from trees in meeting local nutritional needs should be based on two key aspects. One aspect is the extent to which edible products from trees cover different food groups, thus contributing to diet diversification. The second aspect is the seasonal availability of edible products, particularly in relation to critical food and nutrient gaps. Diets tend to differ substantially according to the availability of agricultural products during the different seasons, especially if access to staple foods and the possibility to cover the nutritional needs of a population depends primarily on local agricultural production. In Burkina Faso, this seasonal variation in the diet is observed both in rural and urban populations (Becquey et al., 2012 for Ouagadougou; Arsenault et al., 2014 for the rural environment). Regarding cultivated plants, the harvest of rainfed crops takes place between October and December, while horticultural crops (mainly onions and tomatoes) are harvested from January to May (Lourme-Ruiz et al., 2021; Somé & Jones, 2018). The critical months in terms of food availability (mainly cereals) coincide with the peak of the lean season (June–August), while the lowest diversity of food groups consumed tends to coincide with the post-harvest season (lowest in January, but generally low from August to January), based on research covering a broad range of edible products (de Kok et al., 2021; Lourme-Ruiz et al., 2021; Somé & Jones, 2018). Despite this clear general pattern, variability among households is largely influenced by the level of diversity of own production on farm, the degree of access to purchased food, and the degree of reliance on foraging by gathering, hunting, or fishing (Lourme-Ruiz et al., 2021). For our purposes, the seasonal availability of different edible products from trees was defined based on phenological data provided by experts. However, for some products, these data presented minor discrepancies among experts, owing to ecoregional variations in phenology and climatic changes, and we merged data from different sources. Then, all edible products from the targeted tree species were assigned to a food group. We used the food groups employed to enumerate the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of reproductive age (MDD-W; FAO, 2021). This is a validated population-based indicator used as proxy to assess micronutrient adequacy of diet of women of reproductive age in multiple countries and contexts (Arimond et al., 2010). The MDD-W consists of 10 food groups: grains; white roots and tubers and plantains; pulses (beans, peas and lentils); nuts and seeds; milk and milk products; meat, poultry, and fish; eggs; dark-green leafy vegetables; other vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables; other vegetables; and other fruits. We retained all six food groups that can be provided by trees: white roots and tubers and plantains; nuts and seeds; dark-green leafy vegetables; vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables; other vegetables; and other fruits. Furthermore, we considered two food groups that are optional in the MDD-W indicator, namely, “red palm oil” and “other oils and fats.” An explanation of each of the food groups is given in Table 1. © B. Vinceti © B. Vinceti © B. Vinceti © M. Valette © M. Schmidt © B. Vinceti © B. Vinceti © B. Vinceti Foods such as condiments and spices, gums, sweets/chewing gum, or leaves and flowers to make tea were included in the tool among the species considered for the general “food” objective. Yet they were excluded from the objective “maximize nutritional diversity” (see below) as they are not typically considered among the abovementioned food groups, based on FAO (2021). All food tree species identified were included in the online tool D4R (see Box 1). As a first filter, the tool uses species distribution models to identify the species that can grow under the environmental conditions at the planting site under present and future climate. Species distribution models under current and future conditions were based on available occurrence data gathered from different sources (BIEN, 2020; Global Biodiversity Information Facility [GBIF], 2020; plot data from association Tiipaalga; Brandis et al., 2007; Brunken et al., 2008; Herbarium of the University of Aarhus, 2020; Heubes, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012) and climate models for AfriClim (Platts et al., 2014). Data were processed following a standard pipeline (Fremout et al., 2022). Next, the tool uses a range of species traits (including functional traits and local uses) to score how well each of the retained species are able to establish and persist under the site conditions (e.g., compacted soils, grazing pressure, and steep slopes) and match the restoration objectives (e.g., erosion control, bird conservation, and timber production). Trait data were extracted from the literature (Arbonnier, 2004; Orwa et al., 2009; Sacande et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2013; see full list of references in Dataset S1) and from interviews with experts from rural communities and local scientists. Further details about the trait-based species scoring are provided in Fremout et al. (2022). While food was already included as a restoration objective in the original D4R tool, species were only scored in a binary way (i.e., providing edible products or not). In the improved tool for Burkina Faso presented here, tree species “aptness scores” for the restoration objective “food” are calculated as the number of “food group months,” with one “food group month” referring to the availability of one food group in 1 month. For example, if a tree species provides both vitamin A-rich fruits and dark-green leafy vegetables in April, this counts as two “food group months.” Hence, species scores increase both with increasing number of food groups and increasing number of months with edible products available. D4R (https://www.diversityforrestoration.org/; Fremout et al., 2022) is a user-friendly online tool that is designed to assist decision-makers and restoration practitioners with the selection of tree species and seed sources that are adapted to the restoration site conditions and meet the restoration objectives. Depending on the planting site location, restoration site conditions and restoration objectives (see example in the screenshot included), the user receives recommendations on combinations of species to plant, where to get the seeds, and how to propagate the species. The tool is currently operational for the tropical dry forests of Colombia and northwestern Peru–southern Ecuador, the highland forests of western Oromia in Ethiopia, and the countries of Burkina Faso and Cameroon, while further expansion is underway. The tool integrates (i) species habitat suitability maps under current and future climatic conditions; (ii) analysis of functional trait data, local ecological knowledge, and other relevant species characteristics, such as species threat status, to score how well species match the site conditions and restoration objectives; (iii) optimization of functional trait diversity or phylogenetic diversity to foster complementarity effects; and (iv) development of seed zone maps to guide the sourcing of planting material adapted to present and expected future environmental conditions. Acknowledging the wide range of meanings and goals of restoration, the tool is intended to support decision-making for anyone interested in tree-based restoration in tropical forest landscapes, regardless of the purpose, and it fosters the achievement of multiple objectives via optimal combinations of species traits (adapted from Fremout et al., 2022). User interface of the D4R tool, with a map-based visualization of the restoration site and the filters for selecting different objectives of the restoration initiative to be implemented. Next, the tool jointly optimizes the abovementioned species aptness scores and a diversity metric. By default, the tool optimizes a functional diversity metric (Fremout et al., 2022). As part of the improvement of the tool for nutrition-sensitive restoration, we added the optimization of nutritional diversity as an additional objective. To take into account both the diversity in food groups and “phenological diversity” (i.e., differences between species in terms of availability of food groups throughout the year), the diversity metric to be optimized consists of the average of a “food group dissimilarity” matrix, containing the Sørensen dissimilarities between species based on a binary species-by-food group matrix, and a “phenological dissimilarity” matrix, containing the Sørensen dissimilarities between species based on a binary matrix expressing the availability of food products per month. The joint optimization of species aptness scores and the abovementioned diversity metric is carried out with the “selectSpecies” function of the “Select” package (Laughlin et al., 2018); this results in a species assemblage in which both species composition and suggested relative planting abundances are optimized. This function allows to select species assemblages that simultaneously maximize a diversity metric and converge the average trait value (in this case the “trait” used was the species aptness score, that is, the number of “food group months” for the restoration objective “food”) of the species assemblage on a predefined value. The package provides two measures of diversity that can be optimized: entropy H′, a species diversity index (Shipley et al., 2006, also known as the Shannon diversity index) and quadratic entropy Q (Pavoine, 2012; Rao, 1982), a functional diversity index (here the average of the “food group dissimilarity” and “phenological dissimilarity,” as explained above). For a given a set of species and an “optimal” trait (i.e., the species aptness score) value, maximizing H′ results in an assemblage of species whose average trait values converge on this value, with relative species abundances distributed as evenly as possible, whereas maximizing Q maximizes the relative abundances of the most dissimilar species (i.e., resulting in a species assemblage without species with “intermediate” trait values) (Laughlin et al., 2018). Given that neither option is optimal for many restoration applications, Laughlin et al. (2018) provide the option to maximize both metrics simultaneously, with the φ parameter weighting the importance of Q (i.e., a φ value of 1 results in only maximizing Q), leading to results lying between the two extremes mentioned above. Recognizing that there are no silver bullet solutions to species selection, the D4R tool provides three options of recommended species. The first combination strikes a balance between species aptness scores and diversity (with the aptness score S set at the 0.80 quantile of the aptness scores and φ set at 0.50), the second focuses on diversity (with S set at the 0.60 quantile of the aptness scores and φ set at 0.70), and the third one focuses on the degree of species aptness for the selected site conditions and restoration objectives (with S set at the 0.95 quantile of the aptness scores and φ set at 0.30). Data on edible products were collected for 56 food tree species (see all details in Dataset S2). Species span across 28 botanical families; the largest share is represented by Fabaceae (18 species), followed by Anacardiaceae (6), Combretaceae (5), Arecaceae (4), and Capparaceae (4). About two thirds of the species listed produce more than a single edible product. Most species supply two edible products (30 species), but some provide up to four. Of the 56 food tree species examined, 43 supply edible products that are consumed in quantities above 15 g and can be categorized under different food groups, based on FAO (2021). Considering these 43 food tree species together, the availability of their edible products is the highest between December and July, with the total number of products ranging between 30 and 34 (Figures 2 and 3). This peak is driven by the availability of dark-green leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds, Vitamin A-rich fruits, and other fruits, which all reach highest availability in these months. Interestingly, this period of the year coincides with the first part of the lean season (associated with a scarcity of cereals). September and October are the months in which the diversity of food groups covered by food tree products in our inventory is lowest. This period coincides with the end of the rainy season and the start of the harvest season. We found high variability in the number of months during which food products of individual tree species are available. A total of 11 species supplies edible products throughout the year (e.g., fruit of Gardenia erubescens, leaves and seeds of Moringa oleifera, and leaves of Combretum glutinosum). From the 56 food trees documented in Burkina Faso, 81 edible items can be used as food. These are mostly fruits (supplied by 79% of tree species), followed by seeds (52%) and leaves (41%). Regarding the subset of 43 tree species, the main food groups represented are “Other fruits” (other than vitamin A-rich fruits) (covering 52% of the edible products) and dark-green leafy vegetables (29%). Ways of consumption vary considerably. The most common culinary uses reported for different edible parts of the targeted species are the following (see Dataset S2): (a) fruits are commonly consumed raw, more rarely they are boiled or used to prepare beverages; (b) seeds are treated in different ways: occasionally consumed raw

TI  - Dietary diversity of rural Indonesian households declines over time with agricultural production diversity even as incomes rise
PY  - 2021
AB  - Despite great strides in reducing hunger over the last two decades, malnutrition remains a major challenge in Indonesia. High rates of child stunting coexist with high and increasing rates of overweight and obesity despite rapid economic growth and reductions in poverty over the last two decades. Part of this economic growth has been driven by a change in agricultural production systems from traditional farming techniques with farmers growing multiple crops to more intensified, specialized and commercialized farms. The objective of this study is to analyze how changes in the structure of agricultural production have affected diets in rural Indonesian households over time. We use three waves of a panel data set from the Indonesian Family Life Survey with a balanced sample of 2785 rural households covering the period between 2000 and 2015 to see how households’ food choices have been changing over time in response to the changes in production systems. We find positive relationships between production diversity and household dietary diversity as well as between market access and household dietary diversity. However, we see that there has been an overall decline in dietary diversity over time in the same households as their production diversity has declined. This decline in dietary diversity was mostly driven by the decreased consumption of nutritious food groups (fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish). Although the magnitude of the association between dietary diversity and production diversity was relatively small, the association between household production and consumption of some of these important food groups was quite substantial. The overall impact of increased specialization in Indonesia during the period 2000–2015 on dietary quality appears to have been negative.

TI  - Qualitative evidence for improved caring, feeding and food production practices after nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions in rural Vietnam.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Research on nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) has mostly been aimed at demonstrating its impact on nutrition and explicating underlying pathways, and more rarely at understanding processes and lessons learnt from them. This study aimed to gain insights into the processes that influence behaviour change, contributing to improved caring, feeding and food production practices, using a program theory perspective. It also investigated perceived challenges to the sustainability of interventions and potential solutions, in the context of an NSA program in rural Vietnam. Using a participatory approach, data were gathered on impact pathways and perceived outcomes, on elements of program theory that led to behavioural change, as well as barriers and facilitators. Respondents in semi-structured interviews (<i>n</i> = 30) and seven focus group discussions (total <i>n</i> = 76) were selected purposively among program participants. Data was collected and triangulated across several stakeholder groups.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The impact pathways (production-consumption, caring and feeding, and home-grown school feeding) envisaged in the NSA program functioned as intended; synergies were revealed. The increased supply of locally produced nutrient-rich foods not only contributed to the emergence of a promising income sub-pathway but also reinforced synergy with the home-grown school feeding pathway. Improved diets, feeding and caring practices, and school attendance were key outcomes of the program. Successful elements were pathway-specific, such as flexibility in implementing context-appropriate agricultural models. Others, such as benefit-driven motivation and improved knowledge, triggered changes in multiple pathways. Role models, increased self-confidence, and change agents were the main process facilitators. The biggest barrier to both implementation and sustainability was the poor socio-economic conditions of the most disadvantaged households.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study showed the relevance of NSA programs in addressing undernutrition in remote areas by enhancing self-reliance in local communities. The integration of behaviour change activities proved to be a key strategy in the process to enhance the impact of agriculture on nutrition outcomes. Though outcomes and influencing factors are very context-dependent, lessons on what worked and what did not work could inform the design and implementation of effective behaviour change strategies in future NSA programs in Vietnam and elsewhere.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Demonstration gardens improve agricultural production, food security and preschool child diets in subsistence farming communities in Panama
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives: To explore impacts of a demonstration garden-based agricultural intervention on agricultural knowledge, practices and production, food security and preschool child diet diversity of subsistence farming households. Design: Observational study of households new to the intervention or participating for 1 or 5 years. Variables measured were agricultural techniques learned from the intervention and used, agricultural production, household food insecurity (FIS) and child diet diversity (DDS), over one agricultural cycle (during land preparation, growing and harvest months). Setting: Fifteen rural subsistence farming communities in Panama. Participants: Households participating in intervention (n 237) with minimum one preschool child. Results: After 1 year, participants had more learned and applied techniques, more staple crops produced and lower FIS and higher DDS during land preparation and growing months compared with those new to the intervention. After 5 years, participants grew more maize, chickens and types of crops and had higher DDS during growing months and, where demonstration gardens persisted, used more learned techniques and children ate more vitamin A-rich foods. Variables associated with DDS varied seasonally: during land preparation, higher DDS was associated with higher household durable asset-based wealth; during growing months, with greater diversity of vegetables planted and lower FIS; during harvest, with older caregivers, caregivers working less in agriculture, more diverse crops and receiving food from demonstration gardens. Conclusions: The intervention improved food production, food security and diets. Sustained demonstration gardens were important for continued use of new agricultural techniques and improved diets.

TI  - Association between Household Livestock Ownership and Childhood Stunting in Bangladesh – A Spatial Analysis
PY  - 2019
AB  - Livestock is an integrated part of agriculture, yet the relationship between household livestock ownership and child nutrition is a significant knowledge gap. The present study aimed to assess the association between household livestock ownership and childhood stunting and to explore the geospatial variations at district level in Bangladesh. A complete data of 19 295 children aged below 5 years were extracted from the latest Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2012-13. The tropical livestock unit (TLU) score calculated as a weighted value for each livestock and categorized as low, medium, and high using tertile. A hierarchical Bayesian spatial logistic model was used to assess the association between TLU and childhood stunting. Children from the household with high TLU were 10% less likely to be stunted (adjusted posterior odds ratio: 0.90, 95% credible interval: 0.84-0.97) after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, morbidity, place of residence and spatial effects. There was also a substantial spatial variation in childhood stunting across districts in Bangladesh with the highest burden in the Northern and North-Eastern regions. The positive effect of household livestock ownership on reducing child stunting suggests that, in addition to nutritional intervention in Bangladesh, efforts to strengthen livestock production would be beneficial for improving child nutrition status. However, a small effect size may be owing to the lack of dietary diversity, livestock health and productivity data as well as the complexity of the relationship, requiring further study. Furthermore, a significant regional disparity in stunting highlighted the importance of spatial targeting during the design of interventions and implementation.

TI  - Upscaling Participatory Action and Videos for Agriculture and Nutrition (UPAVAN) trial comparing three variants of a nutrition-sensitive agricultural extension intervention to improve maternal and child nutritional outcomes in rural Odisha, India: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Maternal and child undernutrition have adverse consequences for pregnancy outcomes and child morbidity and mortality, and they are associated with low educational attainment, economic productivity as an adult, and human wellbeing. ‘Nutrition-sensitive’ agriculture programs could tackle the underlying causes of undernutrition. This study is a four-arm cluster randomised controlled trial in Odisha, India. Interventions are as follows: (1) an agricultural extension platform of women’s groups viewing and discussing videos on nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) practices, and follow-up visits to women at home to encourage the adoption of new practices shown in the videos; (2) women’s groups viewing and discussing videos on NSA and nutrition-specific practices, with follow-up visits; and (3) women’s groups viewing and discussing videos on NSA and nutrition-specific practices combined with a cycle of Participatory Learning and Action meetings, with follow-up visits. All arms, including the control, receive basic nutrition training from government community frontline workers. Primary outcomes, assessed at baseline and 32 months after the start of the interventions, are (1) percentage of children aged 6–23 months consuming ≥ 4 out of 7 food groups per day and (2) mean body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) of non-pregnant, non-postpartum (gave birth > 42 days ago) mothers or female primary caregivers of children aged 0–23 months. Secondary outcomes are percentage of mothers consuming ≥ 5 out of 10 food groups per day and percentage of children’s weight-for-height z-score 70%) proportion of Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste (disadvantaged) households. A process evaluation will assess the quality of implementation and mechanisms behind the intervention effects. A cost-consequence analysis will compare incremental costs and outcomes of the interventions. This trial will contribute evidence on the impacts of NSA extension through participatory, low-cost, video-based approaches on maternal and child nutrition and on whether integration with nutrition-specific goals and enhanced participatory approaches can increase these impacts.

TI  - Effect of integrated nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific intervention package on maternal malnutrition among pregnant women in Rwanda.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Maternal undernutrition remains a major public health concern in Rwanda despite significant gains and progress. An integration of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions was implemented in five districts of Rwanda to improve maternal and child nutrition. The package included nutrition education and counselling, promotion of agricultural productivity, promotion of financial literacy/economic resilience and provision of Water, Hygiene and Sanitation services. However, there is limited evidence about the effect of such interventions in reducing maternal undernutrition. A postintervention quasi-experimental study was conducted among pregnant women to determine the effect of the integrated intervention on their nutritional status. It was carried out in two intervention districts, namely Kicukiro and Kayonza, and two control districts, namely Gasabo and Gisagara between November 2020 and June 2021. Five hundred and fifty-two women were recruited for the intervention arm, while 545 were recruited for the control arm. Maternal undernutrition was defined as either having low mid-upper arm circumference (<23 cm) during delivery or low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) in the first trimester or both. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the effect of the integrated interventions. The prevalence of maternal undernutrition was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (4.7% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.001). After controlling the potential confounders, the risk of maternal undernutrition was 77.0% lower in the intervention group than in the control group [adjusted odds ratio= 0.23; 95% confidence interval = 0.15-0.36; p < 0.001]. Further studies are therefore recommended to establish causation and inform the potential scale-up of these interventions nationally in Rwanda.

TI  - Small-Scale Livestock Production in Nepal Is Directly Associated with Children's Increased Intakes of Eggs and Dairy, But Not Meat.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Animal source foods (ASF) provide nutrients essential to child growth and development yet remain infrequently consumed in rural Nepal. Agriculture and nutrition programs aim to increase ASF intake among children through small-scale animal husbandry projects. The relationship between livestock ownership and children's consumption of ASF, however, is not well established. This study examined associations between livestock ownership and the frequency with which Nepali children consume eggs, dairy, and meat. We analyzed longitudinal 7-day food frequency data from sentinel surveillance sites of the Policy and Science of Health, Agriculture and Nutrition (PoSHAN) study. Data consisted of surveys from 485 Nepali farming households conducted twice per year for two years (a total of 1449 surveys). We used negative binomial regression analysis to examine the association between the number of cattle, poultry, and meat animals (small livestock) owned and children's weekly dairy, egg, and meat intakes, respectively, adjusting for household expenditure on each food type, mother's education level, caste/ethnicity, agroecological region, season, and child age and sex. We calculated predicted marginal values based on model estimates. Children consumed dairy 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-2.0), 2.3 (1.7-3.0) and 3.0 (2.1-4.2) more times per week in households owning 1, 2-4 and >4 cattle, respectively, compared to children in households without cattle. Children consumed eggs 2.8 (2.1-3.7) more times per week in households owning 1 or 2 chickens compared to children in households without chickens. Child intake of meat was higher only in households owning more than seven meat animals. Children's intakes of dairy, eggs, and meat rose with household expenditure on these foods. Small-scale animal production may be an effective strategy for increasing children's consumption of eggs and dairy, but not meat. Increasing household ability to access ASF via purchasing appears to be an important approach for raising children's intakes of all three food types.

TI  - Farm Production Diversification and Dietary Diversity among Subsistence Farming Households: Panel Data Evidence from South Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Improving the production of a variety of foods by subsistence farmers has been identified as a key strategy for improving dietary diversity. However, there is limited evidence in South Africa on how one’s own production is linked to dietary diversity. This study relies on nationally representative panel data to investigate the extent to which farm production diversity is correlated with dietary diversity. The data indicated a moderate level of household dietary diversity that has been on a declining trend between 2008 and 2017. The farm households produced three food groups (meat, cereals, and vegetables), suggesting more reliance on food purchases than own production. The study found a positive relationship between own production diversification and dietary diversity and that dietary diversity varied by demographics and socio-economic characteristics of households. However, production diversity was not significantly associated with the consumption of micronutrient-rich foods such as fruits or vegetables. Higher levels of education, income per capita, food expenditure, and geographic location were some of the key drivers of dietary diversity among subsistence households. The findings suggest that encouraging subsistence farming households to produce various crop and animal species can be an effective strategy to improve dietary diversity among poor households in South Africa.

While small-scale irrigation is a key factor driving agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan Africa, its impact on nutrition has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this study, we assess the impact of adoption of small-scale irrigation in Ethiopia and Tanzania on household and women's dietary diversity, as well as children's nutrition. We use two rounds of primary data collected from irrigators and nonirrigators in Ethiopia and Tanzania. We used a panel fixed effects econometric approach to control for observed household, women and children specific characteristics as well as observed and unobserved time-invariant confounding factors. The results show that among Ethiopian households who reported having faced drought, women in irrigating households have higher Women's Dietary Diversity Score (WDDS) compared to women in nonirrigating households. In Tanzania, women in irrigating households have higher WDDS compared to nonirrigators and the impact of irrigation on WDDS more than doubles among households facing drought. In addition, among Tanzanian households who reported having faced a drought shock, irrigating households have higher Household Dietary Diversity Score compared to nonirrigators. Children in irrigating households in Ethiopia have weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) that are 0.87 SDs higher, on average, than WHZ of children in nonirrigating households. In Tanzania, irrigation leads to higher WHZ-scores in children under-five among households who reported having experienced a drought in the 5 years preceding the survey. The study shows small-scale irrigation has a strong effect on households' economic access to food and on nutritional outcomes of women and children.

TI  - Do agricultural support and cash transfer programmes improve nutritional status
PY  - 2021
AB  - Cash transfer and agricultural support programmes are both used to improve nutrition outcomes in developing countries. Previous reviews of these programmes have examined their ability to improve both food consumption and anthropometric outcomes, but none has compared the evidence between the two. We update previous reviews, more than doubling the number of studies on each programme type based on an additional literature search of over 13,000 articles in eight databases. We find: (i) although there are about the same number of programmes of each type, many more papers have been written about the cash transfer programmes than the agricultural programmes; (ii) both programme types improved the quality of food consumption though evidence on quantity is more mixed; and (iii) both programme types show weak evidence of improvements in anthropometric outcomes.

TI  - A Community-Based Early Childhood Development Center Platform Promoting Diversified Diets and Food Production Increases the Mean Probability of Adequacy of Intake of Preschoolers in Malawi: A Cluster Randomized Trial
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background Young children in Malawi consume low-quality diets lacking micronutrients critical for their development. Objective To evaluate the impact of an agriculture and nutrition behavior change communication (BCC) intervention implemented through community-based childcare centers on the nutrient adequacy of diets of children living in food-insecure settings in Malawi. Methods A cluster randomized trial was undertaken in 60 community-based childcare centers, including 1248 children aged 3-6 y. Nutrient intakes were estimated using interactive, multipass 24-h recall. Dietary adequacy was estimated through the probability of adequacy (PA) and mean probability of adequacy (MPA) of 11 micronutrients. Impacts were assessed by difference-in-difference (DID) estimates, adjusted for geographic clustering and child age and sex. Results Intervention groups were similar for most baseline characteristics. Loss to follow-up was low (7% over a 12-mo period) and participation in the intervention was high (>90% enrollment and 80% attendance during the 5 d before the survey). Positive impacts were found for the PA of several individual micronutrient intakes: vitamin A [DID: 9 percentage points (pp), SE 3 pp], vitamin C (14 pp, SE 3 pp), riboflavin (11 pp, SE 3 pp), zinc (8 pp, SE 3 pp), and for the MPA for the 11 nutrients considered (5 pp, SE 1 pp). These impacts were driven by effects on younger children (aged 3-4 y). Conclusions Using a preschool platform to implement a nutrition-sensitive BCC intervention is an effective strategy to improve the adequacy of micronutrient intake of preschool children in food-insecure settings. The trial was registered at ISCRCTN as ISCRCTN96497560.

TI  - Managing fisheries for maximum nutrient yield.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Wild-caught fish are a bioavailable source of nutritious food that, if managed strategically, could enhance diet quality for billions of people. However, optimising nutrient production from the sea has not been a priority, hindering development of nutrition-sensitive policies. With fisheries management increasingly effective at rebuilding stocks and regulating sustainable fishing, we can now begin to integrate nutritional outcomes within existing management frameworks. Here, we develop a conceptual foundation for managing fisheries for multispecies Maximum Nutrient Yield (mMNY). We empirically test our approach using size-based models of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries and show that mMNY is predicted by the relative contribution of nutritious species to total catch and their vulnerability to fishing, leading to trade-offs between catch and specific nutrients. Simulated nutrient yield curves suggest that vitamin D, which is deficient in Northern European diets, was underfished at fishing levels that returned maximum catch weights. Analysis of global catch data shows there is scope for nutrient yields from most of the world's marine fisheries to be enhanced through nutrient-sensitive fisheries management. With nutrient composition data now widely available, we expect our mMNY framework to motivate development of nutrient-based reference points in specific contexts, such as data-limited fisheries. Managing for mMNY alongside policies that promote access to fish could help close nutrient gaps for coastal populations, maximising the contribution of wild-caught fish to global food and nutrition security.

TI  - Gender, time-use, and energy expenditures in rural communities in India and Nepal
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Women’s patterns of time-use, which proxy the work burdens associated with productive and reproductive activities, are an important determinant of nutrition and well-being in LMICs. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time-use translate into patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure, particularly in rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important role. We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived from wearable tri-axial accelerometers with time-use data from conventional recall-based surveys. Using datasets from agricultural households in four rural communities in India and Nepal, our results show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of time-use and energy expenditure. Men and women participate equally in productive work, however, women shoulder most of the additional reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure opportunities. Our results provide insights into women’s responses to opportunities for productive work and highlight the nature of trade-offs they face.

TI  - Can governments promote homestead gardening at scale? Evidence from Ethiopia.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Low intake of fruits and vegetables is a major cause of micronutrient deficiencies in the developing world. Since the 1980s, various non-governmental organizations have promoted homestead gardening (HG) programs, first in Asia, but now increasingly in Africa. Longstanding concerns with HG programs are: (1) they lack scalability, particularly for governments; (2) they only work in areas with/without good access to markets; and (3) they are only suitable for more water-abundant ecologies. We assess these concerns by analyzing a large and novel survey on the adoption of a nationwide HG program implemented by the Ethiopian government. We find that better market access encourages HG adoption; so too does greater public promotion of HGs, but only in more water-abundant ecologies.

TI  - Looking beyond calories—when food quality and sourcing matters
PY  - 2023
AB  - Farming systems are key to achieving the Sustainable Development goals of Zero Poverty and Zero Hunger. Yet, more than half of food-insecure people live in rural areas. Persistent yield gaps, poverty traps, disinterest in investing in agricultural activities, and population growth put pressure on agricultural landscapes, threatening food security and preservation of natural resources. In addition, narratives around food security often focus on caloric intake and overlook dietary complexity. This is a transdisciplinary study that assesses the complexity of food insecurity across smallholder farming systems, as affected by farmers' goals, drivers, assets, and economic performance. The study was conducted in Donomadé, a marginalized village in Togo, West Africa. Through 81 surveys and 28 in-depth interviews, qualitative and quantitative data on demography, market integration, production systems, and farmers' perspectives on agriculture were gathered. A household Archetypal Analysis was performed. The mean adequacy ratio (MAR) was calculated based on the consumption of one Adult Male Equivalent (AME) of 18 nutritional elements (including macronutrients, micronutrients, and vitamins). The MAR was used to compare food security across archetypes. Twenty percent of the households would be considered food secure if only caloric intake was considered. However, no household was completely food secure when assessing the MAR for 18 nutritional elements. The MAR varied across the five archetypes identified (A–E). Archetypes D and E had the highest MAR of 0.82 and 0.85, respectively. These archetypes had the lowest land pressure, expressed in AME per hectare. Archetypes A, B, and C had a MAR of 0.35, 0.53, and 0.32, respectively. They differed in income source, land pressure, and desire to abandon agricultural activities. Households' food security was also impacted by how much food they sold and bought. Only archetype E bought more food than they sold. Food security levels vary across households. Narratives concentrated around caloric intake can lead to an underestimation of the issue of food insecurity. Due to lack of alternative sources of income, households are forced to sell part of their production. Most of the time, the food sold is not compensated by the food bought, creating deeper gaps in households’ food security.

TI  - Ameliorating Food and Nutrition Security in Farm Households: Does Informatization Matter?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Improving food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa’s farm households has become a prominent priority subject for researchers and policymakers alike. Interestingly, it is realized through enhancement in dietary diversity and quality. To this end, better access to food and information is considered a prerequisite. Given that mobile phone coverage offers new prospects for increasing rural households’ access to information, can informatization (mobile phone used as a concrete example) possibly influence dietary diversity and quality? Cross-sectional data collected from farm households in Zambia is used to address this topic by applying the ordinary least square and endogenous switching regression (ESR). Household dietary diversity score was constructed based on a 7-days recall approach to measure consumption patterns. Our robust regression result indicates that mobile phone use positively and significantly influences dietary diversity and quality. Particularly, gender-disaggregated regression reveals that male-headed households have stronger positive associations than their counterparts. We also find that in comparison to non-adopters, adopters consume three more foods weekly. This is attributable to the income gains and increased frequency in information access on account of mobile phone adoption. Conversely, average consumption would increase by two more foods weekly if mobile phones were adopted in non-adopting households. Therefore, our study puts forwards substantial empirical evidence to warrant policy formulation directed at promoting informatization among farm households. Eventually, this could possibly recuperate dynamism in agricultural food production as food and nutrition security in farm households ameliorates.

TI  - Rural Food Markets and Child Nutrition.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Child dietary diversity is poor in much of rural Africa and developing Asia, prompting significant efforts to leverage agriculture to improve diets. However, growing recognition that even very poor rural households rely on markets to satisfy their demand for nutrient-rich non-staple foods warrants a much better understanding of how rural markets vary in their diversity, competitiveness, frequency and food affordability, and how such characteristics are associated with diets. This article addresses these questions using data from rural Ethiopia. Deploying a novel market survey in conjunction with an information-rich household survey, we find that children in proximity to markets that sell more non-staple food groups have more diverse diets. However, the association is small in absolute terms; moving from three non-staple food groups in the market to six is associated with an increase in the number of non-staple food groups consumed by ˜0.27 and the likelihood of consumption of any non-staple food group by 10 percentage points. These associations are similar in magnitude to those de-scribing the relationship between dietary diversity and household production diversity; moreover, for some food groups, notably dairy, we find that household and community production of that food is especially important. These modest associations may reflect several specific features of our sample which is situated in very poor, food-insecure localities where even the relatively better off are poor in absolute terms and where, by international standards, relative prices for non-staple foods are very high.

TI  - The Role of Aquaculture and Capture Fisheries in Meeting Food and Nutrition Security: Testing a Nutrition-Sensitive Pond Polyculture Intervention in Rural Zambia.
PY  - 2022
AB  - This study tested the efficacy of a pond polyculture intervention with farming households in northern Zambia. Longitudinal data on fish consumption and the associated nutrient intake of households (<i>N</i> = 57) were collected over a six-month period (September 2019-March 2020). One group of people tested the intervention while another group that practiced monoculture tilapia farming, and a third group that did not practice aquaculture, acted as control groups. A similar quantity of fish was consumed on average; however, the associated nutrient intake differed, based on the quantity and type of species consumed, particularly for those who had access to pelagic small fish from capture fisheries. There was a decrease in fish consumption from December onward due to fisheries management restrictions. The ponds provided access to micronutrient-rich fish during this time. Pond polyculture can act as a complementary source of fish to capture fisheries that are subjected to seasonal controls, as well as to households that farm tilapia. Assessments of how aquatic foods can improve food and nutrition security often separate aquaculture and capture fisheries, failing to account for people who consume fish from diverse sources simultaneously. A nutrition-sensitive approach thus places food and nutrition security, and consumers, at the center of the analysis.

TI  - Spatial typology for targeted food and nutrition security interventions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract In this paper we develop a typology to help design and improve spatial targeting of food and nutrition security (FNS) interventions. Using a comprehensive framework, the proposed approach allows for the broad identification and location of major food security bottlenecks. The resulting typology is based on an amendable demarcation of areas in a four-indicator diagram representing the four core dimensions of FNS. The proposed typology is applied to the rural territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Despite a continuum of heterogenous development challenges across the country, the typology helps identify clusters of territories that suffer from production, access, and utilization constraints. For the nine territories (out of 145) with the highest child stunting levels, we identify four broad intervention zones and analyze their efficiency profile in more detail. Despite its reductionist nature, our typology is conceptually sound, operationally flexible, and less data intensive, important features to promote evidence-based policymaking in contexts characterized by imperfect and scarce data.

TI  - Challenges to joint planning, monitoring, and evaluation for nutrition-sensitive agriculture in Ethiopia: an exploratory qualitative study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Nutrition-sensitive agriculture is an effective multi-sectoral approach to address the underlying causes of malnutrition. However, successful implementation requires the involvement of different sectors to jointly plan, monitor, and evaluate key activities, which is often challenged by contextual barriers.

TI  - Double-duty actions: seizing programme and policy opportunities to address malnutrition in all its forms
PY  - 2019
AB  - Actions to address different forms of malnutrition are typically managed by separate communities, policies, programmes, governance structures, and funding streams. By contrast, double-duty actions, which aim to simultaneously tackle both undernutrition and problems of overweight, obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCDs) have been proposed as a way to effectively address malnutrition in all its forms in a more holisitic way. This Series paper identifies ten double-duty actions that have strong potential to reduce the risk of both undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs. It does so by summarising evidence on common drivers of different forms of malnutrition; documenting examples of unintended harm caused by some undernutrition-focused programmes on obesity and DR-NCDs; and highlighting examples of double-duty actions to tackle multiple forms of malnutrition. We find that undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs are intrinsically linked through early-life nutrition, diet diversity, food environments, and socioeconomic factors. Some evidence shows that programmes focused on undernutrition have raised risks of poor quality diets, obesity, and DR-NCDs, especially in countries undergoing a rapid nutrition transition. This Series paper builds on this evidence to develop a framework to guide the design of double-duty approaches and strategies, and defines the first steps needed to deliver them. With a clear package of double-duty actions now identified, there is an urgent need to move forward with double-duty actions to address malnutrition in all its forms.

TI  - Nutrient Intake of Rural Households That Participated in a Farming System for Nutrition Study in India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Food based approach can prove effective in improving access and availability of nutrients from foods required for daily life where most of the people depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A study on feasibility of Farming Systems for Nutrition (FSN) approach was undertaken from 2013 to 2018 in a few villages of Koraput district, Odisha state and Wardha district, Maharashtra state in India. Interventions were done to increase crop diversity, intercropping of pulses and cereals, promotion of seasonal vegetables and fruits along with nutrition awareness. The endline survey showed increase in production diversity leading to improved household dietary diversity. This paper demonstrates the impact of FSN interventions on household nutrient intake. The results show that the intake of nutrients like protein, vitamin C, iron and calcium increased significantly in Koraput and all the nutrients including energy and vitamin A increased significantly in Wardha. The evidence shows that Farming System for Nutrition approach improves individual nutrient intake which in the long run can address the problem of undernutrition.

TI  - The role of poultry transfers in diet diversity: A cluster randomized intent to treat analysis
PY  - 2022
AB  - Poultry has gained renewed attention as a promising value chain for women because it is an asset that is widely accessible to women, has low start-up costs, and provides a good source of nutritious animal-sourced foods for children in chicken meat and, especially, eggs. The current study presents evidence from an experimental intervention that randomly provided women either a poultry package transfer of vaccinated, improved-breed chickens and related inputs, or a cash grant of equivalent value within a sample of households participating in a social safety net program. These transfers were embedded in a set of intensive livelihood and enhanced nutrition interventions as part of a broader experiment in rural Ethiopia. We assess the impact of the poultry package transfer as well as the enhanced nutrition intervention on the consumption of eggs by both children and adult women. We find that the poultry transfer increased the frequency of egg consumption as well as the sale of eggs, falling between the extreme of an autarkic household and one in which production decisions are fully separable from consumption choices.

TI  - Designing for empowerment impact in agricultural development projects: Experimental evidence from the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Gender Linkages (ANGeL) project in Bangladesh.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The importance of women’s roles for nutrition-sensitive agricultural projects is increasingly recognized, yet little is known about whether such projects improve women’s empowerment and gender equality. We study the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Gender Linkages (ANGeL) pilot project, which was implemented as a cluster-randomized controlled trial by the Government of Bangladesh. The project’s treatment arms included agricultural training, nutrition behavior change communication (BCC), and gender sensitization trainings delivered to husbands and wives together – with these components combined additively, such that the impact of gender sensitization could be distinguished from that of agriculture and nutrition trainings. Empowerment was measured using the internationally-validated project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI), and attitudes regarding gender roles were elicited from both men and women, to explore potentially gender-transformative impacts. Our study finds that ANGeL increased both women’s and men’s empowerment, raised the prevalence of households achieving gender parity, and led to small improvements in the gender attitudes of both women and men. We find significant increases in women’s empowerment scores and empowerment status from all treatment arms but with no significant differences across these. We find no evidence of unintended impacts on workloads and inconclusive evidence around impacts on intimate partner violence. Our results also suggest some potential benefits of bundling nutrition and gender components with an agricultural development intervention; however, many of these benefits seem to be driven by bundling nutrition with agriculture. While we cannot assess the extent to which including men and women within the same treatment arms contributed to our results, it is plausible that the positive impacts of all treatment arms on women’s empowerment outcomes may have arisen from implementation modalities that provided information to both husbands and wives when they were together. The role of engaging men and women jointly in interventions is a promising area for future research.

TI  - Diets of infants and young children in two counties of Kenya: Key drivers and barriers to improvement.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are influenced by many context-specific factors related to local food systems as well as social and cultural practices. Understanding these local contextual perspectives is essential for designing effective programs and policies. This paper uses focused ethnographic study methods to examine challenges experienced by mothers related to IYCF in two counties in Kenya, a country with considerable heterogeneity in agriculture, food systems, and cultures. A two-phase qualitative study was undertaken in each of Kilifi County and West Pokot County, entailing interviews and rating activities with mothers, health workers, and vendors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated into English, coded, and analysed by topic. Results show low levels of dietary diversity in both counties; in West Pokot, the level of adequate meal frequency is also low. Core foods in young child diets included maize porridge and family foods such as ugali (stiff maize porridge), vegetables, beans, fish, and plantains. Food safety, acceptability, and acquisition ease were the main drivers of food choice. Mothers generally felt that all core foods fed to young children are healthy and safe, but there was more variability regarding child acceptance, acquisition ease, cost, and convenience. Common barriers to feeding nutrient-dense foods to children included child illness, economic constraints, and limited knowledge of modification strategies, skills, or tools to make the foods suitable for young children. Potential actions to address these barriers include sharing information on child-appropriate recipes; raising awareness on local, affordable nutrient-dense foods; and improving WASH practices to reduce illness frequency.

TI  - Agricultural and empowerment pathways from land ownership to women's nutrition in India.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land size is an important equity concern for the design of 'nutrition-sensitive' agricultural interventions. We unpack some of the pathways between land and nutrition using a cross-sectional baseline survey data set of 4,480 women from 148 clusters from the 'Upscaling Participatory Action and Videos for Agriculture and Nutrition' trial in Keonjhar district in Odisha, India. Variables used are household ln-land size owned (exposure) and maternal dietary diversity score out of 10 food groups and body mass index (BMI; kg/m2 ) (outcomes); and mediators investigated are production diversity score, value of agricultural production, and indicators for women's empowerment (decision-making in agriculture, group participation, work-free time and land ownership). We assessed mediation using a non-parametric potential outcomes framework method. Land size positively affects maternal dietary diversity scores [β 0.047; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.011, 0.082)] but not BMI. Production diversity, but not value of production, accounts for 17.6% of total effect mediated. We observe suppression of the effect of land size on BMI, with no evidence of a direct effect for either of the agricultural mediators but indirect effects of β -0.031 [95% CI (-0.048, -0.017)] through production diversity and β -0.047 [95% CI (-0.075, -0.021)] through value of production. An increase in land size positively affects women's decision-making, which in turn negatively affects maternal BMI. The positive effect of work-free time on maternal BMI is suppressed by the negative effect of household land size on work-free time. Agriculture interventions must consider land quality, women's decision-making and implications for women's workload in their design.

TI  - Highlighting the role of agriculture and geospatial technology in food security and sustainable development goals
PY  - 2023
AB  - Food security is a global challenge that aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 1 - “No Poverty”, SDG 2 - “Zero Hunger,” SDG 3 - “Good Health and Well-being,” SDG 13 - “Climate Action,” and SDG 15 - “Life on Land.”. To effectively address this issue, a convergence of agriculture and technology is crucial, incorporating precision agriculture, sustainable agriculture, bio-economy and advanced technologies such as machineries, Artificial intelligence-meachine learning and geospatial technology. Recent trends in food security worldwide have witnessed the adoption of technological advancements. However, it is important to consider biodiversity when implementing and adopting technological advancements. The integration of technology in agricultural practices aim to reduce chemical usage in farms, while increased production remains the main objective of smart farming and Precision Agriculture. By minimizing the use or implementing localized approaches for chemicals on farms, we can preserve soil-faunal diversity, which is at risk along with targets due to excessive applications of pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides. Geospatial technology plays a significant role by leveraging remotely sensed images acquired through satellites, aerial platforms, and GPS-tagged drones to enhance agricultural practices, improve crop growth and increase crop yields. Through geospatial technology, we can map and monitor soil and crop conditions, and effectively conserve, protect, and manage biodiversity on a global scale. The applications of remote sensing technology consider ecological and environmental parameters, soil factors, crop conditions, and plant-soil diversity to optimize yields and agricultural productivity. Additionally, the evaluation of various agricultural practices such as sustainable agriculture, bio-economy, using technology can contribute to increased yields, profitability, and biodiversity conservation as central components of these practices. This study emphasizes that achieving the SDG objectives is attainable through agriculture, which has direct and indirect connections to all SDGs. Geospatial technology plays a vital role in supporting the objectives at spatial and temporal scales by facilitating agricultural practices, ensuring food security, preserving biodiversity, monitoring soil and crop conditions, and promoting sustainable development.

TI  - An agriculture-nutrition intervention improved children's diet and growth in a randomized trial in Ghana.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Stunting in Ghana is associated with rural communities, poverty, and low education; integrated agricultural interventions can address the problem. This cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a 12-month intervention (inputs and training for poultry farming and home gardening, and nutrition and health education) on child diet and nutritional status. Sixteen clusters were identified and randomly assigned to intervention or control; communities within clusters were randomly chosen, and all interested, eligible mother-child pairs were enrolled (intervention: 8 clusters, 19 communities, and 287 households; control: 8 clusters, 20 communities, and 213 households). Intention-to-treat analyses were used to estimate the effect of the intervention on endline minimum diet diversity (≥4 food groups), consumption of eggs, and length-for-age (LAZ)/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length (WLZ)/weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores; standard errors were corrected for clustering. Children were 10.5 ± 5.2 months (range: 0-32) at baseline and 29.8 ± 5.4 months (range: 13-48) at endline. Compared with children in the control group, children in the intervention group met minimum diet diversity (adjusted odds ratio = 1.65, 95% CI [1.02, 2.69]) and a higher LAZ/HAZ (β = 0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.34]) and WAZ (β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.00, 0.30]). Sensitivity analyses with random-effects and mixed-effects models and as-treated analysis were consistent with the findings. There was no group difference in WLZ/WHZ. Integrated interventions that increase access to high-quality foods and nutrition education improve child nutrition.

TI  - Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture: A Systematic Review of Impact Pathways to Nutrition Outcomes.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The role of agriculture in reducing undernutrition is widely recognized, yet there is also consensus on the need to make the sector nutrition-sensitive. Evidence on the impact pathways from nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions, agricultural interventions with specific nutrition objectives, and actions detailing each temporal stage to reach nutrition outcomes is limited, however. We thus synthesized study results regarding impact of NSA interventions on nutrition outcomes relating to undernutrition, and constructed an impact pathway by mapping the evidence on each temporal stage from interventions to nutrition outcomes. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to conduct and report our systematic review of studies on NSA interventions implemented in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Forty-three studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and synthesized across impact and pathways analyses. We carried out a thematic analysis of the effect of NSA interventions using evidence-based indicators and constructed the pathways by adopting a published framework on agriculture to nutrition pathways. Our findings reveal that NSA interventions can significantly improve dietary practices, and have the potential to enhance care practices and reduce occurrence of diseases, indicating their effectiveness in simultaneously addressing multiple determinants of undernutrition. However, NSA interventions have a lesser impact on nutritional status. NSA interventions lead to nutrition outcomes through 5 key pathways: food production, nutrition-related knowledge, agricultural income, women's empowerment, and strengthening of local institutions. We emphasize the need to carefully design, implement, and evaluate interventions with consideration for factors affecting impact pathways. Future research should focus on the effect of interventions combining multisector components, and pathways through non-food-production-related income, women's empowerment, strengthening of local institutions, food prices at intervention level, and expenditure on health care.

TI  - Gender equality, food security and the sustainable development goals
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract This paper examines the potential and limitations of SDG 5 (Gender Equality) in helping to achieve household food security. The potential lies in the attention it pays to women’s access to land and natural resources, which can significantly enhance women’s ability to produce and procure food. Its limitations lie in a lack of attention to the production constraints that women farmers face; its failure to recognise forests and fisheries as key sources of food; and its lack of clarity on which natural resources women need access to and why. Moreover, other goals which bear on food security as important providers of nutrition, such as SDG 15 as it relates to forests and SDG 14 as it relates to fish resources, make no mention of gender equality, nor does SDG 13 (Climate action) recognise the vulnerabilities of women farmers. A bold interpretation of SDG 5 and establishing synergies with other SDGs could provide ways forward. This includes not only SDGs which recognise the importance of gender equality, such as SDGs 1, 2, and 13 on poverty, hunger, and climate change respectively, but also SDGs 14 and 15 whose silence on gender could prove detrimental not just to attaining food security, but also to furthering their stated objectives of resource conservation.

TI  - Group-based approaches to nutrition-sensitive agriculture: insights from a post-project sustainability study in Côte d’Ivoire
PY  - 2021
AB  - There has been considerable interest over the past decade in using nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) to improve food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries, partly due to potentially greater long-term durability of impact compared to nutrition-specific interventions. Group-based approaches to NSA may have particular benefits in terms of increased efficiency and economies of scale. However, very little is known about such approaches’ sustainability—that is, the continued application of promoted practices and activities beyond the initial intervention. This study examines the sustainability of an NGO-sponsored women’s group-based NSA project in Cote d’Ivoire 18 months after project end. We assess the functionality and productivity of a set of gardening and poultry-rearing groups and factors that either enabled or obstructed them from continuing their activities. Quantitative and qualitative fieldwork was undertaken, including a survey of former project participants (n = 277), direct observations at facilities for growing vegetables and raising poultry (n = 12; n = 11), and semi-structured interviews with group members and leaders (n = 48). Results show that the studied gardening groups remained functional, with high rates of membership but lower productivity, production value, and crop diversity. Village-level poultry activities, however, had ended in 9 of 12 villages studied, due to mortality and limited expertise; in the remaining two, they had decreased in scale and productivity. Across both gardening and poultry-rearing, there was a shift from collective to individual approaches to production and towards more marketable products, away from the nutrient-dense ones promoted by the project. Implications for design of future NSA initiatives are discussed.

TI  - Women’s empowerment boosts the gains in dietary diversity from agricultural technology adoption in rural Kenya
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Using new survey data from rural Kenya, this paper assesses the moderating effect of women’s empowerment on the relationship between agricultural technology adoption and women’s dietary diversity. We use a multiple treatment endogenous switching regression framework to control for potential endogeneity of women’s empowerment and technology adoption. We find that women’s empowerment has a positive and significant effect on the women’s dietary diversity score regardless of technology adoption status. We further show that women’s empowerment enhances the positive effects of technology adoption on women’s dietary diversity. Although technology adoption has a positive impact on women’s dietary diversity regardless of empowerment status, its effect is stronger for households with empowered vs. disempowered women. Study results suggest that individual and household welfare could be enhanced to a greater degree through interventions that promote women’s empowerment and technology adoption simultaneously rather than separately.

TI  - The Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of Reproductive Age (MDD-W) Indicator Is Related to Household Food Insecurity and Farm Production Diversity: Evidence from Rural Mali.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background The popularity of nutrition-sensitive interventions calls for high-quality monitoring and evaluation tools. In this context, the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of Reproductive Age (MDD-W), validated as a proxy of micronutrient adequacy, does fill a gap. However, because it is a newly endorsed indicator, information on its linkages with other dimensions of food and nutrition security is still scarce. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate whether the MDD-W is related to household food insecurity and farm production diversity. Methods A cross-sectional survey on a representative sample of 5046 women of reproductive age was conducted in the region of Kayes, Mali, in 2013. Dietary diversity was assessed through qualitative 24-h recall, and MDD-W was computed. MDD-W equaled 1 if the women consumed at least 5 different food groups and 0 otherwise. Food insecurity was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the Household Hunger Scale (HHS), and a farm production diversity score (FPDS) was calculated based on a count of food crops/livestock groups produced. Logistic regressions were used to assess the relation between MDD-W and the indicators of household food security. Results Only 27% of women reached the MDD-W. These women consumed animal source foods and/or vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruits more frequently than did other women. Women from extremely food insecure households (moderate to severe hunger according to the HHS) were less likely to reach the MDD-W (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). One more group in the FPDS increased the odds of attaining the MDD-W (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.18). Conclusion In the rural region of Kayes, Mali, women's dietary diversity, as measured by the MDD-W, was associated with household-level food security indicators. This study was registered at ISRCTN.org as ISRCTN08435964.

TI  - Growth and growth trajectory among infants in early life: contributions of food insecurity and water insecurity in rural Zimbabwe.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="Introduction" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Stunting or linear growth faltering, measured by length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in rural low-income and middle-income countries.

TI  - Effects of an integrated poultry value chain, nutrition, gender and WASH intervention (SELEVER) on hygiene and child morbidity and anthropometry in Burkina Faso: A secondary outcome analysis of a cluster randomised trial.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes have the potential to improve child nutrition outcomes, but livestock intensification may pose risks related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions. We assessed the impact of SELEVER, a nutrition- and gender-sensitive poultry intervention, with and without added WASH focus, on hygiene practices, morbidity and anthropometric indices of nutrition in children aged 2-4 years in Burkina Faso. A 3-year cluster randomised controlled trial was implemented in 120 villages in 60 communes (districts) supported by the SELEVER project. Communes were randomly assigned using restricted randomisation to one of three groups: (1) SELEVER intervention (n = 446 households); (2) SELEVER plus WASH intervention (n = 432 households); and (3) control without intervention (n = 899 households). The study population included women aged 15-49 years with an index child aged 2-4 years. We assessed the effects 1.5-years (WASH substudy) and 3-years (endline) post-intervention on child morbidity and child anthropometry secondary trial outcomes using mixed effects regression models. Participation in intervention activities was low in the SELEVER groups, ranging from 25% at 1.5 years and 10% at endline. At endline, households in the SELEVER groups had higher caregiver knowledge of WASH-livestock risks (∆ = 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.04-0.16]) and were more likely to keep children separated from poultry (∆ = 0.09, 95% CI [0.03-0.15]) than in the control group. No differences were found for other hygiene practices, child morbidity symptoms or anthropometry indicators. Integrating livestock WASH interventions alongside poultry and nutrition interventions can increase knowledge of livestock-related risks and improve livestock-hygiene-related practices, yet may not be sufficient to improve the morbidity and nutritional status of young children.

TI  - The power of the collective empowers women: Evidence from self-help groups in India.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Women’s groups are important rural social and financial institutions in South Asia. In India, a large majority of women’s groups programs are implemented through self-help groups (SHGs). Originally designed as savings and credit groups, the role of SHGs has expanded to include creating health and nutrition awareness, improving governance, and addressing social issues related to gender- and caste-based discrimination. This paper uses panel data from 1470 rural Indian women from five states to study the impact of SHG membership on women’s empowerment in agriculture, using the project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) and the abbreviated Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI). Because SHG membership was not randomized and women who self-select to be SHG members may be systematically different from non-members, we employ nearest neighbor matching methods to attribute the impact of SHG membership on women’s empowerment in agriculture and intrahousehold inequality. Our findings suggest that SHG membership has a significant positive impact on aggregate measures of women’s empowerment and reduces the gap between men’s and women’s empowerment scores. This improvement in aggregate empowerment is driven by improvements in women’s scores, not a deterioration in men’s. Greater control over income, greater decisionmaking over credit, and (somewhat mechanistically, given the treatment) greater and more active involvement in groups within the community lead to improvements in women’s scores. However, impacts on other areas of empowerment are limited. The insignificant impacts on attitudes towards domestic violence and respect within the household suggest that women’s groups alone may be insufficient to change deep-seated gender norms that disempower women. Our results have implications for the design and scale-up of women’s group-based programs in South Asia, including the possibility that involving men is needed to change gender norms.

TI  - NEW ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND ADVISORY SERVICES BASED ON CURRENT FINDINGS AND FURTHER COLLABORATION FOR IMPROVED NUTRITION
PY  - 2019
AB  - Nowadays, there are a number of projects tackling on challenges around which this study is based. For instance, the ultimate goal of the current project SKIN is to create a permanent stakeholders’ association on short food supply chain (SFSC) that works on the joint economic growth of the agricultural sector through the exchange of local food practices and through coaching sessions stimulating innovation. It creates a European network of best practices in SFSC that addresses the fragmentation of knowledge in the agricultural sector and supports bottom-up innovation initiatives. No doubts, boosting innovation through that project in local areas will lead to economic growth in the regions. But, for its sustainable development, it is crucial to create the agricultural extension and advisory services (AEAS), particularly in EU countries and also to modify their role using bottom-up approaches. Despite the fact that the role of AEAS in the EU countries is transforming in the last few years, from a technology transfer paradigm to a demand-driven model, there are still two challenges that should be tackled in the global agenda: 1) facilitate linking of local agricultural sector and nutrition; 2) build a sustainable network of advisors in the EU for improving knowledge flows in national and regional agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS). According also to the findings of the SKIN project and to our recently developed concept (FENIX), the launch of new initiatives will enable AEAS by gathering of a large amount of information and knowledge from local areas and population, helping all types of stakeholders to improve health, environmental, and economic sectors in targeted regions.

TI  - The economics of malnutrition: Dietary transition and food system transformation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Rapid increases in food supplies have reduced global hunger, while rising burdens of diet-related disease have made poor diet quality the leading cause of death and disability around the world. Today's “double burden” of undernourishment in utero and early childhood then undesired weight gain and obesity later in life is accompanied by a third less visible burden of micronutrient imbalances. The triple burden of undernutrition, obesity, and unbalanced micronutrients that underlies many diet-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and other cardiometabolic disorders often coexist in the same person, household and community. All kinds of deprivation are closely linked to food insecurity and poverty, but income growth does not always improve diet quality in part because consumers cannot directly or immediately observe the health consequences of their food options, especially for newly introduced or reformulated items. Even after direct experience and epidemiological evidence reveals relative risks of dietary patterns and nutritional exposures, many consumers may not consume a healthy diet because food choice is driven by other factors. This chapter reviews the evidence on dietary transition and food system transformation during economic development, drawing implications for how research and practice in agricultural economics can improve nutritional outcomes.

TI  - What Influences the Implementation and Sustainability of Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture Interventions? A Case Study from Southern Bangladesh
PY  - 2021
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) provides a promising pathway for addressing malnutrition. Fulfilling this promise needs a better understanding of the implementation and sustainability of NSA interventions because of their highly complex nature. This study aimed to explore the factors affecting the implementation and sustainability of NSA interventions. A case study design was employed using two focus group discussions with beneficiaries (n = 15), semi-structured interviews with beneficiaries (n = 13), and actors involved in implementation (n = 18). Factors were thematically analyzed using both deductive and inductive approaches adapting the consolidated framework for implementation research. A complex interaction of the factors across the five domains was found: outer setting—nutrition sensitivity of policies, institutional framework; inner setting—culture, social and economic environment, biophysical environment, local capacity, other programs or projects; characteristics of actors—beneficiaries, family members, household capacity, implementers; intervention characteristics—adaptability, design quality, cost of interventions; and, implementation process—fit-to-context, integration and multisectoral collaboration, continuous motivation through engagement, monitoring. Implementing and sustaining NSA needs consideration of multiple factors, with careful analysis of the absorptive capacities of local institutions and beneficiary households. Future studies should explore which mechanisms created for adoption can be continued beyond the project funding cycle, and how.

TI  - Reverse thinking: taking a healthy diet perspective towards food systems transformations
PY  - 2021
AB  - Food systems that deliver healthy diets without exceeding the planet’s resources are essential to achieve the worlds’ ambitious development goals. Healthy diets need to be safe, accessible, and affordable for all, including for disadvantaged and nutritionally vulnerable groups such as of smallholder producers, traders, and consumers in low- and middle-income countries. Globally, food systems are experiencing rapid and drastic changes and are failing to fulfil these multiple duties simultaneously. The international community therefore calls for rigorous food systems transformations and policy solutions to support the achievement of healthy diets for all. Most strategies, however, are essentially supply- and market-oriented. Incorporation of a healthy diet perspective in food system transformation is essential to enable food systems to deliver not only on supplying nutritious foods but also on ensuring that consumers have access can afford and desire healthy, sustainable, and culturally acceptable diets. This paper argues that this should be guided by information on diets, dietary trends, consumer motives, and food environment characteristics. Transformational approaches and policies should also take into account the stage of food system development requiring different strategies to ensure healthier diets for consumers. We review current knowledge on drivers of consumer choices at the individual and food environment level with special emphasis on low- and middle income countries, discuss the converging and conflicting objectives that exist among multiple food-system actors, and argue that failure to strengthen synergies and resolve trade-offs may lead to missed opportunities and benefits, or negative unintended consequences in food system outcomes. The paper proposes a menu of promising consumer- and food-environment- oriented policy options to include in the food systems transformation agenda in order to shift LMIC consumer demand towards healthier diets in low- and middle income countries.

TI  - Agricultural Commercialisation and Nutrition in Smallholder Farm Households
PY  - 2019
AB  - Commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is important for rural economic growth. While previous studies have analysed effects of commercialisation on productivity and income, implications for farm household nutrition have received much less attention. We evaluate the effects of commercialisation on household food security and dietary quality with a special focus on calorie and micronutrient consumption. We also examine transmission channels by looking at the role of income, gender, and possible substitution effects between the consumption of own‐produced and purchased foods. The analysis uses survey data from farm households in Kenya and a control function approach. Generalised propensity scores are employed to estimate continuous treatment effects. Commercialisation significantly improves food security and dietary quality in terms of calorie, zinc and iron consumption. For vitamin A, effects are insignificant. Commercialisation contributes to higher incomes and increased nutrients from purchased foods, but it does not reduce the consumption of nutrients from own‐produced foods. Enhancing market access is important not only for rural economic growth, but also for making smallholder agriculture more nutrition‐sensitive.

TI  - Evaluating the Nutritional Properties of Food: A Scoping Review.
PY  - 2022
AB  - There are many methods or indicators used for evaluating the nutritional value of foods; however, it is difficult to accurately reflect the comprehensive nutritional value of a food with a single indicator, and a systematic evaluation system is lacking. In this article, we systematically summarize the common evaluation methods and indicators of the nutritional value of foods. The purpose of this review was to establish an evaluation procedure for nutritional properties of foodstuffs and to help scientists choose more direct and economical evaluation methods according to food types or relevant indicators. The procedure involves the selection of a three-level evaluation method that covers the whole spectrum of a food's nutritional characteristics. It is applicable to scientific research in the fields of agricultural science, food science, nutrition, and so on.

TI  - Spaces for women: Rethinking behavior change communication in the context of women's groups and nutrition-sensitive agriculture.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recently, nutrition-sensitive agriculture programs have taken aim at malnutrition's multi-sectoral roots through re-diversifying agricultural production while integrating women's empowerment and nutrition behavior-change communication components. For these integrated nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs, women-led self-help groups have emerged as promising platforms for program delivery. Yet, while well-designed nutrition behavior-change communication has been successfully used in self-help groups, and is central to nutrition-sensitive agriculture, it can take many forms. These vary widely in their theoretical and ethical underpinnings, communication strategies, and theory of change. As nutrition-sensitive agriculture continues to proliferate, it is critical to better understand how women interact with different behavior-change messages and how to engage individuals in ethical, effective ways. This paper analyzes qualitative data collected from a nutrition-sensitive agricultural project in India that used participatory storytelling to generate knowledge and awareness about malnutrition among women. Drawing from data across two sites, the paper analyzes why certain messages generated more discussion among women then others. We find self-help group women were drawn to topics of early marriage and diet diversity because they emotionally connected to them, and felt they were relevant to their lives with high perceived pay-off and actionability. While other topics on gender and health also provoked emotional, lively discussions, the stories were less effective due to their complexity, which were difficult for volunteer facilitators to communicate. We conclude that there is unmet demand among women in rural India for structured spaces to discuss gendered aspects of health and diet, and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs could benefit from focusing attention here.

TI  - Food Systems as Drivers of Optimal Nutrition and Health: Complexities and Opportunities for Research and Implementation.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are intricately linked to food systems. Addressing challenges in food systems is key to meeting the SDGs in Africa and South Asia, where undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies persist, alongside increased nutrition transition, overweight and obesity, and related chronic diseases. Suboptimal diets are a key risk factor for mortality and 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet; in addition, food systems are not prioritizing environmental sustainability. Optimizing food systems and increasing agricultural productivity beyond calories, to nutrient-rich vegetables and fruits, legumes, and livestock, and sustainable fishing, are required. Strengthening of research around food systems-on pathways, value chains, and development and validation of metrics of diet quality-is required. The development of new technology in crop management and pest control and addressing natural resource degradation is key. Engaging with the public and private sectors, outreach to donors and policymakers, and strengthening cross-disciplinary collaborations are imperative to improving food systems.

TI  - Farming System for Nutrition-a pathway to dietary diversity: Evidence from India.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Farming is the main livelihood of a majority of people in India. The country is also home to a large population of undernourished people. This indicates potential for mainstreaming the nutrition dimension in the farming system to impact on nutrition outcomes. A Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) study was conducted in two agro-ecologically different locations from 2013-2018, to explore the feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. The baseline survey in 2013-2014 revealed that the population in the study area was largely undernourished and that household diets were cereal-dominated. The FSN model was designed in consultation with community members, to increase availability of nutrient-dense cereals and pulses, by enhancing production and crop diversification at the farm level, promoting cultivation of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in nutrition gardens and supporting interventions to promote access to animal foods. Nutrition awareness initiatives were undertaken to build capacity at the local level and translate production diversity to consumption diversity. An endline survey was conducted in 2017 (July-October), following three years of intervention. Crop, vegetable and animal food production and food consumption was compared with the baseline data. There was evidence of higher production and consumption of nutrient rich foods, improved household dietary diversity; and understanding and acceptance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The number of items consumed under each food group, frequency of consumption of food and average per capita intake of nutrient-rich foods were found to have improved. The results provide evidence regarding feasibility of location-specific FSN models to promote sustainable and healthy diets, using locally available plant and animal food resources, to address nutrition deficiencies in farm families.

TI  - Innovative and Sustainable Food Production and Food Consumption Entrepreneurship: A Conceptual Recipe for Delivering Development Success in South Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Innovative food production and food consumption entrepreneurship can be viewed as a recipe for delivering sustainable development goals to promote economic, human, and community growth among vulnerable and marginalised communities in South Africa (SA). This study critically analyses the trends and related issues perpetuating the development gap between privileged and marginalised communities in SA. It explores the link between innovative food production and food consumption entrepreneurship and underdevelopment based on sustainable development goals (SDGs). The study also generates a conceptual model designed to bridge the development gap between privileged and marginalised communities in SA. Philosophically, an interpretivism research paradigm based on the socialised interpretation of extant literature is pursued. Consistent with this stance, an inductive approach and qualitative methodological choices are applied using a combination of thematic analysis and grounded theory to generate research data. Grounded theory techniques determine the extent to which the literature review readings are simultaneously pursued, analysed, and conceptualised to generate the conceptual model. Research findings highlight the perpetual inequality in land distribution, economic and employability status, social mobility, gender equity, education, emancipation, empowerment, and quality of life between privileged and marginalised societies in SA. Underdevelopment issues such as poverty, unemployment, hunger, criminal activities, therefore, characterise marginalised communities and are linked to SDGs. Arguably, food production and food consumption entrepreneurship are ideally positioned to address underdevelopment by creating job opportunities, generating income, transforming the economic status, social mobility, and quality of life. Although such entrepreneurship development initiatives in SA are acknowledged, their impact remains insignificant because the interventions are traditionally prescriptive, fragmented, linear, and foreign-driven. A robust, contextualised, integrated, and transformative approach is developed based on the conceptual model designed to create a sustainable, innovative, and digital entrepreneurship development plan that will be executed to yield employment, generate income and address poverty, hunger, gender inequity. To bridge the gap between privileged and marginalised societies. The conceptual model will be used to bridge the perpetual development gap between privileged and marginalised societies. In SA is generated. Recommended future research directions include implementing, testing, and validating the model from a practical perspective through a specific project within selected marginalised communities.

TI  - Economic evaluation of an early childhood development center–based agriculture and nutrition intervention in Malawi
PY  - 2021
AB  - Malnutrition is a leading cause of death and disability among children in low-income countries. Nutrition-sensitive interventions show promise in increasing food access and improving diets. There are possible synergies of integrating these programs with other sectors, improving effectiveness by leveraging resources. However, economic evaluations of these multi-sectoral programs are limited. We aimed to estimate the cost efficiency, cost-effectiveness, benefit-cost ratio, and net benefit of using community-based early childhood development (ECD) centers as platforms for an intervention promoting agricultural production and nutrition among households with young children in Malawi. The intervention was costed using bottom-up micro-costing and top-down expenditure analysis with a societal perspective and a 12-month horizon. Effectiveness estimates were derived from a cluster-randomized control trial. Premature deaths and stunting cases averted were estimated using the Lived Saved Tool. We calculated DALYs averted, and the value of three benefits streams resulting from reductions in premature mortality, increases in lifetime productivity and household agricultural productivity. We transferred the US value of a statistical life (VSL) to Malawi using an income elasticity of 1.5, and a 10% discount rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using a Monte Carlo model. The intervention cost $197,377, reaching 4,806 beneficiaries at $41 per beneficiary, $595 per case of stunting, $18,310 per death, and $516 per DALY averted. Net benefit estimates ranged from $507,589 to $4,678,258, and benefit-cost ratios from 3.57 to 24.70. Sensitivity analyses confirmed a positive return on investment. Implementing agriculture-nutrition interventions through ECD platforms may be an efficient use of resources in Malawi and similar contexts.

TI  - Women as Drivers of Change for Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture: Case Study of a Novel Extension Approach in Wardha, India
PY  - 2018
AB  - What can a case study of an initiative for empowerment of women farmers tell us about nutrition-sensitive agriculture? Through this case study, the paper highlights how women farmers act as drivers of change and manage to bring about production and consumption diversity, even in a cash crop growing region; how women farmers’ groups serve as important social networks in aiding the spread of these changes; and how bundling of women’s empowerment programmes with agricultural extension has the potential to promote nutrition-sensitive farming. The spread of mixed cropping practices among women farmers was crucially related to the context-specific technical guidance that was provided. Women farmers adopted different cropping pattern designs, integrating pulses, millets and vegetables with cotton/soyabean as main crops. They perceived tangible benefits in terms of enhanced availability of food grains and vegetables for household consumption through mixed cropping practices. The paper brings to light the need for the State to strengthen the agricultural extension system for scaling up nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices among small farmers.

TI  - Seasonality and nutrition-sensitive farming in rural Northern Ghana.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText>In rural sub-Saharan Africa, where malnutrition in all its forms is rife, the greatest gap between the availability of foods and the foods needed for a nutritious diet are faced during the 'hunger season'. We investigated what rural households in Northern Ghana would need to grow to ensure year-round availability of a nutrient adequate diet or the income required to fulfil their dietary needs. We applied linear programming to model different scenarios and interventions. Our results provide three major insights. First, considering seasonality is crucial in nutrition-sensitive farming. Ensuring a nutritious diet year-round requires enhanced availability of vegetables and fruits throughout the year. Second, although staple crops do not provide the full range of essential nutrients, increasing their yields allows for a reduction of field size, freeing up space for the production of other foods belonging to a nutritious diet, such as vegetables. Third, small farms are unable to produce sufficient food to cover their needs. They depend on income both from agriculture and other sources, and the availability of types of foods on markets to meet their dietary needs. Our study shows the value of modelling the range of dietary effects from agricultural interventions in a specific context, using a local feasible nutritious diet as a starting point and taking seasonality into account.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Supplementary Information" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12571-022-01325-5.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Factors Affecting Food Security among Households in Nigeria: The Role of Crop Diversity
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Agriculture is central in order to achieve nutrition goals through the provision of food, energy and essential micronutrients for the physical and mental development of humans. Dietary diversity is a good indicator of human food security status. Using a dataset obtained from the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study—Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), this paper examines the linkages between crop diversity and food security (measured as dietary diversity) among farming households in Nigeria using ordinary least squares, Poisson regression, and instrumental variables (IV) Poisson regression to estimate the relationship. In addition, we investigate the determinants that lead to the consumption of each food groups considered for generating dietary diversity using a logit regression model. The results show that food expenditure, asset ownership and location of households are the key factors driving the types of food consumed by the households. Furthermore, increased food expenditure and access to credit were found to positively influence food security. The result established a positive and significant relationship between crop diversity and dietary diversity. Our findings call for more attention to diet diversity, as well as the need to harmonize the roles of rural income improvement, especially through non-farm livelihood diversification in tackling multiple nutritional deficiencies in Nigeria.</jats:p>

TI  - Research and innovation as a catalyst for food system transformation.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Background Food systems are associated with severe and persistent problems worldwide. Governance approaches aiming to foster sustainable transformation of food systems face several challenges due to the complex nature of food systems. Scope and approach In this commentary we argue that addressing these governance challenges requires the development and adoption of novel research and innovation (R&I) approaches that will provide evidence to inform food system transformation and will serve as catalysts for change. We first elaborate on the complexity of food systems (transformation) and stress the need to move beyond traditional linear R&I approaches to be able to respond to persistent problems that affect food systems. Though integrated transdisciplinary approaches are promising, current R&I systems do not sufficiently support such endeavors. As such, we argue, we need strategies that trigger a double transformation – of food systems and of their R&I systems. Key Findings and Conclusions Seizing the opportunities to transform R&I systems has implications for how research is done – pointing to the need for competence development among researchers, policy makers and society in general – and requires specific governance interventions that stimulate a systemic approach. Such interventions should foster transdisciplinary and transformative research agendas that stimulate portfolios of projects that will reinforce one another, and stimulate innovative experiments to shape conditions for systemic change. In short, a thorough rethinking of the role of R&I as well as how it is funded is a crucial step towards the development of the integrative policies that are necessary to engender systemic change – in the food system and beyond.

TI  - A model-based exploration of farm-household livelihood and nutrition indicators to guide nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Assessing progress towards healthier people, farms and landscapes through nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) requires transdisciplinary methods with robust models and metrics. Farm-household models could facilitate disentangling the complex agriculture-nutrition nexus, by jointly assessing performance indicators on different farm system components such as farm productivity, farm environmental performance, household nutrition, and livelihoods. We, therefore, applied a farm-household model, FarmDESIGN, expanded to more comprehensively capture household nutrition and production diversity, diet diversity, and nutrient adequacy metrics. We estimated the potential contribution of an NSA intervention targeting the diversification of home gardens, aimed at reducing nutritional gaps and improving livelihoods in rural Vietnam. We addressed three central questions: (1) Do ‘Selected Crops’ (i.e. crops identified in a participatory process) in the intervention contribute to satisfying household dietary requirements?; (2) Does the adoption of Selected Crops contribute to improving household livelihoods (i.e. does it increase leisure time for non-earning activities as well as the dispensable budget)?; and (3) Do the proposed nutrition-related metrics estimate the contribution of home-garden diversification towards satisfying household dietary requirements? Results indicate trade-offs between nutrition and dispensable budget, with limited farm-household configurations leading to jointly improved nutrition and livelihoods. FarmDESIGN facilitated testing the robustness and limitations of commonly used metrics to monitor progress towards NSA. Results indicate that most of the production diversity metrics performed poorly at predicting desirable nutritional outcomes in this modelling study. This study demonstrates that farm-household models can facilitate anticipating the effect (positive or negative) of agricultural interventions on nutrition and the environment, identifying complementary interventions for significant and positive results and helping to foresee the trade-offs that farm-households could face. Furthermore, FarmDESIGN could contribute to identifying agreed-upon and robust metrics for measuring nutritional outcomes at the farm-household level, to allow comparability between contexts and NSA interventions.

TI  - Formative Research to Inform Market-Based Interventions to Increase Egg Purchase and Consumption in Tigray, Ethiopia.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Animal source foods (ASFs) have a demonstrated ability to improve child health yet are underutilized by many communities faced with malnutrition. Recognizing that improving knowledge about the benefits of consuming ASFs alone is not adequate to change behavior, the Studying Animal Food Markets in Rural Areas (SAFIRA) pilot project planned to test a market-based intervention to increasing the intake of ASFs by children 6-23 months in rural Tigray, Ethiopia. Our process of designing in-market behavior change strategies involved identifying the project's target ASF, cocreating and testing marketing interventions, and understanding barriers and enablers driving key retailer behaviors. Qualitative research methods including focus group discussions, key informant interviews, trials of improved practices, and transect walks were used throughout 2 rounds of formative research. The first round of formative research led the project to focus on eggs, and the second round resulted in an improved understanding of the Tigrayan local food markets and egg consumption. Consumers were receptive to nutrition messaging from trusted community members and consider eggs to be healthy and affordable relative to other ASFs. Despite a willingness on the part of egg retailers in Tigrayan markets to try new practices to market eggs to consumers, formative research revealed that retailers function primarily as aggregators, moving eggs toward urban markets, correcting a foundational assumption that households routinely purchase eggs at local markets. These findings demonstrate the importance of formative research to inform design-especially in the development of context-specific behavior change interventions situated within local marketplaces.

TI  - Understanding the effects of nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions with participatory videos and women's group meetings on maternal and child nutrition in rural Odisha, India: A mixed-methods process evaluation.
PY  - 2022
AB  - A trial of three nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions with participatory videos and women's group meetings in rural Odisha, India, found improvements in maternal and child dietary diversity, limited effects on agricultural production, and no effects on women and children's nutritional status. Our process evaluation explored fidelity, reach, and mechanisms behind interventions' effects. We also examined how context affected implementation, mechanisms, and outcomes. We used data from intervention monitoring systems, review notes, trial surveys, 32 case studies with families (n = 91 family members), and 20 group discussions with women's group members and intervention workers (n = 181 and 32, respectively). We found that interventions were implemented with high fidelity. Groups reached around half of the mothers of children under 2 years. Videos and meetings increased women's knowledge, motivation and confidence to suggest or make changes to their diets and agricultural production. Families responded in diverse ways. Many adopted or improved rainfed homestead garden cultivation for consumption, which could explain gains in maternal and child dietary diversity seen in the impact evaluation. Cultivation for income was less common. This was often due to small landholdings, poor access to irrigation and decision-making dominated by men. Interventions helped change norms about heavy work during pregnancy, but young women with little family support still did considerable work. Women's ability to shape cultivation, income and workload decisions was strongly influenced by support from male relatives. Future nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions could include additional flexibility to address families' land, water, labour and time constraints, as well as actively engage with spouses and in-laws.

TI  - Subsistence production, markets, and dietary diversity in the Kenyan small farm sector
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Undernutrition and low dietary quality remain widespread problems in poor population segments, especially among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, the question how smallholder systems can be made more nutrition-sensitive is of particular relevance for research and policy. Recent studies analyzed whether increasing farm production diversity may help to improve nutrition. Most existing studies found a positive but small effect on dietary diversity on average. The underlying mechanisms were not examined in detail. This article tests the hypothesis that the effect of farm diversity on nutrition is small because production diversity is positively associated with dietary diversity obtained from subsistence production but negatively associated with dietary diversity obtained from the market. This hypothesis is confirmed with data from Kenya, using different indicators of production diversity and dietary diversity scores at household and individual levels. The results underline the important role of markets for smallholder diets and nutrition. Hence, strengthening markets and improving market access should be a key strategy to make smallholder systems more nutrition-sensitive.

TI  - Considerations for the design of nutrition-sensitive production programmes in rural South Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Very little has been researched about the efficacy, effectiveness, feasibility, sustainability and impact of food-based approaches on the diets and nutritional status of populations at risk of hunger and food insecurity. This study contributes knowledge about the impact of food-based approaches on the diets of populations at risk of hunger and food insecurity in four of the poorest rural communities in South Africa. The study investigated the consumption and production patterns of rural households (278 in summer and 280 in winter) in four sites in the poorest municipalities in South Africa. A multistage stratified random sampling technique was applied to identify the communities and sample households for the quantitative survey and qualitative assessments. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected between 2013 and 2015 through focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews and the two-round panel survey to cover both the summer and winter seasons at each site. Home gardening led to a significant positive increase in the consumption of white roots and tubers, dark green leafy vegetables, orange-coloured fruit and other fruit in the 24 h prior to the survey. Participation in a community garden led to significant increases in the consumption of dark green leafy vegetables and other vegetables. School gardening did not demonstrate any statistical relationships with the consumption of foods from the crop-related food groups. Crop production improved dietary diversity. Selling produce and irrigation showed a stronger improvement in dietary diversity. Seasonality affected the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables for home consumption in winter. Producing beyond that solely for home consumption has greater benefits for dietary diversity and a consumption-smoothing effect during the post-harvest period. Politicians and the scientific community should recognise the role that household and small-scale crop production plays in supporting household consumption and the provision of essential micronutrients despite constraints and disincentives. Production and education programmes should focus on strengthening existing good consumption patterns and promoting the consumption of foods that can improve dietary diversity.

TI  - Community perspectives on food security and dietary diversity among rural smallholder farmers: A qualitative study in central Uganda
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Smallholder farmers produce majority of food in developing countries yet continue to be vulnerable to poverty, food insecurity, limited diet quality and diversity, malnutrition, and face various production challenges. Though quantitative studies have explored determinants of dietary diversity among farmers, this data can be further enriched with farmer experiences and perspectives of whether and how these factors affect dietary diversity to inform intervention design and implementation. A qualitative study was conducted among rural smallholder farmers in Kiboga district, Central Uganda with 28 participants in eight focus group discussions (four groups with men and four groups with women). The results showed that both men and women were concerned about food security and dietary diversity and viewed household food production as pivotal to food security. Purchase of food was affected by prices, household income, distance to markets and food diversity in the accessed markets. Major determinants of dietary diversity included household food production, agricultural and nutrition knowledge and awareness, information access and use, household income, and time. Poor perception towards meetings, insufficient nutrition information, skills and training were also noted. Gender influences and differences noted were concerned with allocation and use of harvested food and income within the household; more men than women having a poor perception towards meetings/trainings; and women having limited time for agricultural and nutrition practices that support dietary diversity. From the results, efforts to improve dietary diversity should address the food security and production challenges faced; support income generation whether on- or off-farm and market access to diverse foods; use designs that address gender issues and are labor and time sensitive; and include capacity building in nutrition and practices that support access to and utilization of diverse food baskets, and social behavior change strategies.

TI  - Rural production of tropically adapted breeds of chickens in rural areas of Kwara state, Nigeria
PY  - 2019
AB  - Chicken keeping is a common thing with most household in rural areas of Nigeria. The birds are raised under extensive system of production with little or no feed provided by the farmers for the birds, hence there is the need to compare the rate of egg production of six different breeds of chickens reared under the same conditions in the rural areas. Twelve villages were randomly selected from the long list of villages in Kwara, 20 households per village and 4 villages per senatorial district, with a total coverage of 240 households for the study. The birds that were used for the study were indigenous chicken (Fulani), improved indigenous chickens (Shika Brown, Funaab Alpha and Noiler) and imported tropically adapted birds (Sasso and Kuroiler). Thirty six weeks old pre-vaccinated and brooded chickens of different breeds given to the farmers were managed under the traditional poultry scavenging system in all the three senatorial districts. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the comparison between districts and breeds. There were no significant differences in egg production per senatorial district, egg production from different breeds and production from different senatorial districts remained averagely low. Low egg production by all the breeds showed that scavenging way of rural chicken production should be improved on for better productivity. This can be achieved through supplemental feed formulated and produced from locally available feed ingredients for the chickens.

AB  - Introduction : Madagascar a adopte des strategies de lutte contre la malnutrition maternelle depuis plusieurs annees, mais l’evaluation de leur mise en œuvre n’est pas effective.But de l’etude : La presente etude vise a decrire l’appreciation par les beneficiaires des interventions visant a lutter contre la malnutrition maternelle et a identifier leurs attentes.Methode : Une etude qualitative a ete menee dans la region d’Amoron’i Mania a Madagascar. La population d’etude etait constituee par des meres d’enfants âges de moins de 5 ans, des femmes enceintes ainsi que d’autres membres de la famille et de la communaute (peres de famille, grand-meres, matrones et agents communautaires). Six focus groups et 16 entretiens individuels ont ete realises pour collecter les donnees dont le traitement a ete realise en utilisant la methode d’analyse thematique.Resultats : L’aide alimentaire, l’amelioration de la production de l’agriculture et de l’elevage et l’education nutritionnelle operees par les ONG constituent les interventions les plus connues. Les centres de sante n’ont pas ete cites comme intervenant et leurs interventions ont ete meconnues. L’efficacite de l’intervention etait jugee generalement sur les avantages percus par les beneficiaires. Les intervenants qui œuvraient par projet ont ete estimes non perennes. Deux principaux problemes ont ete evoques, l’insuffisance de la production agricole entrainant l’inaccessibilite des ingredients qu’exigent l’education nutritionnelle et la faible couverture des interventions. L’amelioration de la production agricole constitue la principale suggestion evoquee pour lutter contre la malnutrition maternelle.Conclusions : Les beneficiaires ont estime que les interventions existantes dans la region etaient insuffisantes pour resoudre le probleme de malnutrition chez les meres.

TI  - Food Sources and Dietary Quality in Small Island Developing States: Development of Methods and Policy Relevant Novel Survey Data from the Pacific and Caribbean
PY  - 2020
AB  - Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have high and increasing rates of diet-related diseases. This situation is associated with a loss of food sovereignty and an increasing reliance on nutritionally poor food imports. A policy goal, therefore, is to improve local diets through improved local production of nutritious foods. Our aim in this study was to develop methods and collect preliminary data on the relationships between where people source their food, their socio-demographic characteristics and dietary quality in Fiji and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) in order to inform further work towards this policy goal. We developed a toolkit of methods to collect individual-level data, including measures of dietary intake, food sources, socio-demographic and health indicators. Individuals aged ≥15 years were eligible to participate. From purposively sampled urban and rural areas, we recruited 186 individuals from 95 households in Fiji, and 147 individuals from 86 households in SVG. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to investigate associations. The mean dietary diversity score, out of 10, was 3.7 (SD1.4) in Fiji and 3.8 (SD1.5) in SVG. In both settings, purchasing was the most common way of sourcing food. However, 68% (Fiji) and 45% (SVG) of participants regularly (>weekly) consumed their own produce, and 5% (Fiji) and 33% (SVG) regularly consumed borrowed/exchanged/bartered food. In regression models, independent positive associations with dietary diversity (DD) were: borrowing/exchanging/bartering food (β = 0.73 (0.21, 1.25)); age (0.01 (0.00, 0.03)); and greater than primary education (0.44 (0.06, 0.82)). DD was negatively associated with small shop purchasing (-0.52 (95% CIs -0.91, -0.12)) and rural residence (-0.46 (-0.92, 0.00)). The findings highlight associations between dietary diversity and food sources and indicate avenues for further research to inform policy actions aimed at improving local food production and diet.

TI  - Digesting agriculture development: nutrition-oriented development and the political ecology of rice–body relations in India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) has emerged as a major development paradigm that works to diversify crops and diets throughout the Global South in order to improve nutritional outcomes. Drawing on a conceptual framework from political ecologies of health that looks at political economic factors, social discourse, and embodied, material experiences of food, I analyze qualitative and ethnographic data from an integrated NSA intervention in Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, India. The analysis shows that while embodied experiences of differing rice varieties (either indigenous or improved) were central to research participants’ conceptions of bodily health, mainstream NSA metrics had trouble ‘seeing’ these relations in meaningful ways. Moreover, although material experiences of rice cultivation and consumption anchored participants’ rice preferences, structural economic realities along with notions of social identity were always interwoven. Yet, while villagers expressed divergent perceptions around how the different rice cultivars shaped their bodily health, agricultural officers tended to view rice experiences as a product of culture, rather than as material and socio-ecological food-body interactions. In sum, this paper argues more deeply engaging with the political economic, socially symbolic, and embodied ways that communities relate to food production and consumption would allow NSA research to develop more grounded and inclusive understandings of agriculture-nutrition linkages.

TI  - Marginal more than mesic sites benefit from groundnut diversification of maize: Increased yield, protein, stability, and profits
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Sustainable Intensification (SI) interventions are urgently required, particularly those suited to resource poor farms in Africa. Legume crops have been promoted as a key ingredient for SI of rainfed grain production on smallholder farms, with variable results. There is a need to explore the extent to which legume diversification of maize production impacts stability, nutrition, and income. This is particularly so for marginal environments. On-farm experimentation was conducted in Central Malawi over two to seven years on 29 farm sites (120 year-site combinations). The farms were located within four areas that included lakeshore, dissected hills (two locations) and upland plain. Maize diversification included a long-duration legume pigeonpea and a medium duration legume groundnut, grown in rotation or intercropped with maize, and as a doubled-up legume rotation (DLR). To quantify the performance of systems under low, medium, and high yield environments, we used long-term average maize yield to categorize each farm site. All legume diversified systems supported stable grain production in the low yield environment, as shown by 37–41% coefficient of variation for yield, in comparison to 62% for sole maize. The groundnut systems consistently produced the highest grain yield, protein, stable yields, and economic returns, and this performance held up in marginal, low yield environments. In this multi-site, multi-year, on-farm replicated study, the performance of groundnut systems (GnRot and DLR) stood out for high protein (0.529 T ha−1 2 yr−1 and 0.615 T ha −1 2 yr−1, respectively over two years) versus unfertilized maize (0.169 T ha−1 2 yr−1). These two groundnut-based systems were produced with half-fertilizer rates compared to sole maize and were economically high performers. However, there was a barrier to adoption of GnRot and DLR in that improved groundnut seed was expensive (USD 157 ha−1 2 yr−1), this initial investment being beyond the means of many farmers, despite the cost largely offset by the generation of high income (USD 1636–1993 ha−1 2 yr−1). Long-term sustainability was assessed by monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC), which was found to be markedly influenced by soil texture (sites with SOC >1.5% had sand content

TI  - Inland fisheries critical for the diet quality of young children in sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The world will not reach Sustainable Development Goal 2 ‘Zero Hunger’ by 2030 unless we address micronutrient deficiencies, particularly amongst infants and children in developing countries. Fish are nutrient-rich and are valued to improve diet quality. We examined the diets of 6328 children in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Most children had inadequate diet diversity. Of those that did have higher diet diversity, 20% relied on eating fish from nearby inland fisheries as their only flesh food. Results suggest that food systems failed to provide fish or other flesh foods to 65% of rural children. To improve diet quality of children living more than 5 km from inland fisheries, strategies are needed to extend the reach of fish value chains and improve access to fish.

TI  - The Global Nutrient Database: availability of macronutrients and micronutrients in 195 countries from 1980 to 2013.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Summary Background Few data are available on the supply and consumption of nutrients at the country level. To address this data gap, we aimed to create a database that provides information on availability (ie, supply) of 156 nutrients across 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2013. Methods We matched 394 food and agricultural commodities from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Supply and Utilization Accounts (SUAs) to food items in the United States Department of Agriculture Food Composition Database and obtained data on nutrient composition of the SUAs' food items. Then, after adjusting for inedible portion of each food item, we added the contributions of individual food items to the availability of each nutrient and estimated the national availability of macronutrients and micronutrients in each year. We validated our estimates by comparing our results with those of national nutrition surveys from three countries (the USA, South Korea, and Ecuador). Using dietary consumption data from the Global Burden of Disease study and two popular machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost [extreme gradient boosting]), we developed predictive models to estimate the consumption of each nutrient based on their national availability. Findings Globally 2710 kcal (95% UI 2660–2770) were available per person per day in 2013. Carbohydrates were the major contributor to energy availability (70·5%), followed by fats (17·4%), and protein (10·5%). The energy availability and the contribution of macronutrients to total energy widely varied across levels of development. Countries at the higher level of development (high Socio-demographic Index countries) had more energy available per person per day (3270 kcal, 3220–3310); greater contributions from fats (26·0%) and proteins (11·9%) to total energy availability; and lower contributions from carbohydrate (54·8%). During 1980–2013, energy availability and the contributions of protein and fats to energy availability have increased globally and across levels of development while the contribution of carbohydrates to total energy availability has decreased. The supply of the micronutrients has also increased during the same period globally and across levels of development. Our validation analysis showed that, after accounting for waste at the retail and household level, our estimates of macronutrient availability were very close to the consumption data in nationally representative surveys. Our machine-learning models closely predicted the observed intake of nutrients with the out-of-sample correlation of greater than 0·8 between predicted and observed intake for the nutrients included in the analysis. Interpretation Our global nutrient database provides a picture of the supply of various nutrients at the country level and can be useful to assess the performance of national food systems in addressing the nutritional needs of their population.

TI  - Home gardens, household nutrition and income in rural farm households in Odisha, India
PY  - 2023
AB  - Home gardens have been an integral part of the recent food-based interventions aimed at stimulating changes in dietary patterns and improving nutrition. However, evidence of their effects on food security, dietary quality, child anthropometry and incomes is limited, particularly among vulnerable populations groups. Using panel data from a sample of approximately 1900 households from vulnerable population groups in Odisha, India, difference-in-differences and other econometric techniques, we analyse the effects of home gardens on food security, dietary quality, child anthropometry and income. On average, home gardens contribute to better household food security, higher dietary quality of men and women but do not contribute to higher children's dietary quality and anthropometry. Also, home gardens increase monthly per adult equivalent incomes by 37% and reduce the prevalence of poverty by 11.7 percentage points. Quantile regression results suggest that home gardens enhance food security and incomes in all quantiles, but richer farmers benefit more than poorer farmers. Overall, home gardens can enhance household food security, dietary quality of men and women, and income gains among vulnerable farming population groups, but they may not suffice to improve child dietary quality and anthropometry.

TI  - Protocol for the cost-consequence and equity impact analyses of a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing three variants of a nutrition-sensitive agricultural extension intervention to improve maternal and child dietary diversity and nutritional status in rural Odisha, India (UPAVAN trial)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Undernutrition causes around 3.1 million child deaths annually, around 45% of all child deaths. India has one of the highest proportions of maternal and child undernutrition globally. To accelerate reductions in undernutrition, nutrition-specific interventions need to be coupled with nutrition-sensitive programmes that tackle the underlying causes of undernutrition. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of the UPAVAN trial, a four-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial that tests the nutritional and agricultural impacts of an innovative agriculture extension platform of women’s groups viewing videos on nutrition-sensitive agriculture practices, coupled with a nutrition-specific behaviour-change intervention of videos on nutrition, and a participatory learning and action approach. The economic evaluation of the UPAVAN interventions will be conducted from a societal perspective, taking into account all costs incurred by the implementing agency (programme costs), community and health care providers, and participants and their households, and all measurable outcomes associated with the interventions. All direct and indirect costs, including time costs and donated goods, will be estimated. The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-consequence analysis, comparing incremental costs and incremental changes in the outcomes of the interventions, compared with the status quo. Robustness of the results will be assessed through a series of sensitivity analyses. In addition, an analysis of the equity impact of the interventions will be conducted. Evidence on the cost and cost-effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions is scarce. This limits understanding of the costs of rolling out or scaling up programs. The findings of this economic evaluation will provide useful information for different multisectoral stakeholders involved in the planning and implementation of nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes.

TI  - Connecting the food and agriculture sector to nutrition interventions for improved health outcomes.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText>To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger, multi-sectoral strategies to improve nutrition are necessary. Building towards this goal, the food and agriculture sector must be considered when designing nutritional interventions. Nevertheless, most frameworks designed to guide nutritional interventions do not adequately capture opportunities for integrating nutrition interventions within the food and agriculture sector. This paper aims to highlight how deeply connected the food and agriculture sector is to underlying causes of malnutrition and identify opportunities to better integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition in low and middle income countries. In particular, this paper: (1) expands on the UNICEF conceptual framework for undernutrition to integrate the food and agriculture sector and nutrition outcomes, (2) identifies how nutritional outcomes and agriculture are linked in six important ways by defining evidence-based food and agriculture system components within these pathways: as a source of food, as a source of income, through food prices, women's empowerment, women's utilization of time, and women's health and nutritional status, and (3) shows that the food and agriculture sector facilitates interventions through production, processing and consumption, as well as through farmer practices and behavior. Current frameworks used to guide nutrition interventions are designed from a health sector paradigm, leaving agricultural aspects not sufficiently leveraged. This paper concludes by proposing intervention opportunities to rectify the missed opportunities generated by this approach. Program design should consider the ways that the food and agriculture sector is linked to other critical sectors to comprehensively address malnutrition. This framework is designed to help the user to begin to identify intervention sites that may be considered when planning and implementing multi-sectoral nutrition programs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="Supplementary Information" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12571-022-01262-3.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Does homestead livestock production and ownership contribute to consumption of animal source foods? A pre-intervention assessment of rural farming communities in Tanzania
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Livestock production at homestead level is widely reported as an important pathway to achieve optimal consumption of Animal Source Foods (ASF) in a household. However, the empirical evidence is limited. This paper examines the extent of homestead livestock production and consumption of ASF by rural farming communities in four villages of Dodoma and Morogoro regions, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey of 663 households was carried out. Interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) with mothers and caregivers sought to understand livestock production and consumption patterns of ASF. Analysis techniques included Chi-square test, ANOVA and binary regression. Animal source foods were grouped into four categories; (i) meat and meat products, (ii) eggs, (iii) fish, sardines and sea foods, and (iv) milk and dairy products. The average intake of ASF was low for the entire sample, with only 26% of the population consuming at least one of the four types, even though more than half (52.5%) of the surveyed households reported to keep livestock. Generally, proportion of livestock keepers consuming ASF was slightly higher compared to their counterparts. Results from chi-square test indicated that, Dodoma households were more likely to consume meat (χ2 (1) = 11.1, p = 0.000) and milk (χ2 (1) = 10.8, p = 0.000) than Morogoro households (χ2 (1) = 0.2, p = 0.627 and χ2 (1) = 0.02, p = 0.887). Notably consumption of fish and sardines prevailed more in Morogoro than Dodoma households. Keeping of livestock was further emerged as a significant predictor for consumption of ASF after controlling for demographic factors (p

TI  - Reducing food insecurity through equitable investments in irrigation: The case of Niger
PY  - 2022
AB  - We use Niger as a case study to examine the relationship between irrigation and household food security controlling for the point of crop harvest sales. We use longitudinal household and agriculture data collected by the Living Standards Measurement Study. Using panel fixed effects, we find that irrigation was associated with a 10% decrease in food insecurity, a 9% increase in food consumption expenditure, and improved dietary diversity. Farmers using irrigation experienced higher cash incomes, sold a higher share of the harvest, and had higher crop revenues. Access to irrigation was also positively correlated with the consumption of nutritious food items such as fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Importantly, these effects were found for both farmers using irrigation that primarily sold their harvest locally to neighbors and village shops, as well as for farmers using irrigation who sold in bulk to regional or national traders. Results suggest that investing in irrigation can improve food security, even in areas with limited access to formal markets.

TI  - Agricultural production diversity and child nutrition in Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study investigates how two aspects of agricultural production diversity – farm production diversity and composition of production – relate to child height-for-age and weight-for-height in Ethiopia. We use longitudinal data on child anthropometric measurements, household farm production diversity and farm production composition from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey for 2011, 2013, and 2015 available through the World Bank. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we show that an increase in farm production diversity reduces the risk of chronic food insecurity (child height-for-age) but has no impact on acute measures of food insecurity (child weight-for-height). Results also suggest that, in a context of poor rainfall, more diversity in farm production can adversely impact child height-for-age, although livestock sales might mitigate that detrimental effect. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between farm-level food production and child nutrition in a context of climate change.

TI  - Agriculture-Nutrition Linkages, Cooking-Time, Intrahousehold Equality Among Women and Children: Evidence from Tajikistan
PY  - 2019
AB  - Household-level agriculture-nutrition linkage (ANL) tends to be strong where food markets are imperfect. In such an environment, markets for cooking services may also be imperfect. Nutrition outcomes of household members, including intrahousehold inequality among women and children can depend on a household’s self-production of food and cooking services, provided both by household labors, particularly of women. Using the primary data in Tajikistan, we show that longer cooking-time by women in the household often strengthens household-level ANL and also reduces intrahousehold inequality in nutritional outcomes among women and children. These effects are stronger in areas with lower nighttime light intensity and for households with lower values of cooking assets. In a context where household-level ANL is strong, ANL may also depend on households’ self-production of complementary inputs, including cooking services. This dependence reveals both unique opportunities for and vulnerabilities of ANL for the rural poor.

TI  - Ensuring Access to Safe and Nutritious Food for All Through the Transformation of Food Systems
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Action Track 1 of the Food Systems Summit offers an opportunity to bring together the crucial elements of food safety, nutrition, poverty and inequalities in the framework of food systems within the context of climate and environmental change to ensure that all people have access to a safe and nutritious diet. Achieving Action Track 1’s goal is essential to achieving the goals of the other Action Tracks. With less than a decade left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most countries are not on a course to hit either the World Health Organisation’s nutrition targets or the SDG 2 targets. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated malnutrition and highlighted the need for food safety. The pandemic has also exposed the deep inequalities in both food systems and societies as a whole. Nonetheless, future food systems can address many of these failings and ensure safe and nutritious food for all. However, structural change is necessary to address the socio-economic drivers behind malnutrition, inequalities and the climate and environmental impacts of food. Adopting a whole-system approach in policy, research and monitoring and evaluation is crucial for managing trade-off and externalities from farm-level to national scales and across multiple sectors and agencies. Supply chain failures will need to be overcome and technology solutions adopted and adapted to specific contexts. A transformation of food systems requires coordinating changes in supply and demand in differentiated ways across world regions: bridging yield gaps and improving livestock feed conversion, largely through agro-ecological practices, deploying soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation at scale, and reducing food loss and waste, as well as addressing over-nourishment and shifting the diets of wealthy populations. The sustainability of global food systems also requires halting the expansion of agriculture into fragile ecosystems, while restoring degraded forests, fisheries, rangelands, peatlands and wetlands. Shifting to more sustainable consumption and production patterns within planetary boundaries will require efforts to influence food demand and diets, diversify food systems, and develop careful land-use planning and management. Integrative policies need to ensure that food prices reflect real costs (including major externalities caused by climate change, land degradation and biodiversity loss, and the public health impacts of malnutrition), reduce food waste and, at the same time, ensure the affordability of safe and healthy food and decent incomes and wages for farmers and food system workers. The harnessing of science and technology solutions and the sharing of actionable knowledge with all players in the food system offer many opportunities. Greater coordination of food system stakeholders is crucial for greater inclusion, greater transparency and more accountability. Sharing lessons and experiences will foster adaptive learning and responsive actions. Careful consideration of the trade-offs, externalities and costs of not acting is needed to ensure that the changes we make benefit all, and especially the most vulnerable in society.</jats:p>

TI  - Unravelling inclusive business models for achieving food and nutrition security in BOP markets
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract There is a growing consensus that one of the key priorities to address food and nutrition security is to aim at the transformation of agriculture and food systems. The private sector can fulfil an important role in this. It is often argued that the success at low income markets (denoted here as Bottom of the Pyramid - BOP) requires innovative and inclusive business models. However, research findings on this have been quite descriptive and generic. The literature on private sector engagement and food and nutrition security has a strong focus on the participation of businesses in the value chain and the food system, but does generally not unravel the specific characteristics of the inclusive business model itself. This article aims to contribute to an improved understanding with regard to inclusive business model characteristics of private sector interventions aiming at food and nutrition security improvements, by scrutinizing 16 cases from Africa, Asia and Latin America. The study focuses on the internal fitness of the strategic business model by analysing the foundation level components of the inclusive business model. Important findings are the relevance of quality of product or service besides its affordability, marketing and distribution strategies to link the different actors in the value chain, and training as well as coalition building to overcome institutional and cultural gaps and increase the success of the inclusive business model for improved nutrition and food security. An important conclusion is that the business model and business ecosystem of BOP markets is crucial. Also, the findings indicate a need for intermediaries to overcome cultural and institutional gaps in implementing inclusive business models.

TI  - Behavior Change, Egg Consumption, and Child Nutrition: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial
PY  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is a significant contributor to child morbidity and mortality globally. Egg consumption has been associated with improved child nutrition yet is rare in rural, resource-poor settings. We test the effects of a culturally tailored behavior change intervention to increase child egg consumption. METHODS: A 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural Burkina Faso with 260 mother-child dyads. Children aged 4 to 17 months from 18 villages were included; those with reported history of malnutrition or egg allergy were excluded. Each child in the full intervention arm received 4 chickens, and mothers received the 10-month behavior change package. Participants in the partial intervention arm received only the behavior change package. RESULTS: In this analysis of 250 children, the full (β = 4.3; P = 6.6 × 10−12) and the partial (β = 1.0; P = .02) interventions significantly increased egg consumption. The full intervention also significantly increased poultry production (β = 11.6; 95% confidence interval 8.3–15; P = 1.1 × 10−5) and women’s decision-making about eggs (β = .66; P = .02), and significantly decreased wasting (β = .58; P = .03) and underweight (β = .47; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The culturally tailored behavior change package significantly increased child egg consumption. When coupled with the gift of chickens, the behavior change intervention yielded a greater increase in egg consumption and significantly reduced wasting and underweight. Behavior change strategies to increase egg consumption should be considered among nutrition and health programs in resource-poor settings where poultry is available.

TI  - Aquaculture for improving productivity, income, nutrition and women's empowerment in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - The review aims to examine and synthesise the state of the evidence around what works to improve productivity, income, nutrition and women's empowerment outcomes of households involved in aquaculture in low‐ and middle‐income countries. We are particularly interested in addressing the following research questions: (1) Do aquaculture interventions increase the productivity, income, nutrition and empowerment of individuals engaged in aquaculture and their households in low‐ and middle‐income countries? (2) Do aquaculture interventions generate income and nutrition spillover effects beyond the farmers' households? (3) To what extent do the effects of aquaculture interventions vary by intervention type, population group, and location? In particular, to what extent do effects vary by gender? (4) What are the potential barriers and facilitating factors that impact the effectiveness of aquaculture interventions? (5) What is the cost‐effectiveness of different aquaculture interventions focused on productivity, income, nutrition and empowerment outcomes?

TI  - Advancing a Multisectoral Platform for Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture in Nigeria: Reflections on Effectiveness and Lessons Learnt.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Inadequate coordination mechanisms and capacity to coordinate are limiting factors for maximizing the ability of agriculture to improve nutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective coordination requires the availability of a platform for stakeholder convening, planning, operationalization of ideas, communication, and accountability. Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development established one such platform to support the institutionalization of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. Platform members include several departments within the Ministry, other ministries, and development partners. While the platform achieved key milestones and fostered collaboration, some gaps remained.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This study reports an assessment to understand the perspectives of members of the coordination platform and identify ways of increasing effectiveness.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Desk reviews of relevant documents and 18 key informant interviews were conducted. Documents and interview notes were coded and analysed to identify recurring themes. Themes were appraised using a nutrition coordination framework.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Sufficiently understanding the nutrition role of representatives' own organization/department and the purpose of the coordination platform and its activities was important for success. The profile and seniority of representing officers also mattered. While the leadership of the Ministry was committed to advancing nutrition through agriculture, the coordination platform could improve its functionality through consistent leadership, increased seniority of member representatives, and appropriate communication.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Multisectoral coordination platforms are necessary but do not alone achieve nutrition coordination. Effective leadership and investments in time, strategic orientation, and training are critical to achieving a shared purpose, individual sector fulfilment of nutrition roles, and additional coordination success factors.</AbstractText>

TI  - Stakeholders, Relationships, and Coordination: 2015 Baseline Study of Needed Enablers for Bridging Agriculture-Nutrition Gaps in Nigeria.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Renewed efforts by the Nigerian government to address malnutrition have led to nutrition actions by several sectors, including the agriculture sector. However, the success of these actions depends on the characteristics of the stakeholders involved, including their relationships and coordination.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This article reports a 2015 study of nutrition-sensitive agricultural stakeholders in Nigeria that assessed what the stakeholders do, where they work and how they are organized to improve nutrition. The study provides a baseline for assessing progress and measuring stakeholder and coordination changes in the Nigerian nutrition-sensitive agriculture landscape.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Semi-structured interviews (n = 17) and focus group discussions (n = 2) were held with federal, state, and local government level stakeholders; reviews of stakeholder program documents were also conducted.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study identified 7 groups of nutrition-sensitive agriculture stakeholders and several coordination challenges. Political leadership, advocacy and provision of material and human resource support by nongovernmental organizations, and donor interest and funding have been vital for mobilizing nutrition-sensitive agriculture. Still, although stakeholders frequently highlighted that nutrition was an important consideration in their interventions, nutrition goals and activities and/or indicators to measure outcomes were not regularly communicated. Also, while coordination mechanisms existed, there appeared to be minimal actual cross-sectoral partnerships because of inadequate trust, competition, and conflicts over institutional turf and mandates.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Needed enablers for improving nutrition-sensitive agriculture in Nigeria included improved stakeholder nutrition literacy, as well as enhanced stakeholder engagement facilitated by role definition, clarification, and consensus. Exploring different approaches to coordination may also be necessary.</AbstractText>

TI  - Effects of agricultural mechanization on economies of scope in crop production in Nigeria
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Agricultural mechanization has often been associated with scale-effects and increased specialization. Such characterizations, however, fail to explain how mechanization may grow in Africa where production environments are heterogeneous even within a farm household, and crop diversification may help in mitigating risks. Using panel data from farm households and crop-specific production costs in Nigeria, we estimate how the adoptions of animal traction or tractors affect the economies of scope (EOS) for rice, non-rice grains, and legumes/seeds, which are the crop groups that are most widely grown with animal traction or tractors in Nigeria, with respect to other non-rice crops. The inverse-probability-weighting method is used to address the potential endogeneity of mechanization adoption and is combined with primal- and dual-models of EOS estimation. The results show that the adoption of these mechanization technologies is associated with greater EOS between rice and non-rice crops but lower EOS among non-rice crops (i.e., between non-rice grains, legumes/seeds, and other non-rice crops). Mechanical technologies may raise EOS between crops that are grown in more heterogeneous environments, even though it may lower EOS between crops that are grown under relatively similar agroecological conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that shows the effects of mechanical technologies on EOS in agriculture in developing countries.

TI  - The Role of Smallholder Farming on Rural Household Dietary Diversity
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The importance of smallholder farming is increasingly recognized in rural areas where increased crop productivity and market participation can effectively improve their dietary diversity and nutrition quality. However, rural households are still faced with severe food insecurity and malnutrition. The study sought to assess the role of smallholder farming in crop productivity and market access on rural household dietary diversity. The secondary data were collected using a quantitative research method, and 1520 participants were selected using a stratified random sampling technique. The descriptive results showed that cereals were the most (98%) consumed food group, while vegetables and fruits were the least consumed food groups, at 37% and 23%, respectively. The results from the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) showed that 57% of smallholder farmers consumed highly diverse diets (more or equal to six food groups), whereas 25% and 18% of smallholder farmers consumed medium dietary diversity (four to five food groups) and low diverse diets (less or equal to three food groups), respectively. The findings from the Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) and Poisson endogenous treatment effect models showed that household size, ownership of livestock, wealth index, and involvement in crop production positively influenced household dietary diversity. On the other hand, output and access to market information showed a negative effect. Social grants had contradicting effects: they had a negative impact on the HDDS received from crop productivity while they had a positive effect on the HDDS from market participation. Providing different ways smallholder farmers can use their funds effectively can help improve household dietary diversity and nutrition quality. The study recommended that more workshops and training be conducted that cover all the sustainable production systems that smallholder farmers can undertake to produce different food groups. These will raise awareness among smallholder farmers about the requirements for balanced diets for food and nutrition security.</jats:p>

TI  - Child-centered food systems: Reorienting food systems towards healthy diets for children
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Current food systems are failing to guide children towards healthy diets. This paper presents a tool to identify the actions needed to reorient food systems to become more child-centred from a nutrition perspective. To connect the dots between children's lives, their food environments and food supply systems, the tool takes a child-centred, food systems approach. Comprising six methodological steps, the tool starts by measuring and understanding children's realities and then working back up into the system to identify how food environments and supply systems could make relevant foods more or less available, affordable, appealing and aspirational in the contexts of children's lives. The paper spells out the mix of methods needed to make this assessment, gives examples of the data and studies already available and type of insights they provide, and discusses the methodological challenges and gaps. It presents a worked example that shows how following these steps in sequence enables the identification of a package of actions that can act coherently to reorient food systems in the way most likely to have impact on child malnutrition.

TI  - Engaging men in maternal, infant and young child nutrition in rural Tanzania: Outcomes from a cluster randomized control trial and qualitative study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is growing recognition that engaging men in maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) interventions can benefit child health and disrupt harmful gender norms. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Tanzania, which engaged men and women in behaviour change via mobile messaging (short message service [SMS]) and traditional interpersonal communication (IPC), separately and in combination. Here, we evaluate intervention effects on individual-level men's MIYCN knowledge and discuss barriers to male engagement. Eligible clusters were dispensary catchment areas with >3000 residents. Forty clusters were stratified by population size and randomly allocated to the four study arms, with 10 clusters per arm. Data on knowledge and intervention exposure were collected from 1394 men through baseline and endline surveys (March-April 2018 and July-September 2019). A process evaluation conducted partway through the 15-18-month intervention period included focus group discussions and interviews. Data were analysed for key trends and themes using Stata and ATLAS.ti software. Male participants in the short message service + interpersonal communication (SMS + IPC) group reported higher exposure to IPC discussions than IPC-only men (43.8% and 21.9%, respectively). Knowledge scores increased significantly across all three intervention groups, with the greatest impact in the SMS + IPC group. Qualitative findings indicated that the main barriers to male participation were a lack of interest in health/nutrition and perceptions that these topics were a woman's responsibility. Other challenges included meeting logistics, prioritizing income-earning activities and insufficient efforts to engage men. The use of a combined approach fusing IPC with SMS is promising, yet countering gender norms and encouraging stronger male engagement may require additional strategies.

TI  - Nutrition sensitive food systems in conflict affected regions: A case study of Afghanistan
PY  - 2021
AB  - The food systems approach can contribute to food security and reduced malnutrition levels by identifying key investments and policies throughout the food system, including production, processing, marketing, and consumption of food. However, in countries facing fragility and conflict, it has proven difficult to implement such an approach and achieve the desired results. This has been the case in Afghanistan, where high levels of malnutrition stem in part from an undersupply of nutritious food. Multi-sectoral approaches to promote nutrition sensitivity and achieve diet-based solutions have also had only limited impact. This paper reports on an analysis of the nutrition sensitivity of food systems in Afghanistan using multi-sector consultations and gap analyses to examine two key food and nutrition policies, the National Comprehensive Agriculture Development Priority Program and the Afghanistan Food Security and Nutrition Agenda. It highlights gaps in the policies and identifies investment priorities to make food systems more nutrition sensitive. The results show that instilling nutrition sensitivity into the operation of Afghanistan’s food systems can only be accomplished if certain key measures are incorporated into the food system. These include addressing the absence of knowledge in the population regarding healthy diets, the lack of sufficient food for vulnerable populations, weak irrigation systems, capacity constraints at individual and institutional levels, data challenges, and weak natural resource management. In addition, the above weaknesses are compounded by the continued violence and conflict-induced insecurity, weak government, and inadequate investments. Given the role of different sectors in contributing to improved nutrition, appropriate and effective multi-stakeholder coordination and collaboration is paramount to such efforts.

TI  - Food security mediates the decrease in women's depressive symptoms in a participatory nutrition-sensitive agroecology intervention in rural Tanzania.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Objective: To investigate if food security mediated the impact of a nutrition-sensitive agroecology intervention on women’s depressive symptoms. Design: We used annual longitudinal data (four time points) from a cluster-randomised effectiveness trial of a participatory nutrition-sensitive agroecology intervention, the Singida Nutrition and Agroecology Project. Structural equation modelling estimation of total, natural direct and natural indirect effects was used to investigate food security’s role in the intervention’s impact on women’s risk of probable depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale > 17) across 3 years. Setting: Rural Singida, Tanzania. Participants: 548 food insecure, married, smallholder women farmers with children < 1 year old at baseline. Results: At baseline, one-third of the women in each group had probable depression (Control: 32·0 %, Intervention: 31·9 %, P difference = 0·97). The intervention lowered the odds of probable depression by 43 % (OR = 0·57, 95 % CI: 0·43, 0·70). Differences in food insecurity explained approximately 10 percentage points of the effects of the intervention on odds of probable depression (OR = 0·90, 95 % CI: 0·83, 0·95). Conclusions: This is the first evidence of the strong, positive effect that lowering food insecurity has on reducing women’s depressive symptoms. Nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions can have broader impacts than previously demonstrated, i.e. improvements in mental health; changes in food security play an important causal role in this pathway. As such, these data suggest participatory nutrition-sensitive agroecology interventions have the potential to be an accessible method of improving women’s well-being in farming communities.

TI  - How Prioritised Policy Commitment Has Improved Food Security and Nutrition in Africa
PY  - 2019
AB  - African governments have prioritised food security and nutrition over the past decade and a half. The benefits of this are starting to emerge. Food availability, access and nutrition have been improving and the proportion of people experiencing food insecurity and malnutrition has been declining. However, progress is not adequate to achieve the targets set by the international development goals or continental aspirations. So too, the gains are eroded by significant population growth that increased the absolute numbers of people still suffering. This chapter reviews the policy context of food security and nutrition in Africa and provides evidence of progress on reducing food insecurity and malnutrition – essential factors in ensuring a quality of life. However, more attention is needed to raise incomes and strengthen purchasing power to improve diets for all people in Africa. Overcoming food insecurity and malnutrition is fundamental to improving the quality of life of the current generation and breaking the inter-generational cycle of deprivation. African governments have shown that change and progress are possible. Scaling up the progress will take continued and sustained commitment and more concerted effort to ensure that economic growth drives positive changes in nutrition.

TI  - Development of the project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI).
PY  - 2019
AB  - With growing commitment to women's empowerment by agricultural development agencies, sound methods and indicators to measure women's empowerment are needed to learn which types of projects or project-implementation strategies do and do not work to empower women. The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which has been widely used, requires adaptation to meet the need for monitoring projects and assessing their impacts. In this paper, the authors describe the adaptation and validation of a project-level WEAI (or pro-WEAI) that agricultural development projects can use to identify key areas of women's (and men's) disempowerment, design appropriate strategies to address identified deficiencies, and monitor project outcomes related to women's empowerment. The 12 pro-WEAI indicators are mapped to three domains: intrinsic agency (power within), instrumental agency (power to), and collective agency (power with). A gender parity index compares the empowerment scores of men and women in the same household. The authors describe the development of pro-WEAI, including: (1) pro-WEAI's distinctiveness from other versions of the WEAI; (2) the process of piloting pro-WEAI in 13 agricultural development projects during the Gender, Agriculture, and Assets Project, phase 2 (GAAP2); (3) analysis of quantitative data from the GAAP2 projects, including intrahousehold patterns of empowerment/disempowerment; and (4) a summary of the findings from the qualitative work exploring concepts of women's empowerment in the project sites. The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned from pro-WEAI and possibilities for further development of empowerment metrics.

TI  - Agriculture–nutrition linkages with heterogeneous, unobserved returns and costs: Insights from Tajikistan
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agriculture–nutrition linkages (ANLs) have been increasingly investigated in the literature. However, nutritional returns and costs of household agricultural production practices (APPs) in semisubsistence settings are poorly understood. We fill these knowledge gaps using pooled cross‐section data sets in Tajikistan, where semisubsistence farming and undernutrition coexist despite relatively good agricultural infrastructure and education systems. Agricultural diversification, yield enhancement, production expansion are positively associated with various nutritional outcomes, particularly in areas with poor food market access. Decomposition exercises suggest that nutritional returns and costs of these APPs vary across households, and the adoption of APPs is driven by the expected nutritional returns. In Tajikistan, improving nutrition through household ANLs requires growing the smallholder agricultural sector in multiple dimensions, including diversification, intensification, and expansion, while also understanding better the pathways of ANLs and addressing bottlenecks at appropriate stages of such pathways.

TI  - Short-Term Implications of Climate Shocks on Wheat-Based Nutrient Flows: A Global "Nutrition at Risk" Analysis through a Stochastic CGE Model.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Food security analyses of international trade largely overlook the importance of substantial heterogeneity and complexity of nutrient content in food products. This paper quantifies the extent to which wheat-based nutrient supplies, including energy, protein, iron, zinc, and magnesium, are exposed to the risks of realistic productivity and trade shocks. By employing a static and stochastic world trade computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we find that productivity shocks may result in losses in households’ nutrient consumption of up to 18% for protein, 33.1% for zinc, and 37.4% for magnesium. Significant losses are observed in countries mostly in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Since the main centers of wheat exports have recently been shifting to former Soviet Union countries, we also simulated the nutritional risks of export restrictions imposed by the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, which have resorted to this policy instrument in recent years. We find that partial export restrictions increase the probability of nutrient shocks by five times or more in most countries that we studied. Increased nutrient deficiencies have a range of public health implications in the affected countries, which could be mitigated and/or avoided by adjusting production and trade policies and by targeting high nutritional risk groups, such as women and children. Since the potential implications of supply shocks are diffused across countries through international trade, the stricter regulation of export restrictions to enhance the predictably and reliability of global food supplies is also needed.

TI  - The role of drinking water source, sanitation, and solid waste management in reducing childhood stunting in Indonesia
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Indonesia still bears a significant public health problem of stunting among under-5 (U-5) children. Environmental factors have been demonstrated to be associated with stunting as indirect causes. However, the extent to which the environmental factors determine the stunting burden in rural Indonesia is stil underexplored. Hence, this study investigates environmental factors that determine stunting among U-5 children in the rural areas of Indonesia. We employed data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey 2014/2015 (IFLS5) and selected a sample size of 2,571 children under five years of age residing in rural areas. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis and estimated the “population attributable fraction” (PAF) of drinking water, sanitation, and garbage collection on stunting. The results suggest that unimproved drinking water source and improper garbage collection correspond with higher odds of child stunting. Inadequate sanitation facility, however, was not found to be significantly influencing the odds of stunting. Moreover, household wealth is protective of risk of stunting. Furthermore, the PAF analysis demonstrated that 21.58% of the stunting burden among U-5 children residing in rural areas are preventable by providing access to an improved drinking water source and better household solid waste management to prevent repeated infections.</jats:p>

PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>This study analyzed the role of women’s empowerment in diversifying the diet of households through their own production. Developed from empowerment and food security theories, this study constructed measures from the household dietary diversity score (HDDS) and Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI). The study focused on poverty-stricken regions in China and conducted a thematic questionnaire-based household survey on gender and food consumption in 2021. Based on micro-level evidence from 1199 rural households, this research found a low score of women’s empowerment and an average WEI of 0.689; the status of diet diversity, measured by the HDDS, varied by income and social class; and the average rate was low. Agricultural production diversity and women’s empowerment are positively associated with diet diversity. There is strong evidence that women’s employment mitigates the side effects of decreasing production diversity on households’ diet security. As a result, women’s empowerment can potentially mitigate the adverse consequences of low agricultural diversification in household diet quality in less developed areas. This study provides evidence for repurposing food and agricultural policies toward healthy diets and gender-responsive agrifood systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Nationally representative estimates of the cost of adequate diets, nutrient level drivers, and policy options for households in rural Malawi.
PY  - 2022
AB  - A growing literature uses least-cost diets to evaluate how effectively a food system supports access to nutritious foods. We identify the cost of meeting nutrient requirements for whole households in rural Malawi from and the nutrient-level drivers thereof. From 2013 to 2017, we can identify a household least-cost diet only 60% of the time with an average cost of $2.32/person/day (2011 US$ PPP). We illustrate that larger households have more diverse nutrient needs and face a higher cost for 1000 calories of a sufficiently nutrient dense diet. Shadow price analysis shows riboflavin to be the costliest nutrient in the market. We use policy scenarios to understand what drives the infeasibility and high cost. Simulating the impact of selenium soil biofortification of maize results in a feasible diet 94% of the time at half the cost ($1.22/person/day on average) and eliminates the shadow price of copper. This is explained by insufficient selenium from sources low in copper such that under baseline conditions it is impossible to get enough selenium without too much copper. Even when feasible, to avoid copper, more higher cost foods enter the diet than would be otherwise needed to meet remaining nutrient requirements. Other value chain scenarios to increase the availability and lower the cost of nutrient-dense foods did not meaningfully change the diet cost results. Of direct relevance to Malawi, this study demonstrates more broadly how least-cost diet methods can be used to assess barriers to accessing an adequate diet and the potential impacts of policy options.

TI  - Market access and dietary diversity: A spatially explicit multi-level analysis in Southern and Western Kenya
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The risk of malnutrition, particularly micronutrient deficiency, is high in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa for smallholder farmers. Access to diverse and nutritious food is a key component of food security, and a major development objective. It is widely accepted that good access to markets can play a key role in improving nutrition at the foodshed level. However, the magnitude and even the direction of the effect of increased market access on household dietary diversity (and thus food security) is not universal, with studies showing divergent results. One reason for these divergences may be that models do not account for place-based mediation effects, that is, farmers' local context can affect whether (and the extent to which) access to market is important to their nutrition. Drawing on household survey data from 914 Kenyan smallholder farmers from ten counties in South and West Kenya, we used a novel methodology to evaluate the role of market access in determining household dietary diversity. This methodology combines the clustering of households along places with similar characteristics and multi-level regression analysis to understand the place based variation in effects of different factors on dietary diversity. We found that, depending on how “access to market” is measured, there can be significant impacts on dietary diversity, and this is mediated by farm characteristics. For small farms with already good market access, higher diet diversity is associated with cultivating larger areas and owning larger livestock holdings, but not with easier market access. For isolated larger farms with a focus on livestock production, higher diet diversity is associated with easier market access (i.e., proximity to road), as well as greater livestock diversity. For medium-sized farms with good market access, diet diversity is mildly correlated with easier market access (i.e., proximity to road) but significantly associated with greater crop diversity. The need to account for place-based mediating effects is clearly important and highlights an exigency for greater use and development of localized models that can capture the extent to which effects might change when contexts change.</jats:p>

TI  - Changing food systems and infectious disease risks in low-income and middle-income countries.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 has drawn the attention of health researchers sharply back to the role that food systems can play in generating human disease burden. But emerging pandemic threats are just one dimension of the complex relationship between agriculture and infectious disease, which is evolving rapidly, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that are undergoing rapid food system transformation. We examine this changing relationship through four current disease issues. The first is that greater investment in irrigation to improve national food security raises risks of vector-borne disease, which we illustrate with the case of malaria and rice in Africa. The second is that the intensification of livestock production in LMICs brings risks of zoonotic diseases like cysticercosis, which need to be managed as consumer demand grows. The third is that the nutritional benefits of increasing supply of fresh vegetables, fruit, and animal-sourced foods in markets in LMICs pose new food-borne disease risks, which might undermine supply. The fourth issue is that the potential human health risks of antimicrobial resistance from agriculture are intensified by changing livestock production. For each disease issue, we explore how food system transition is creating unintentional infectious disease risks, and what solutions might exist for these problems. We show that successfully addressing all of these challenges requires a coordinated approach between public health and agricultural sectors, recognising the costs and benefits of disease-reducing interventions to both, and seeking win-win solutions that are most likely to attract broad policy support and uptake by food systems.

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive chicken production in Ethiopia: a qualitative evaluation
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Small-scale chicken production holds great potential as a nutrition-sensitive strategy in low-income settings, due to its potential for improving income, increasing the consumption of nutritious foods (including eggs and meat), and empowering women. This study sought to evaluate the impacts of and to identify challenges and solutions for a nutrition-sensitive chicken production intervention in rural Ethiopia. We conducted a qualitative study following the endline evaluation of the African Chicken Genetic Gains and Agriculture to Nutrition project in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia. Using semi-structured interviews, we held twelve Focus Group Discussions with woman project participants and six Key Informant Interviews with project staff. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Six Focus Group Discussions were with participants in the African Chicken Genetic Gains intervention, through which women received 25 high-yielding chickens. The other six Focus Group Discussions were held with participants who (in addition to the African Chicken Genetic Gains intervention) also received the Agriculture to Nutrition intervention, which focused on nutrition-sensitive behavior change communication related to child feeding, water, sanitation and hygiene, and home gardening. The African Chicken Genetic Gains and the Agriculture to Nutrition interventions benefited participants through improved income, nutrition, and child caregiving knowledge. Nutrition and child feeding benefits were emphasized more in the nutrition-sensitive behavior change arm, while income benefits were emphasized more in the arm that did not receive behavior change. The primary challenges of the project included death and disease of chickens and implementation issues at both the project and household levels. Recommendations to address these challenges included improved chicken housing designs, access to inputs, access to veterinary care (including vaccines and medication), and project logistics. The nutrition-sensitive and chicken production interventions were largely well-received by participants. Most participants agreed that the benefits of the project outweighed the challenges. Future projects would benefit from logistical and infrastructural improvements to improve implementation and impacts on nutrition, health, and livelihoods.</jats:p>

TI  - Implementation and scale-up of nutrition-sensitive agriculture in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review of what works, what doesn't work and why
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evidence is rapidly growing on the impact pathways through which nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) contributes to improving nutritional outcomes. However, to harness NSA's full potential, it is equally important to understand why impacts are achieved (or not) and which factors play a role. Evidence on success and failure factors as well as external barriers and facilitators that influence the implementation and scale-up of NSA in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is still limited. To address this gap, we reviewed empirical evidence (since 2000) on factors influencing NSA implementation and scale-up. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the analysis and synthesis of this systematic review. Eighty-five studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and synthesized across the five domains of the CFIR; here we report findings from three of the domains: NSA interventions, inner setting and outer setting. Many factors related to each of the domains were identified: intervention-specific factors (clustered in seven sub-domains and 23 themes), local contextual factors (in six sub-domains and 23 themes), and factors related to the broader enabling environment (in five sub-domains and 12 themes). A strong interplay among factors across the three domains was observed. This review highlights key areas for attention to enhance the success of NSA programs: learning from past successes and failures; appropriateness and acceptability based on context knowledge; project flexibility in addressing design limitations and coping with unforeseen hindrances; strengthening local structures, community empowerment and increasing resilience; supportive policy and governance. Our findings can help decision-makers at multiple levels to strengthen on-going/future NSA programs and anticipate possible pitfalls to maximise NSA's potential to reduce undernutrition in LMICs.

TI  - Fish Nutritional Value as an Approach to Children's Nutrition.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Fish is a relatively cheap and accessible source of animal protein for human consumption even in rural communities. It is critical for global food and nutrition security, and its consumption continues to increase. As a highly nutritious food, fish consumption is highly recommended for children and expectant mothers for normal growth and development. The present paper explores the nutritional value of fish as approach to nutrition in children and its benefits. The findings reveal that fish is a valuable source of essential amino acids (EAA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that play important physiological functions for maintenance and development of fetuses, neonates, and infant brains. Therefore, it could be a valuable tool in the fight against food insecurity and malnutrition. However, fish and fish products are also highly susceptible to contamination by various organic and inorganic compounds that threaten public health. Particularly, heavy metals and biogenic amines (BAs) have shown adverse effects when contaminated fish is consumed, and the effects in children have been worse. Hence, while fish consumption is highly recommended for children's nutrition, the safety and quality of the product should always be checked to safeguard public health.

TI  - Food consumption patterns, nutrient adequacy, and the food systems in Nigeria
PY  - 2021
AB  - Previous studies in Nigeria examined food and nutrition security mainly using anthropometric indicators, total calorie intake, or the household dietary diversity score (HDDS). However, recent evidence on nutrient and dietary gaps, especially from nationally representative surveys, is weak. This study contributes by examining factors influencing household mean nutrient adequacy and HDDS with focus on components of food systems in Nigeria. Based on the 2015/16 Nigeria General Household Survey, we found that fruits and animal source foods were the least consumed food groups. Yet, these food groups seem to be the main sources of difference in HDDS and were strongly associated with the mean probability of nutrient adequacy, given covariates. Among 11 nutrients under study, large shortfalls were observed in consumption of iron, vitamin B12, and riboflavin with probability of adequacy being 0.2 or below, followed by niacin, vitamin C, and zinc with corresponding probability of adequacy ranged between 0.48 and 0.58. Further, results suggested that mobile phone ownership by the household head, household’s access to electricity, improved sources of water for household consumption, and percent of the community with improved sanitation were strongly associated with HDDS. Heterogeneities in food groups and nutrient consumption and food system drivers are discussed.

TI  - Are home gardening programs a sustainable way to improve nutrition? Lessons from a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Rufiji, Tanzania.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Homestead food production (HFP) programs may improve diet and nutrition outcomes by increasing availability of nutrient dense foods such as vegetables and supporting livelihoods. We conducted a pair-matched cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vegetable home gardens could improve women's dietary diversity, household food security, maternal and child iron status, and the probability of women consuming nutrient-rich food groups. We enrolled 1,006 women of reproductive age (18-49 years) in ten villages in Pwani Region, Eastern Tanzania, matched the villages into pairs according to village characteristics, and randomly allocated villages to intervention or control. Households in the intervention villages received agricultural training, inputs to promote home production of nutritious crops, and nutrition and health education. Data were collected in 2016, 2017, and 2019 and analyzed using linear regression models with propensity score weighting adjusting for individual-level confounders, differential loss to follow-up, and fixed effects for village pairs to accommodate the pair-matched design. Results after one year of the intervention (previously published) found significant improvements in dietary diversity. However, three years after the start of the intervention the difference in dietary diversity disappeared, even though the number of women who grew at least one crop was significantly higher (75 percentage points, 95% CI: 72, 81) in treatment households compared to controls. Barriers to maintaining a home garden, including lack of irrigation opportunities and fencing materials, and social disruption may have precluded sustained impacts from home gardening in this context. Future home garden programs should carefully consider mechanisms and investments needed for sustained impact over time.

TI  - Seasonality and Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture in Kenya: Evidence from Mixed-Methods Research in Rural Lake Naivasha Basin
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study investigates the impact of seasonality within the debate on nutrition-sensitive agriculture focusing on rural Lake Naivasha Basin in Kenya, which presents an interesting case study of the food system in East Africa. Seasonality shapes food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa, dominated by a rain-fed system; however, lack of monthly data hampers understanding. Using mixed methods, this study constructs a monthly dataset of a representative sample of households from February 2018 to January 2019. A fixed-effects analysis highlights the association between three pathways from agriculture to nutrition while controlling for the hunger and harvesting seasons by crop. Supported by qualitative information from focus groups, the results suggest that seasonality is an important dimension of the agriculture–nutrition link and promote understanding of the complexity of the pathways suggested by the literature, including the association between crops and dietary diversity, with relevant policy implications.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Le Mali a quadruple sa population entre 1960 et 2020. Cette croissance demographique implique des besoins d’acces a la securite alimentaire et nutritionnelle, a la sante, a l’education et a l’emploi pour les primo arrivants. C’est le secteur agricole qui est sollicite par les politiques publiques pour repondre a cette demande. Quelle est la tendance demographique dans la zone cotonniere du Mali ? Quelles ont ete les reponses locales face aux implications de cette croissance demographique en termes d’acces a la sante et a l’education ? Le present article repond a ces questions a travers la mobilisation et l’analyse statistique et spatiale des donnees sur la production agricole et l’acces a la sante et a l’education a plusieurs echelles. Les resultats revelent : (1) une croissance demographique superieure a la moyenne du pays mais inegalement repartie, (2) une augmentation progressive de la quantite de cereales (mais, mil et sorgho) par habitant liee a un accroissement de la production agricole plus rapide que celui de la population et (3) des progres importants en matiere d’acces physique aux infrastructures de sante et d’education. Cependant, la croissance demographique et les nouveaux defis lies a la securite alimentaire et a la nutrition soulevent de nouvelles interrogations sur la capacite de l’agriculture a repondre a une demande de produits agricoles plus soutenue et diversifiee.

TI  - Global Burden of Nutritional Deficiencies among Children under 5 Years of Age from 2010 to 2019.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Under-five years of age is a critical period for children's growth and development. Nutritional deficiency during this period is associated with wasting, underweight and stunting. We aimed to conduct an epidemiological study using data derived from the GBD2019 to found the global distribution and changing trends of nutritional deficiencies among children under 5 years old, as well as the correlation between social development status and nutritional deficiencies. Nutritional deficiencies in children under 5 years has been substantially improved in the past decade; however, the progress has been unevenly distributed globally. The incidence and DALY rate decreased with the increase of socio-demographic index. In 2019, the incidence (51,872.0 per 100,000) was highest in Central Sub-Saharan Africa and the DALY rate (5597.1 per 100,000) was the highest in Western Sub-Saharan Africa. Among five subcategories of nutritional deficiencies in children under 5 years, vitamin A deficiency accounted for the largest proportion of incident cases (100,511,850, 62.1% in 2019), while the proportion of DALYs caused by protein-energy malnutrition was the highest (9,925,276, 62.0%). Nutritional deficiency in some countries remains worrisome, for whom policies guarantees and sustained efforts to control nutritional deficiencies are urgently needed.

TI  - Reverse thinking: taking a healthy diet perspective towards food systems transformations
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Food systems that deliver healthy diets without exceeding the planet’s resources are essential to achieve the worlds’ ambitious development goals. Healthy diets need to be safe, accessible, and affordable for all, including for disadvantaged and nutritionally vulnerable groups such as of smallholder producers, traders, and consumers in low- and middle-income countries. Globally, food systems are experiencing rapid and drastic changes and are failing to fulfil these multiple duties simultaneously. The international community therefore calls for rigorous food systems transformations and policy solutions to support the achievement of healthy diets for all. Most strategies, however, are essentially supply- and market-oriented. Incorporation of a healthy diet perspective in food system transformation is essential to enable food systems to deliver not only on supplying nutritious foods but also on ensuring that consumers have access can afford and desire healthy, sustainable, and culturally acceptable diets. This paper argues that this should be guided by information on diets, dietary trends, consumer motives, and food environment characteristics. Transformational approaches and policies should also take into account the stage of food system development requiring different strategies to ensure healthier diets for consumers. We review current knowledge on drivers of consumer choices at the individual and food environment level with special emphasis on low- and middle income countries, discuss the converging and conflicting objectives that exist among multiple food-system actors, and argue that failure to strengthen synergies and resolve trade-offs may lead to missed opportunities and benefits, or negative unintended consequences in food system outcomes. The paper proposes a menu of promising consumer- and food-environment- oriented policy options to include in the food systems transformation agenda in order to shift LMIC consumer demand towards healthier diets in low- and middle income countries.</jats:p>

TI  - Water strategies and water-food Nexus: challenges and opportunities towards sustainable development in various regions of the World.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The twenty-first century is witnessing an explosion in global population, environmental changes, agricultural land disintegration, hunger, and geopolitical instabilities. It is difficult to manage these conditions or standardize improvement systems without thinking of the three main elements or subsystems that are necessary for any meaningful development-namely water (W), energy (E), and food (F). These key elements form what is globally agreed upon as the "WEF Nexus." While considering them, one should think about the other key factors that influence WEF Nexus, including population's growth, impacts of environmental changes (including climate change), moderation and adaptation regimes to climate change and climate resilience, loss of biodiversity, and sustainable nature. Together, the WEF Nexus subsystems represent a framework to ensure environmental protection that should be seen as an ethical and socioeconomic obligation. Issues, such as protection of water resources, and strategies and management tools or mechanisms for the use of water assets and agricultural innovations under the obligations of sustainable use, are investigated in this paper. Attention is paid to the relationship between water and food (WF Nexus) or water for food security in various world regions, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Central Asia countries and the Caucasus, China, Africa, and Canada. This paper also presents analyses of a great number of up-to-date publications regarding the "Nexus" perspective and its applications and limitations. This paper suggests that the Nexus' approach, in its different concepts (WEF, WE, WF and EF), can promote sustainable development and improve the quality of life of communities, while preserving natural, human, and social capital, addressing sustainability challenges, and protecting natural resources and the environment for long-term use.

TI  - Sustaining Livestock Production Under the Changing Climate: Africa Scenario for Nigeria Resilience and Adaptation Actions
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate change is a global millennial challenge affecting humans in all facets of life. In AfricaAfrica, livestockLivestock production is one of the sectors most affected by climate change because livestockLivestock production is extensive, smallholders operated, and low external input operation. The paper gives an insight for sustaining Africa’sAfrica livestockLivestock production in resilienceResilience to climate change. The study obtained secondary meteorological and livestock production data for the continent over forty years, and the data were analysed for the understanding of changes over the years and prediction of future scenario. The result revealed that by the year 2050, the average surface temperature in Africa will rise by 2.2 °C, while the livestockLivestock population will continue to grow. The result also indicated that the scenario revealed in the study is an AfricaAfrica-wide condition, but the West Africa subregion of Africa could be the most vulnerable to the climate change impactClimate change impact of temperature rise. The study also indicated that small ruminant animals including sheep and goats could be more tolerant to the future changing climate scenarios in AfricaAfrica compared with other livestock because their population keeps increasing over the years despite the climate change threats. Finally, future projections of climate conditions indicated that AfricaAfrica could be a hub of future livestock production, but climate conditions would affect optimal animal performances and production. Therefore, several strategies to sustain livestockLivestock production were suggested as resilient means for adapting to the changing climate conditions.

TI  - Impact of home garden interventions in East Africa: Results of three randomized controlled trials
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest per capita consumption of vegetables of all regions in the world. As low vegetable consumption is associated with poor human health, there is need for effective policies and interventions to increase it. Home garden interventions have proven effective in several countries in Asia, but evidence from large trials is scant in Africa. Using data from a home garden promotion project in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, this study tests the hypothesis that home garden interventions, offered to rural households with women 14–35 years of age and/or with children under five years of age, increase household production and consumption of vegetables. Three randomized controlled trials collected pre- and post-intervention data (2 years apart) for 1,255 intervention and control households. We report intent-to-treat effects and the treatment effect on the treated and analyze distributional effects using quantile regression. For Tanzania, the results show a 20% increase in households producing vegetables and an additional two months of vegetable harvesting, but no such significant effects were found for Kenya and Uganda. We find no significant effects on diets. Lack of impact may be explained from the fact that many participating households were already producing vegetables (reducing the scope for impact) and a low participation rate of selected households in training events. These results stand in contrast to the positive impacts of home garden interventions in Asia. The results suggest a need to better understand barriers to home garden interventions in the three countries and a need for more careful design, local adaptation and targeting.

TI  - Factors associated with nutrition intervention adherence: Evidence from a cluster-randomised controlled trial in Kenya.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Nutrition experts point to the importance of a multipronged approach to address high stunting rates in rural areas. This can include nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions, such as the provision of micronutrient powder, eggs, and chlorine, and nutrition training to improve feeding practices. In 2018, an agricultural nongovernmental organisation initiated a multipronged approach as part of a randomised trial. However, adherence to a programme with so many components can be challenging for participants. The aim of this study is to understand which factors are associated with high adherence in complex multifaceted nutrition-sensitive agricultural programmes. We used a mixed method approach in which we used bivariate and multivariable analyses to estimate the relationship between child and caregiver demographic factors with product adherence. We analyzed data from six focus groups and 120 feedback sessions on barriers to product adherence. We found that the age and sex of the child did not influence product adherence, but caregivers were more likely to adhere to all products if they were not the child's biological mother (most often grandmothers) (0.28 higher adherence score; p < 0.001) and if caregivers were older (0.34 higher adherence score, p < 0.001). A higher monthly training attendance, combining product distribution and interactive training, predicted stronger product adherence. Participants noted that adherence was supported by the early demonstration of positive results, regular reminders, interactive trainings, and the encouragement of family members. These findings underscore the importance of combining product distribution with training and include potentially targeting grandmothers and other caregivers who may demonstrate higher product adherence.

TI  - Reflections of Food Policy Evolution over the Last Three Decades
PY  - 2020
AB  - For the last three decades, food policy in developing countries has evolved rapidly from a singular focus on producing more food to broader focus on protecting natural resources, reducing poverty and malnutrition, and promoting climate adaptation and mitigation. Since receiving my PhD in the late 1980s, I have dedicated most of my research and research management to these policy issues. After 35 years aboard, I returned to my home country in 2020, where I work with my colleagues at China Agricultural University and continue to conduct policy research on transforming food systems for human and planetary health. This paper is my reflection of policy evolution over the last three decades.

TI  - Behaviour change interventions improve maternal and child nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Evidence that nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions can improve maternal and child nutrition status in sub-Saharan Africa is inconclusive. Using behaviour change theory and techniques in intervention design may increase effectiveness and make outcomes more predictable. This systematic review aimed to determine whether interventions that included behaviour change functions were effective. Six databases were searched systematically, using MeSH and free-text terms, for articles describing nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive behaviour change interventions published in English until January 2022. Titles, abstracts and full-text papers were double-screened. Data extraction and quality assessments followed Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Behaviour change functions of interventions were mapped onto the COM-B model and Behaviour Change Wheel. PROSPERO registered (135054). The search yielded 1193 articles: 79 articles met inclusion criteria, ranging from low (n = 30) to high (n = 11) risk of bias. Many that applied behaviour change theory, communication or counselling resulted in significant improvements in infant stunting and wasting, household dietary intake and maternal psychosocial measures. Interventions with >2 behaviour change functions (including persuasion, incentivisation, environmental restructuring) were the most effective. We recommend incorporating behaviour change functions in nutrition interventions to improve maternal and child outcomes, specifically drawing on the Behaviour Change Wheel, COM-B model (SORT B recommendation). To enhance the designs of these interventions, and ultimately improve the nutritional and psychosocial outcomes for mothers and infants in sub-Saharan Africa, collaborations are recommended between behaviour change and nutrition experts, intervention designers, policy makers and commissioners to fund and roll-out multicomponent behaviour change interventions.

TI  - Women’s Empowerment and Crop Diversification in Bangladesh: A Possible Pathway to Climate Change Adaptation and Better Nutrition
PY  - 2019
AB  - The existing literature shows that climate change will likely affect several of the dimensions that determine people’s food security status in Bangladesh, from crop production to the availability of food products and their accessibility. Crop diversification represents a farm-level response that reduces exposure to climate-related risks and it has also been shown to increase diet diversity and contribute to the reduction in micronutrient deficiencies. In fact, the Government of Bangladesh has several policies in place that encourage and support agricultural diversification. However, despite this support the level of crop diversification in the country remains low. Women empowerment has been linked to diversified diets and positively associated with better child nutrition outcomes. Furthermore, although traditionally their role in agriculture tends to be undervalued, women involvement has already been shown to affect agricultural production choices and enhance technical efficiency. This paper connects three different areas of inquiry - climate change, gender and nutrition – by exploring whether women’s empowerment in agricultural production leads to increased diversification in the use of farmland. Specifically, we use a series of econometric techniques to evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence to claim that a higher levels of empowerment lead to greater diversity in the allocation of farmland to agricultural crops. Our results reveal that indeed some aspects of women empowerment, but not all, lead to a more diversified use of farmland and to a transition for cereal production to other uses like vegetables and fruits. These findings provide some possible pathways for gender-sensitive interventions that promote crop diversity as a risk management tool and as a way to improve the availability of nutritious crops.

TI  - When food systems meet sustainability – Current narratives and implications for actions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The concept of food system has gained prominence in recent years amongst both scholars and policy-makers. Experts from diverse disciplines and backgrounds have in particular discussed the nature and origin of the “unsustainability” of our modern food systems. These efforts tend, however, to be framed within distinctive disciplinary narratives. In this paper we propose to explore these narratives and to shed light on the explicit -or implicit- epistemological assumptions, mental models, and disciplinary paradigms that underpin those. The analysis indicates that different views and interpretations prevail amongst experts about the nature of the “crisis”, and consequently about the research and priorities needed to “fix” the problem. We then explore how sustainability is included in these different narratives and the link to the question of healthy diets. The analysis reveals that the concept of sustainability, although widely used by all the different communities of practice, remains poorly defined, and applied in different ways and usually based on a relatively narrow interpretation. In so doing we argue that current attempts to equate or subsume healthy diets within sustainability in the context of food system may be misleading and need to be challenged. We stress that trade-offs between different dimensions of food system sustainability are unavoidable and need to be navigated in an explicit manner when developing or implementing sustainable food system initiatives. Building on this overall analysis, a framework structured around several entry points including outcomes, core activities, trade-offs and feedbacks is then proposed, which allows to identify key elements necessary to support the transition toward sustainable food systems.

TI  - Policies Affecting Food Supply Chains
PY  - 2021
AB  - Food and agricultural policies shape what types of food are produced and their movement through the food supply chain at the global, regional, and local levels. Well-functioning, ideal food supply chains provide sufficient safe, nutritious food for everyone around the world. This chapter discusses the many different types of food supply policies relevant to diets and nutrition, as well as the role that different actors play in shaping these policies. Policies that affect food production and trade; processing and packaging; and markets, distribution, and public procurement represent opportunities to improve supply chains and leverage them for nutrition and health goals.

TI  - Food access deficiencies in sub-Saharan Africa: prevalence and implications for agricultural interventions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Our understanding of food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been hampered by limitations in the temporal and spatial representativeness of data. Food balance sheets provide scalable estimates of per capita food availability, but fail to represent food access, stability and their causal linkages. In contrast, rural household surveys represent detailed conditions for one or multiple points in time, but are influenced by survey timing and are often limited in geographical coverage. This study draws on a large sample of rural land-holding households in SSA (n = 6,353) to identify household level food access deficiencies and to understand the associations with rural livelihoods and food sourcing behavior throughout the year. Food access deficiencies were identified using food security of access and diet diversity indicators. Dietary diversity and channel of access (farm or purchased) were enumerated for the “flush” and “lean” periods and food security of access was enumerated for the lean period only - making the results of this study independent of survey timing. As many as 39% of households were classified as severely food insecure (in terms of food access) and as many as 49% of households were likely to be deficient in micronutrients in the lean period. Vulnerability to food insecurity and micronutrient deficiencies differed by household composition, agricultural livelihood characteristics and agro-ecological zone. Dairy, fruit and vitamin A-rich produce were predominantly accessed through the farm channel. Households with a livestock component to their farm had a lower prevalence of severe food insecurity and higher diet diversity scores. These findings have implications for the development of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions. Interventions need to be tailored to agro-ecological zone, household composition, scale of operation and production mix. Increasing income will not necessarily result in improved diet diversity or healthy dietary choices. Interventions focused on income generation should monitor and promote crop and livestock production diversity and provide nutrition education.

TI  - Organized Homegardens Contribute to Micronutrient Intakes and Dietary Diversity of Rural Households in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2019
AB  - A greater diversity of crops grown in homegardens in Sri Lanka is thought to be positively associated with increased nutritional diversity of the diet of members of households and their improved nutritional status and health. However, no studies have been made to evaluate the quantitative contribution of homegardens to people’s food and nutrient intake and security. Here we report three studies to test an improved homegarden production system, with agricultural and extension interventions, designed for the mid-country wet zone in Sri Lanka. The study assessed the impact of the improved system on crop type diversity, on dietary intake and diversity and food and nutritional security of the households. In Study 1, 100 households with homegardens were evaluated for their household characteristics and homegarden practices. Study 2 was on a sub sample of 20 households each with organized homegardens (OHG); households were provided with planting material, agricultural inputs and advice, and were regularly monitored by a field officer for methodical farming. These improved home gardens were contrasted with non-organized homegardens (NOHG; without intervention) to measure crop diversity through a simple species count. Study 3 assessed 25 sample households with OHG and 20 households with NOHG: dietary nutrient intake and diversity and household food security were quantified. Family food consumption was assessed using a 5-day diet diary. Perceived household food security status was determined using United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Nutrient intakes, dietary adequacy and contribution to dietary diversity from produce derived from homegarden were calculated. A total of 149 crop species were recorded in the homegardens with a 14% greater diversity in OHG than NOHG. Household food security was not significantly associated with organized or non-organized homegardens. The improved, organized home gardens provided diets with a greater contribution of energy, carbohydrates, fat, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, thiamin, niacin, vitamin C and vitamin A compared with NOHG. The study demonstrates that households with OHG had greater dietary diversity from homegarden produce compared with that of households with NOHG leading to better food and micronutrient intake and nutritional security.

TI  - Intensified rice production negatively impacts plant biodiversity, diet, lifestyle and quality of life: transdisciplinary and gendered research in the Middle Senegal River Valley
PY  - 2022
AB  - A major programme of irrigated rice extension in the Middle Senegal River Valley has further limited the river’s natural flooding in the floodplain (Waalo), initially reduced by drought. We conducted a transdisciplinary (TD) and gendered study in the region to explore links between agricultural biodiversity and family diets using a social analysis of women’s practices. The results showed how rice expansion impacts local agrobiodiversity, diet quality and the cultural way of life. Disappearance of the singular agropastoral and fishing system of the Senegal River Valley is profoundly modifying the landscape, limiting wooded riverine settings, and is undermining the traditional diversified flood-recession cropping system in the Waalo. This is causing an overconsumption of rice by reducing alternative food sources, such as sorghum, vegetables and animal products (fish, milk and meat). In particular, flood-recession sorghums are in danger of disappearing, yet they are more nutritious than rice and now sell for twice as much, or more. The way of life is being disrupted, notably sociabilities previously based on territorial complementarities, and women are disadvantaged in terms of recognition and added workload. Women’s groups have launched collective irrigated gardens, organic or not, only supported by the local NGO, but any surplus is hardly ever sold on the weekly markets in the neighbourhood. Moreover, this diet imbalance increases nutritional risk factors for health, such as vitamin and iron deficiencies, especially for women, hypertension and diabetes. We argue that, firstly, gendered TD experiences are relevant for documenting women’s activities in order for them to gain political support and, secondly, that targeting women’s care tasks gives more value and impact to TD research results.

TI  - Agricultural production diversity and child nutrition in Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study investigates how two aspects of agricultural production diversity – farm production diversity and composition of production – relate to child height-for-age and weight-for-height in Ethiopia. We use longitudinal data on child anthropometric measurements, household farm production diversity and farm production composition from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey for 2011, 2013, and 2015 available through the World Bank. Using longitudinal fixed effects models, we show that an increase in farm production diversity reduces the risk of chronic food insecurity (child height-for-age) but has no impact on acute measures of food insecurity (child weight-for-height). Results also suggest that, in a context of poor rainfall, more diversity in farm production can adversely impact child height-for-age, although livestock sales might mitigate that detrimental effect. These findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between farm-level food production and child nutrition in a context of climate change.</jats:p>

TI  - Women's role of caregiving for under-five children: Implications for dietary diversity and food security in Ghana
PY  - 2022
AB  - This study examines the implications of women’s role of caregiving under-five children on household food security. Using two-stage least square instrumental variable estimation, we analyzed cross-sectional data from 305 smallholder farmers from rural areas in Ghana. The results indicate that household characteristics such as size, gender, and marital status also influence household dietary diversity. A government agricultural program that seeks to improve farmers’ income has the potential to improve household dietary diversity. The most important finding is that the women’s role of taking care of under-five children has negative effect on food household dietary diversity and therefore has negative implications for security of the household in rural settings. However, improved income and education mitigate the negative effects of caregiving to children under five on the household food security. A policy implication of the results is that providing nutrition knowledge to women through food security programming is vital to improving household food security and such programmes must also target family planning.

TI  - A chicken production intervention and additional nutrition behavior change component increased child growth in Ethiopia: A cluster-randomized trial
PY  - 2020
AB  - ABSTRACT Background Chicken production in the context of nutrition-sensitive agriculture may benefit child nutrition in low-income settings. Objectives This study evaluated effects of 1) a chicken production intervention [African Chicken Genetic Gains (ACGG)], and 2) the ACGG intervention with nutrition-sensitive behavior change communication (BCC) [ACGG + Agriculture to Nutrition (ATONU)], on child nutrition and health outcomes and hypothesized intermediaries. Methods Forty ACGG villages received 25 genetically improved chickens and basic husbandry guidance; of these, 20 ACGG + ATONU villages in addition received a nutrition-sensitive behavior change and homegardening intervention; 20 control clusters received no intervention. We assessed effects of the interventions on height-for-age z scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z scores (WAZ), and weight-for-height z scores (WHZ) at 9 (midline) and 18 mo (endline) through unadjusted and adjusted ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. We examined the interventions’ effects on hypothesized intermediaries including egg production and consumption, dietary diversity, women's empowerment, income, child morbidities, anemia, and chicken management practices through OLS and log binomial models. Results Data included 829 children aged 0–36 mo at baseline. ACGG + ATONU children had higher midline HAZ [mean difference (MD): 0.28; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.54] than controls. The ACGG group had higher HAZ (MD: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.50) and higher WAZ (MD: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.36) at endline than controls; after adjusting for potential baseline imbalance, effects were similar but not statistically significant. At endline, differences in ACGG + ATONU children's HAZ and WAZ compared with controls were similar in magnitude to those of ACGG, but not statistically significant. There were no differences in anthropometry between the intervention groups. ACGG + ATONU children had higher dietary diversity and egg consumption than ACGG children at endline. Both interventions showed improvements in chicken management practices. The interventions did not increase anemia, diarrhea, fever, or vomiting, and the ACGG + ATONU group at midline showed reduced risk of fever. Conclusions A chicken production intervention with or without nutrition-sensitive BCC may have benefited child nutrition and did not increase morbidity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03152227.

TI  - Systematic evidence and gap map of research linking food security and nutrition to mental health.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Connections between food security and nutrition (FSN) and mental health have been analytically investigated, but conclusions are difficult to draw given the breadth of literature. Furthermore, there is little guidance for continued research. We searched three databases for analytical studies linking FSN to mental health. Out of 30,896 records, we characterized and mapped 1945 studies onto an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM). In these studies, anthropometry (especially BMI) and diets were most linked to mental health (predominantly depression). There were fewer studies on infant and young child feeding, birth outcomes, and nutrient biomarkers related to anxiety, stress, and mental well-being. Two-thirds of studies hypothesized FSN measures as the exposure influencing mental health outcomes. Most studies were observational, followed by systematic reviews as the next largest category of study. One-third of studies were carried out in low- and middle-income countries. This map visualizes the extent and nature of analytical studies relating FSN to mental health and may be useful in guiding future research.

TI  - Oceans and society: feedbacks between ocean and human health.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The concentration of human population along coastlines has far-reaching effects on ocean and societal health. The oceans provide benefits to humans such as food, coastal protection and improved mental well-being, but can also impact negatively via natural disasters. At the same time, humans influence ocean health, for example, via coastal development or through environmental stewardship. Given the strong feedbacks between ocean and human health there is a need to promote desirable interactions, while minimising undesirable interactions. To this end, we articulate two scenarios for 2030. First, Business-as-Usual, named ‘Command and (out of) Control’, focuses on the anticipated future based on our current trajectory. Second, a more sustainable scenario called ‘Living and Connecting’, emphasises the development of interactions between oceans and society consistent with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We describe a potential pathway to achieving the ‘Living and Connecting’ scenario, centred on improving marine citizenship, achieving a more equitable distribution of power among stakeholders, and more equitable access to resources and opportunities. The constituent actions of this pathway can be categorised into four groups: (i) improved approaches to science and health communication that account for society’s diverse values, beliefs and worldviews, (ii) a shift towards more trusted relationships among stakeholders to enable two-way knowledge exchange, (iii) economic incentives that encourage behavioural changes necessary for achieving desired sustainability outcomes, and (iv) stronger regulations that simultaneously focus on ocean and human health. We contend that these changes will provide improved outcomes for both oceans and society over the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science.

TI  - A mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to measure women's empowerment in agriculture: evidence from Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan
PY  - 2021
AB  - There exists comprehensive literature on women’s empowerment; however, studies on the measurement of empowerment in the agricultural context are scarce, particularly in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Pakistan. In this paper, we used the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which includes five domains, i.e. resources, production, income, leadership, and time, to measure women’s empowerment in the agriculture sector. A survey of 600 rural women and 18 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted by using multi-stage sampling. The results show that about 72% of the women are disempowered, and attribute to low socio-economic conditions, i.e. they have limited access to resources and little leadership skills as rural women in AJK are not free to speak in public. The results further reveal that women are also disempowered in some other indicators, such as autonomy in production, income, and leisure time. So, based on the current findings, it is proposed that government should strengthen these areas through effective policies to improve the status of women.

TI  - Orange-fleshed sweetpotato: Strategies and lessons learned for achieving food security and health at scale in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Against a worsening backdrop of climate stress and population growth, drought-resistant, highly adaptable, nutritious orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) stands out as a sustainable food crop that supports household resiliency, food security, and health. Recognized as one of the cheapest sources of vitamin A (VA), OFSP holds promise as a food-based approach to combat VA deficiency, a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Because the dominant white-fleshed varieties have no beta-carotene, research initiated in the mid-1990s set out to adapt, develop, and promote VA-rich OFSP as a more nutritious alternative to non-OFSP types. Multisectorial strategies that integrate agriculture with health or education sectors hold promise as effective strategies to ensure OFSP reaches and meets the needs of those populations at greatest risk of VA deficiency – pregnant and lactating women, infants, and children. In this article, we share experiences, findings, implementation challenges, and lessons learned from four integrated programs in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Ethiopia that aimed to improve the nutrition and health of women and children with production and promotion of OFSP. Across these projects, households significantly increased OFSP production. In all but one, changes in OFSP production were accompanied by improved food security and maternal and child diets.</jats:p>

TI  - Measurement of benefits in economic evaluations of nutrition interventions in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Economic evaluation of nutrition interventions that compares the costs to benefits is essential to priority-setting. However, there are unique challenges to synthesizing the findings of multi-sectoral nutrition interventions due to the diversity of potential benefits and the methodological differences among sectors in measuring them. This systematic review summarises literature on the interventions, sectors, benefit terminology and benefit types included in cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and benefit-cost analyses (CEA, CUA and BCA, respectively) of nutrition interventions in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic search of five databases published from January 2010 to September 2019 with expert consultation yielded 2794 studies, of which 93 met all inclusion criteria. Eighty-seven per cent of the included studies included interventions delivered from only one sector, with almost half from the health sector (43%), followed by food/agriculture (27%), water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (10%), and social protection (8%). Only 9% of studies assessed programmes involving more than one sector (health, food/agriculture, social protection and/or WASH). Eighty-one per cent of studies used more than one term to refer to intervention benefits. The included studies calculated 128 economic evaluation ratios (57 CEAs, 39 CUAs and 32 BCAs), and the benefits they included varied by sector. Nearly 60% measured a single benefit category, most frequently nutritional status improvements; other health benefits, cognitive/education gains, dietary diversity, food security, knowledge/attitudes/practices and income were included in less than 10% of all ratios. Additional economic evaluation of non-health and multi-sector interventions, and incorporation of benefits beyond nutritional improvements (including cost savings) in future economic evaluations is recommended.

TI  - Impact evaluation of a community nutrition and livelihood program on child nutrition in rural Bangladesh.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Given the high prevalence of child undernutrition in Bangladesh, multi-sectoral approaches involving livelihood promotion have potential to mitigate the burden of undernutrition. This study examined the impact of an economic development (ED) program providing poultry assets, gardening skills and saving training added to the Positive Deviant (PD)/Hearth program (PDH/ED), compared to PD/Hearth only (PDH). A total of 1029 children who attended PD/Hearth sessions in September-November 2018 at 6-13 months of age were enrolled in the cohort study in July-August 2019. The cohort, comprised of 532 children in the PDH/ED group and 593 children in the PDH group, was reassessed in November 2020. The program impact on child nutrition, food security, crop production, dietary quality and household income was estimated using a difference-in-differences approach accounting for the sociodemographic differences between PDH/ED and PDH groups. Compared to the PDH group, the PDH/ED group showed increases in child dietary diversity score (DDS) (+0.32), child minimum dietary diversity (13.7 percentage points [pp]), and maternal DDS (+0.28) (all p < 0.05). From 2019 to 2020, the PDH/ED households improved food security by 12.6 pp and diversified crop production (bananas (9.7 pp), papaya (11.1 pp), carrots (3.8 pp) and lemons (5.9 pp)), and increased the proportion of annual income ≥60,000 Taka by 12.4 pp and last month income ≥5000 Taka by 7.8 pp, compared to PDH group (all p < 0.05). However, there was no impact on child nutritional status, morbidity, livestock ownership and total annual/last income. Incorporating an ED program into nutrition programming could benefit food security and dietary diversity in rural Bangladesh.

TI  - Homegarden diversity and food security in southern Mexico
PY  - 2021
AB  - Home gardens are recognised in the literature for their contribution to food security, yet the process by which agrobiodiversity and household characteristics mediate this relationship is less well understood. This paper contributes to fill this research gap by drawing on a multi-site case study in the Yucatan region in Mexico. By applying regression analysis, the significance of the association between home garden diversity and food security is confirmed. Plant diversity is found to have a positive association with food consumption scores and the frequency of vegetable intakes. The number of animals used for food purposes is also found to have positive and significant associations with food consumption scores and frequency of meat intakes. However, the dimension and the significance of these positive associations were found to vary among communities and quantiles of the distribution of food security measures. In the households studied, younger individuals and better-educated people, males and Spanish speakers were more likely to engage in jobs in urban areas. Engagement in urban jobs was found to involve complementarities with the overall plant diversity of home gardens, but also trade-offs with the diversity of vegetables and other herbs used for food purposes and with the abundance of animals raised for food purposes.

TI  - 'Getting the Right Nutrients to Those Who Need Them Most': towards nutrition-sensitive governance of fisheries in the Global South
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Here we propose a framework and agenda for nutrition-sensitive governance (NSG) of fisheries that rethink dominant paradigms of fisheries governance and propose measures to incorporate nutrition-related objectives into fisheries governance. Fish, rich in micronutrients, have potential for improving the nutritional status of coastal and riparian communities, particularly in the Global South where inadequate nutrition is prevalent. Yet, the potential for fish to alleviate malnutrition remains limited to policy documents and high-level government commitments. We propose an agenda for NSG in the Global South grounded in three main pillars: 1-extending the boundaries of fisheries governance, 2-integrating multiple forms of knowledge, and 3-prioritizing domestic and local needs; each of these pillars links different levels of governance starting at the level of conceptualization and images connected to what fisheries are and should do, to a more policy-oriented level with hands-on recommendations, through an intermediate level that links the two. Overall, we propose a concept and agenda for NSG grounded in a human-centred approach to fisheries governance with social sciences playing a crucial role in unearthing the nodes of power that limit access and agency of poor and vulnerable (fishing) communities to the nutritional benefits of fish. In doing so, we critically analyze dominant fisheries governance agendas (‘Blue Economy’, ‘Blue Growth’) through the lens of food and nutrition security and anchor these debates to the objective of <jats:italic>getting the right nutrients to those who need them most</jats:italic>.</jats:p>

TI  - Factors influencing the sustainability of homestead vegetable production intervention in Rufiji, Tanzania: A cross-sectional mixed methods study.
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is growing evidence that home vegetable gardening interventions improve food security and nutrition outcomes at the family level. Sustainability of many of these community interventions remain a challenge. This study assessed factors influencing the sustainability of homestead vegetable production intervention in Rufiji district, Tanzania, one year after the cessation of external support. This was a community based cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A total of 247 randomly selected women from households who participated in the homestead vegetable intervention were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The study held four focus group discussions with women from households that participated in the intervention, and four In-Depth interviews with two extension workers, one community health worker, and one agriculture district officer. Multiple logistic regression for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data was conducted. About 20.24% (50/247) of households sustained homestead vegetable production for one year after the intervention phased out. Shortage of seeds (adjusted odds ratio = 0.65: CI = 0.46-0.93, p-value 0.018) and either manure or fertilizers (adjusted odds ratio = 1.62: CI = 1.04-2.46, p-value 0.031) were significant factors influencing the sustainability of homesteads vegetable production. In the Focus Group discussions (FGDs) and In-Depth Interview (IDIs), all participating women and extension workers reported high cost of water, destruction from free-grazing animals, agriculture pests and diseases, poor soil fertility, shortage of seeds, and lack of capital affected homestead vegetable production sustainability. Existing individual, community, and system challenges influence the sustainability of external-funded agriculture and nutrition interventions. The study findings underscore the importance of community authorities, scientists, and policymakers in having a well-thought sustainability plan in all promising external-funded interventions.

TI  - Women’s empowerment and farmland allocations in Bangladesh: evidence of a possible pathway to crop diversification
PY  - 2020
AB  - Climate change will likely affect several of the dimensions that determine people’s food security status in Bangladesh, from crop production to the availability and accessibility of food products. Crop diversification is a form of adaptation to climate change that reduces exposure to climate-related risks and has also been shown to increase diet diversity, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and positively affect agro-ecological systems. Despite these benefits, the level of crop diversification in Bangladesh remains extremely low, requiring an examination of the factors that support uptake of this practice. This paper explores whether women’s empowerment, measured using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), leads to increased diversification in the use of farmland. Our results reveal that some aspects of women’s empowerment in agriculture, but not all, lead to more diversification and to a transition from cereal production to other crops like vegetables and fruits. These findings suggest a possible pathway for gender-sensitive interventions that promote crop diversity as a risk management tool and as a way to improve the availability of nutritious crops.

TI  - Sustaining Agriculture and Nutrition Interventions: Continued Engagement of Village Model Farmers in Nepal.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">In homestead food production (HFP) programs, village model farmers (VMFs), after training, implement agriculture and nutrition activities to improve household knowledge and practices. Little evidence exists on what enables VMFs to remain actively engaged and for impacts to be sustained.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE">To examine variables explaining active engagement of VMFs, at least 4 years post-training, in an HFP program in Nepal.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We used cross-sectional data, collected from 2018 to 2019, among 4750 VMFs of <i>Suaahara</i>, a multisectoral nutrition program. We assessed whether respondents registered their HFP group with the local government, conducted regular group meetings, discussed vegetable growing and chicken rearing practices with group members, or engaged in saving and credit activities in their HFP group. Outcome variable was a count of these 4 activities in which the VMF engaged. Socioeconomic, demographic, and programmatic explanatory variables were identified a priori and by bivariate analysis and were adjusted in ordinal regression models accounting for clusters.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">On average, VMFs engaged in 1.4 activities. Having attended primary or secondary school (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] = 1.39), being a female community health volunteer (AOR = 1.27), being from an advantaged caste/ethnic group (AOR = 1.34), receiving additional trainings (AOR = 1.56) and inputs (AOR = 1.31) were associated with more active engagement of VMFs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Village model farmers receiving more training and inputs were more likely to remain actively engaged.

TI  - Identifying effective message-framing techniques in behaviour change communication for healthy diets: An experimental study of promoting biofortified maize adoption in Ethiopia.
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is an increasing interest in using insights from behavioural economics and psychology to influence people's decisions. However, little is known as to how to leverage these insights to inform educational campaigns in the context of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. We help to fill this void by investigating the effect of framed messages (gain vs loss) in stimulating demand for nutritionally enhanced crops. We conducted a field experiment with 648 farmers and found the following key results. First, nutrition education stimulates demand for nutritionally enhanced crops among smallholder farmers. Without nutrition education, farmers are less likely to switch from producing conventional maize to nutritionally enhanced maize. Second, gain-framed messages are slightly more effective: they result in a higher willingness to pay for nutritionally enhanced maize than loss-framed messages. Third, motivational orientations and risk perceptions of individuals moderate the effect of the framed messages.

TI  - Impact and distributional effects of a home garden and nutrition intervention in Cambodia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Home garden interventions combining training in agriculture and nutrition have the potential to increase vegetable production and consumption in lower-income countries, but there remains a need for better evidence for impact. This study contributes to filling this gap by evaluating the impact and distributional effects of a home garden intervention in Cambodia. We used a cluster randomized controlled trial with before and after data for a sample of 500 rural households with children under five and women 16–49 years old. Impact was estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and conditional quantile regressions with non-parametric bounds. The results show that the intervention significantly increased the adoption of nearly all promoted gardening methods. More households (+ 35%; <jats:italic>p &lt; </jats:italic>0.01) produced vegetables, and the production period was extended by five months on average. One-month recall data show an increase in vegetables harvested (+ 25 kg; <jats:italic>p &lt; </jats:italic>0.01) and consumed (+ 10 kg; <jats:italic>p &lt; </jats:italic>0.01) from the garden. Quantile regressions confirm these findings and show that nearly all households benefitted, but households that were already doing better at baseline tended to benefit more. Seven-day recall data show an increase in the quantity of vegetables consumed (+ 61 g/day/capita; <jats:italic>p &lt; </jats:italic>0.01) and an increased quantity of vitamin A, folate, iron, and zinc contained in these vegetables. Women contributed more to the garden work than men and their time spent in the garden increased by 29 min/day on average. These results add further evidence that integrated home garden interventions can contribute to nutrition outcomes and that almost all participants can benefit.</jats:p>

TI  - Intra-household decision-making, production diversity, and dietary quality: a panel data analysis of Ethiopian rural households
PY  - 2020
AB  - Considering that rural poor are mostly subsistence farmers, it seems plausible that production diversity could lead to better nutrition for these farmers. The association between production and dietary diversity is complex, and this complexity demands rigorous empirical analyses and more attention to gendered aspects of intra-household decision-making. We employ panel data analyses of 363 Ethiopian smallholders surveyed in 2014 and 2016 to test for this phenomenon, and to explore the association of women’s participation in decision-making with both production and consumption diversity. Results show that, diversification can be a strategy to improve the diets, but only of rural poor who have limited non-farm income, who are distant to the markets and mostly subsistence oriented. Moreover, female participation in decision-making associates with higher diversity both in terms of production and consumption, but it does not modify the magnitude of the association between production and dietary diversity. Our analyses contribute to the enriching literature on the linkage between production diversification and dietary diversity. We study this complex relationship in-depth and show that the gendered aspect of intra-household decision-making is an important covariate for both production diversity and dietary quality.

TI  - Co-Benefits of Largescale Organic farming On huMan health (BLOOM): Protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled evaluation of the Andhra Pradesh Community-managed Natural Farming programme in India.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The BLOOM study (co-Benefits of Largescale Organic farming On huMan health) aims to determine if a government-implemented agroecology programme reduces pesticide exposure and improves dietary diversity in agricultural households. To achieve this aim, a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled evaluation of the Andhra Pradesh Community-managed Natural Farming (APCNF) programme will be conducted in 80 clusters (40 intervention and 40 control) across four districts of Andhra Pradesh state in south India. Approximately 34 households per cluster will be randomly selected for screening and enrolment into the evaluation at baseline. The two primary outcomes, measured 12 months post-baseline assessment, are urinary pesticide metabolites in a 15% random subsample of participants and dietary diversity in all participants. Both primary outcomes will be measured in (1) adult men ≥18 years old, (2) adult women ≥18 years old, and (3) children <38 months old at enrolment. Secondary outcomes measured in the same households include crop yields, household income, adult anthropometry, anaemia, glycaemia, kidney function, musculoskeletal pain, clinical symptoms, depressive symptoms, women's empowerment, and child growth and development. Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis with an a priori secondary analysis to estimate the per-protocol effect of APCNF on the outcomes. The BLOOM study will provide robust evidence of the impact of a large-scale, transformational government-implemented agroecology programme on pesticide exposure and dietary diversity in agricultural households. It will also provide the first evidence of the nutritional, developmental, and health co-benefits of adopting agroecology, inclusive of malnourishment as well as common chronic diseases.

TI  - Nutrition in contemporary Zimbabwe: a situational analysis: Nutrition situation in Zimbabwe
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>Background: Malnutrition in all its forms continues to be a global public health challenge affecting mostly women and children in Africa. The socioeconomic consequences of poor nutrition are far-reaching and cross-generational. Objective: To provide an update on the nutrition situation in Zimbabwe in the context of the United Nations 2030 sustainable development agenda. Key findings: In Zimbabwe, the leading nutrition problems include high levels of childhood stunting, micronutrient deficiencies (Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, and Selenium) affecting mostly children younger than 5 years and women aged 15-49 years. This paper presents evidence on the emergence of obesity and associated complications like diabetes, hypertension, and several cancers in addition to the traditional problem of undernutrition burden “multiple burden of malnutrition”. These nutrition challenges can be attributed to poor breastfeeding and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, the low dietary diversity affecting mostly rural households and nutrition transition. Cultural and religious beliefs are barriers to the adoption of appropriate breastfeeding and IYCF practices. Conclusion: The multiple burden of malnutrition exists in Zimbabwe. Although there is political, commitment and multisectoral initiatives to address malnutrition and food insecurity, the declining socio-economic situation and the COVID-19 associated restrictions are worsening the situation and poor households are getting more vulnerable. Considering that Zimbabwe’s economy is agriculture-based there is a need to put emphasis on promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture initiatives and urgently implement the Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) to propel the adoption of healthy lifestyles and dietary behaviors. Keywords: Stunting, Breastfeeding, IYCF, Micronutrient deficiency, SDGs, COVID-19, Zimbabwe.</jats:p>

TI  - Integrated food-based multi-actor approach to combat malnutrition
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Despite initial progress, overall development toward zero hunger is not promising. Combating all forms of malnutrition is a complex challenge that requires complex answers from the local to global scales. To support a common understanding and to develop a joint approach that adequately addresses these challenges, an expert panel discussion was organized during the “Nutrition for Growth Summit Tokyo” on (7–8) December 2021 entitled “Multi-sectoral systems approach to holistically tackle malnutrition” upon which this article is based. We highpoint the requirement for actual access to ideas that move beyond the abstract and mostly figurative acknowledgment of the importance of bringing all actors together to combat malnutrition. Four entry points for a food-based multi-sectoral system approach to holistically tackle the burden of malnutrition were agreed upon. These entry points are not discrete, single entities but rather require integrated approaches. While we argue for an integrated approach building on all four interlinked components, it is important to note that the degree of each component's integration is context-dependent and that the examples presented as possible implementation strategies do not apply to all countries alike.</jats:p>

TI  - Measuring women's empowerment in agriculture, food production, and child and maternal dietary diversity in Timor-Leste
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Women’s empowerment is essential to improve nutrition in low and middle-income countries. We investigated the empowerment of women in agriculture in association with household production and the dietary diversity of children 12–59 months old and their mothers in Timor-Leste. Using the Abbreviated Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI) we analyzed 156 dual-adult rural households applying multivariable regression models. We found that the dietary diversity scores of empowered women and their children were higher than among those disempowered. The associations between different measures of empowerment and dietary diversity were larger and more significant among women than children. Food production diversity was consistently associated with children’s improved diets. We found small gender gaps in decisions on production, access to resources, and control over income, similar to findings in other Southeast Asian countries. Nutrition-sensitive policies and programmes in Timor-Leste could gain from prioritizing women’s empowerment and promoting agriculture diversification strategies as valuable investments to improve the diets and wellbeing of mothers and children.

TI  - Empowering rural service providers to improve nutrition in mountain regions
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Improved agroecological practices tend to lead to production diversity but often fall short of achieving optimal dietary diversity in rural contexts. Thus, multi-prong interventions involving knowledge and skill development for production and consumption are needed. This study assesses nutrition and production-related interventions implemented in the East African Highlands, Pamir-Tian Shan, Hindukush and the Andes. Overall, 601 rural service providers were trained and supported to implement various nutrition-sensitive agroecological interventions. Study results show that these interventions significantly increased the intake of flesh food, eggs, vitamin A-rich leafy greens, and vitamin-A-rich vegetables and fruits. The increase in production diversity was correlated with the increase in dietary diversity. Thus this study highlights the crucial role of rural service providers in catalyzing nutrition-related changes in mountain contexts.</jats:p>

TI  - Factors associated with diet diversity among infants and young children in the Eastern and Southern Africa region.
PY  - 2023
AB  - This study explores common factors associated with not meeting minimum dietary diversity (MDD) among 27,072 children aged 6-23 months in Eastern and Southern Africa using data from nine Demographic and Health Surveys from 2013 to 2016. MDD was defined as consumption of more than or equals to five of eight food groups including breast milk in the past 24 h. Equity gaps were calculated as the difference in MDD prevalence between the top and bottom wealth quintiles. Logistic regression was conducted to identify common factors for not meeting MDD at the household, maternal and child levels across two or more countries to inform regional policies to improve children's diets. Kenya had the highest MDD wealth equity gap (40.4 pts), and South Africa had the smallest (14.4 pts). Equity gaps for flesh foods or eggs (up to 39.8 pp) were larger than for grain or legumes (up to 20 pp). Common risk factors for not reaching MDD included younger child age (6-11 months) (n = 9 countries), no formal maternal occupation (n = 6), not receiving vitamin-A supplementation (n = 3), younger maternal age (n = 3), lower maternal education (n = 3), no media (n = 3) or newspaper (n = 3) exposure, lower household wealth quintile (n = 3), use of nonefficient cooking fuel (n = 2), longer time to get to the water source (n = 2), not listening to the radio (n = 2) and higher birth order (n = 2). Priorities for improving MDD in the region include introducing diverse foods at a young age from 6 months with early nutrition counselling, promoting higher maternal education, increasing food purchasing power and ensuring the support of younger mothers.

TI  - Empowerment and nutrition in Niger: insights from the Women’s Empowerment in Nutrition grid
PY  - 2021
AB  - Niger, one of the most impoverished countries in the world, has fared consistently poorly on a range of human development indicators, including women’s nutritional status. A combination of nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions that also address women’s empowerment is essential to address nutritional goals, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Yet, there is not much clarity on what sectors policy makers should target. To identify the aspects of women’s empowerment that are associated with nutritional outcomes in Niger, we present a novel application of a regression decomposition technique, the Shapley-Owen decomposition. After categorizing the drivers of undernutrition into a series of domains (food, health, fertility and institutions) and dimensions (knowledge, resources, and agency), we predict women’s body mass index and anemia status based on these domain-dimensions and other controls using Demographic and Health Survey data. We find that access to health resources and fertility resources play a substantial role in women’s nutritional outcomes in Niger. By identifying the relative contribution of each domain-dimension, our approach offers a unique insight into what sectors are most closely related to the nutritional status of Nigerien women and can aid in identifying interventions that both empower women and improve nutritional wellbeing.

TI  - Nutrition-sensitive Agriculture – Is it possible in Morogoro Rural District? Awareness and practices among farmers
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>According to FAO (2017), nutrition-sensitive agriculture is an approach that seeks to ensure the production of a variety of affordable, nutritious, culturally appropriate and safe foods in adequate quantity and quality to meet the dietary requirements of populations in a sustainable manner. This study focused on analyzing ways in which the concept is implemented and assessing its awareness among the key nutrition stakeholders. These included government officials from village, ward and district levels, NGOs, agriculture inputs suppliers, food vendors and grain millers. Cross - sectional study design was employed and information from respondents were collected by using semi-structured questionnaires, key informant interviews and transect walk. Data analysis was conducted by using SPSS version 20. It was found that home gardening (85.3%) and livestock keeping (57.4%) were the most practiced ways of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. Other ways, including use of biofortified crops, fish farming, use of watering techniques in production of fruits and vegetables, use of soil fertility conserving techniques and using improved food crop varieties were hardly practiced. Above 90% of household heads knew the importance of agriculture to nutrition being a source of food for household consumption, a source of income and employment, makes easy to access nutrient dense foods in the household and ensuring food security. The study also observed high awareness about the concept even though, the actual implementation was low. It was concluded that, low economic status among the rural poor farmers is the major reasons that have led to the observed low practices of other studied ways of agriculture that are nutrition sensitive. It is recommended that, all key stakeholders should work together to subsidize seeds and other agro-inputs which are needed by the farmers to practice these ways.</jats:p>

TI  - Escaneamento de políticas públicas brasileiras de alimentação a partir do Nourishing Framework
PY  - 2022
AB  - A obesidade é considerada uma doença multifatorial e complexa. Devido à dimensão que a doença tomou nos últimos anos, deversos pesquisadores, governos e instituições internacionais, como a WHO e a FAO, tem direcionando esforços para compreender os fatores que influenciam o aumento dos cados da doencça, bem como no desenvolvimento de estratégias que possam controlá-la e previní-la. Visando compreender e apontar caminhos para formulação de políticas públicas relacionadas a obesidade, o World Cancer Researchi Fund International (WCRF) desenvolveu o Nourishing Framework, uma abordagem que possibilita o escaneamento das políticas relacionadas à alimentação, sendo este dividido em três domínios (ambiente de alimentos, sistema alimentar e comunicação para mudança de comportamento). O objetivo desta pesquisa foi analisar as Políticas Públicas Brasileiras de Alimentação (PPBAs) foi realizada em sites governamenatais no período de 2003-2007, resultando em 8 documentos. A análise de conteúdo dos documentos foi operacionalizada com o auxílio do Software QDA Miner. Os resultados apresentaram certa convergência das PPBA com os domínios ambiente de alimentos, comunicação para mudança de comportamento e sistema alimentar sendo este o domínio menos frequente.

TI  - IGARSS - HyNutri: Estimating the Nutritional Composition of Wheat from Multi-Temporal Prisma Data
PY  - 2021
AB  - The goal of this work is to investigate the potential of PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) hyperspectral data to predict the concentration of four macronutrients (K, P, N, S) and four micronutrients (Ca, Fe, Mg, Zn) in final wheat production. All investigated nutrients are essential to improving human nutrition. The initial findings indicate accurate predictions for Zn, P, Mg, S, K, Ca and Fe (R2 ranging from 0.57 to 0.74). N was less accurately estimated (R2 of 0.49). We conclude that the foliar chemical properties and temporal dynamics as detected by hyperspectral data translate successfully to the target micro- and macronutrients composition of the wheat production.

TI  - Food taboos, health beliefs, and gender: understanding household food choice and nutrition in rural Tajikistan
PY  - 2019
AB  - Household nutrition is influenced by interactions between food security and local knowledge negotiated along multiple axes of power. Such processes are situated within political and economic systems from which structural inequalities are reproduced at local, national, and global scales. Health beliefs and food taboos are two manifestations that emerge within these processes that may contribute beneficial, benign, or detrimental health outcomes. This study explores the social dimensions of food taboos and health beliefs in rural Khatlon province, Tajikistan and their potential impact on household-level nutrition. Our analysis considers the current and historical and political context of Tajikistan, with particular attention directed towards evolving gender roles in the wake of mass out-migration of men from 1990 to the present. Considering the patrilieneal, patrilocal social system typical to Khatlon, focus group discussions were conducted with the primary decision-making groups of the household: in-married women, mothers-in-law, and men. During focus groups, participants discussed age- and gender-differentiated taboos that call for avoidance of several foods central to the Tajik diet during sensitive periods in the life cycle when micronutrient and energy requirements peak: infancy and early childhood (under 2 years of age), pregnancy, and lactation. Participants described dynamic and complex processes of knowledge sharing and food practices that challenge essentialist depictions of local knowledges. Our findings are useful for exploring entaglements of gender and health that play out across multiple spatial and temporal scales. While this study is situated in the context of nutrition and agriculture extension, we hope researchers and practitioners of diverse epistemologies will draw connections to diverse areas of inquiry and applications.

TI  - Gendered differences in crop diversity choices: A case study from Papua New Guinea
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Crop choice, including the conservation of traditional crops and the uptake of novel ones, is a central issue in agricultural development. This paper examines differences between male and female farmers’ motivations for growing diverse crop portfolios in Papua New Guinea, a highly agro-biodiverse context facing rapid social change. Q methodology, a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach, is used to examine how alignment with different viewpoints related to crop diversity differs across male and female farmers. We show that, of five distinct ‘types’ of farmers identified with regards to crop diversity choices, all include both men and women, and three of five groups show no significant gender-related differences. However, there are also some significant gender differences. A large proportion of women farmers associate with being highly motivated by crop marketing, whereas male farmers are more likely to favor agricultural diversity due to tradition or status motivations. Overall, strict gendering of crops does not appear highly salient. The results confirm earlier work in the region on women’s roles in marketing but contrast to those on crop gendering. Altogether, they underline the complexity of gender and identity in agricultural choices. The results also have implications for the targeting and implementation of crop conservation and promotion policies and programs, including those aiming for improved nutrition or agricultural development.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The review aims to examine and synthesise the state of the evidence around what works to improve productivity, income, nutrition and women's empowerment outcomes of households involved in aquaculture in low- and middle-income countries. We are particularly interested in addressing the following research questions: (1) Do aquaculture interventions increase the productivity, income, nutrition and empowerment of individuals engaged in aquaculture and their households in low- and middle-income countries? (2) Do aquaculture interventions generate income and nutrition spillover effects beyond the farmers' households? (3) To what extent do the effects of aquaculture interventions vary by intervention type, population group, and location? In particular, to what extent do effects vary by gender? (4) What are the potential barriers and facilitating factors that impact the effectiveness of aquaculture interventions? (5) What is the cost-effectiveness of different aquaculture interventions focused on productivity, income, nutrition and empowerment outcomes?

TI  - What are the links between tree‐based farming and dietary quality for rural households? A review of emerging evidence in low‐ and middle‐income countries
PY  - 2022
AB  - In most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), conventional agricultural policy promotes specialized production systems of carbohydrate-rich crops to address hunger and food insecurity. For rural populations, however, increased landscape uniformity can reduce both agrobiodiversity and wild biodiversity, which can contribute to diet uniformity. Although maintaining diversity in and around agricultural systems is far from a new approach, there is growing empirical attention on the contribution of trees on/around farms to dietary quality. While recent research suggests that forests can contribute to improved diets, there is only emerging evidence on how incorporating trees into farming systems not only benefits nature but also positively affects the diets of rural households. This review synthesizes the existing empirical research on the linkages between different types of tree-based farming systems and indicators of dietary quality in LMICs. The objective is to build a foundation for future research that supports sustainable production systems with dual benefits for people and the natural environment. The small, yet heterogeneous literature pool (n = 36 studies) reflects the high variance in how trees on/around farms are examined across cultural and geographical contexts. Our analysis identifies three major outcomes: (a) managing tree-based farming systems for both direct provision of wild and cultivated foods, as well as income used to purchase foods, may give households more strategies for dietary diversification and improve dietary quality; (b) the relationship between different tree-based farming systems and dietary quality is moderated by socio-economic and biophysical factors at the national, landscape and household levels; and (c) indigenous populations engaged in traditional forms of subsistence-oriented tree-based farming seem to maintain high levels of dietary diversity, indicating the importance of local knowledge and biodiversity stewardship to maintain these food sources in the face of commercial agricultural expansion. Our synthesis of existing evidence highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of how different types of tree-based farming systems contribute to dietary quality. Combining research methods from the domains of agriculture, forestry and nutrition can lead to more precise measurement of tree-based farming/diet linkages, and in doing so, support programs promoting increased landscape and dietary diversity in LMICs.

TI  - Fish and Fish-Based Products for Nutrition and Health in the First 1000 Days: A Systematic Review of the Evidence from Low and Middle-Income Countries.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Fish provide essential nutrients for the critical window of growth and development in the first 1000 d of life and are thus an attractive option for inclusion in nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific programming. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for fish and fish-based products for nutrition and health outcomes during the first 1000 d of life in low- and middle-income countries, searching the peer-reviewed and gray literature from 1999 to 2020. Databases included PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, and the Clinical Trials repository. Our search returned 1135 articles, 39 of which met the inclusion criteria. All studies were dual evaluated for risk of bias. Of the included studies, 18 measured maternal health and nutrition outcomes and 24 measured infant/child outcomes (3 measured both). Our search uncovered 10 impact evaluations, all of which measured consumption of fish or fish-based complementary food products in children aged 6-24 mo. We did not find strong evidence for fish consumption in children improving child growth from the impact evaluations; however, the studies were highly heterogeneous in their design and likely underpowered to detect an effect. Results from observational studies were mixed but provided evidence that adding fish to maternal and child diets is associated with improved nutrition outcomes, such as reducing the risk of anemia and improving vitamin D status. Given the nutrient richness of fish and the fact that production is often more environmentally friendly as compared with other animal source foods, more robust evidence is needed on the role of fish consumption in nutrition interventions to inform policy and programming recommendations in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - Impact of a Homestead Food Production program on poultry rearing and egg consumption: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Women and children in Bangladesh face high levels of micronutrient deficiencies from inadequate diets. We evaluated the impact of a Homestead Food Production (HFP) intervention on poultry production, as a pathway outcome, and women's and children's egg consumption, as secondary outcomes, as part of the Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition cluster-randomized trial in Sylhet division, Bangladesh. The 3-year intervention (2015-2018) promoted home gardening, poultry rearing, and nutrition counseling. We randomly allocated 96 clusters to intervention (48 clusters; 1337 women) or control (48 clusters; 1368 women). Children < 3 years old born to participants were enrolled during the trial. We analyzed poultry production indicators, measured annually, and any egg consumption (24-h recall), measured every 2-6 months for women and their children. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using mixed-effects logistic regression models with repeat measures, with minimal adjustment to increase precision. Poultry ownership increased by 16% points (pp) and egg production by 13 pp in the final intervention year. The intervention doubled women's odds of egg consumption in the final year (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.68-3.18), with positive effects sustained 1-year post-intervention (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.16-2.15). Children's odds of egg consumption were increased in the final year (OR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.87-4.95). Poultry ownership was associated with women's egg consumption, accounting for 12% of the total intervention effect, but not with children's egg consumption. Our findings demonstrate that an HFP program can have longer-term positive effects on poultry production and women's and children's diets.

TI  - Micronutrient-sensitive food value chains: A systematic review of intervention strategies and impact pathways to nutritional outcomes
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Knowledge and evidence on how food value chains can deliver nutrition, especially micronutrients, are limited. A deeper understanding of the food value chains as part of agri-food systems approaches addressing hunger and malnutrition through agricultural development may provide pathways for nutrition and health outcomes.. This systematic review was undertaken using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to assess the broad topic of value chains and micronutrients, focusing on interventions and their related impact pathways. Impact pathway interventions improving micronutrient delivery and consumption were classified as production, accessibility, marketing, income, knowledge and behavioral, and finally, women’s empowerment pathways. However, the case study evidence on the micronutrient-sensitive value chains for nutritional outcomes is very scant. This review identified that making value chains micronutrient-sensitive requires a multi-stakeholder, integrated approach as a basis for concerted action among various stakeholders in terms of policy, research, strengthening partnerships and coordination, and information sharing. The review illustrates the scarcity of literature with a focus on the micronutrients in the context of food value chains and developing countries. The food value chain approach offers great potential to unpack the complexity of food systems and identify entry points and pathways for improving nutrition outcomes, especially the micronutrients. Additionally, this review identifies multiple entry points and calls for strong advocacy of nutrition-sensitive value chain approaches to combat hidden hunger.</jats:p>

TI  - Pathways to Improving Nutrition among Upland Farmers through Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture Interventions: A Case from Northern Laos
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>While there is an increased awareness of the role of nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions on nutrition, the studies that investigate holistic pathways from interventions to nutrition outcomes are inadequate. We aimed to understand these pathways to improved nutrition from the Enhancing Nutrition of Upland Farming Families (ENUFF) Project implemented in northern Laos. We applied an embedded case study design by recruiting 101 participants representing implementers, school and private sector representatives, and beneficiaries, of which 34 participated in interviews and 68 participated in 11 FGDs. This was supplemented by a desk review of project documents. We analyzed the data using a directed content analysis across five pathways using a published framework on impact pathways from NSA interventions to nutrition outcomes. The project contributed to nutrition mainly through three core pathways-food production, nutrition and WASH-related knowledge, and agricultural income, supported by strengthening local institutions within the project’s scope. While it is evident that the project contributed to empowering women by saving their time and increasing income, further study is needed to investigate the translation of these aspects to nutrition-related practices. We also suggest the need to sustain the capacity of local institutions and their engagement beyond the project cycle. To enhance the effectiveness of NSA interventions on nutrition, there is a need to design and implement intervention package with multiple pathways and tailored strategies based on nutrition outcomes, the envisaged pathways, geographical context, and factors affecting these.</jats:p>

TI  - How are higher rice yields associated with dietary outcomes of smallholder farm households of Madagascar?
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is widely expected that agriculture would contribute to farmers’ food security and nutrition in developing countries. However, studies that directly explore the link between agricultural productivity and micronutrients intake by farmers are scarce. In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap by exploring two key channels by which agricultural production can influence dietary outcomes: a food consumption pathway and a cash revenue pathway. To achieve this, we used three-years panel data of rice farmers collected in the Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar. The results suggest that rice yield is positively and significantly associated with farmers’ calorie and micronutrients intake, though the observed elasticities are low. Secondly, raising rice yield has a positive significant impact not only on rice consumption but also on the share of the output sold and the cash revenue from rice sales. Lastly, the results suggest that households with higher cash revenue from rice sales purchase more nutritious foods. Therefore, we conclude that the market represents the channel through which increased rice yield translates into improved micronutrient intake. The findings of this study imply that in order to improve farm households’ nutrition through agricultural production, interventions that target yield enhancement should be accompanied by market access measures.</jats:p>

TI  - A Review of Evidence on Gender Equality, Women's Empowerment, and Food Systems
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment in food systems can result in greater food security and better nutrition, as well as more just, resilient and sustainable food systems for all. This chapter uses a scoping review to assess the current evidence on pathways between gender equality, women’s empowerment and food systems. The chapter uses an adaptation of the food system framework to organize the evidence and identify where evidence is strong, and where gaps remain. Results show strong evidence on women’s differing access to resources, shaped and reinforced by contextual social gender norms, and on links between women’s empowerment and maternal education and important outcomes, such as nutrition and dietary diversity. However, evidence is limited on issues such as gender considerations in food systems for women in urban areas and in aquaculture value chains, best practices and effective pathways for engaging men in the process of women’s empowerment in food systems, and how to address issues related to migration, crises and indigenous food systems. While there are gender-informed evaluation studies examining the effectiveness of gender- and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs, evidence indicating the long-term sustainability of such impacts remains limited. The chapter recommends key areas for investment: improving women’s leadership and decision-making in food systems, promoting equal and positive gender norms, improving access to resources, and building cross-contextual research evidence on gender and food systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Simple solutions for complex problems? What is missing in agriculture for nutrition interventions
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract </jats:title><jats:p>Within the nutritionism paradigm, in this article we critically review the marketization and medicalization logics which aim to address the pressing issue of malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries. Drawing from political economy and food system transformation discourses, we are using the popular intervention types of nutrition-sensitive value chains (marketization logic) and biofortification exemplified through orange-fleshed sweet potato (medicalization logic) to assess their outcomes and underlying logics. We demonstrate that there is insufficient evidence of the positive impact of these interventions on nutritional outcomes, and that their underlying theories of change and impact logics do not deal with the inherent complexity of nutritional challenges. We show that nutrition-sensitive value chain approaches are unable to leverage or enhance the functioning of value chains to improve nutritional outcomes, especially in light of the disproportionate power of some food companies. We further demonstrate that orange-fleshed sweet potato interventions and biofortification more broadly adopt a narrow approach to malnutrition, disregarding the interactions between food components and broader value chain and food system dynamics. We argue that both intervention types focus solely on increasing the intake of specific nutrients without incorporating their embeddedness in the wider food systems and the relevant political-economic and social relations that influence the production and consumption of food. We conclude that the systemic nature of malnutrition requires to be understood and addressed as part of the food system transformation challenge in order to move towards solving it. To do so, new evaluation frameworks along with new approaches to solutions are necessary that support multiple and diverse development pathways, which are able to acknowledge the social, political-economic, and environmental factors and drivers of malnutrition and poverty.</jats:p>

TI  - Food systems everywhere: Improving relevance in practice
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Food systems approaches are increasingly used to better understand transitions in diets, sustainable resource use and social inclusion. Moreover, food systems frameworks are also widely used in many recent policy and foresight studies. We assess 32 highly-cited international studies, identifying and comparing differences in the frameworks used for food systems analysis, and discrepancies in the procedures to identify strategies for and performances of food system transformation. We show that the relevance of existing food systems analysis for identifying critical trade-offs and understanding relevant policies and practices for achieving synergies remains limited. While many studies are largely descriptive, some offer more practical insights into and evidence of entry points for food system transformation as well as opportunities for improving multiple food system outcomes (i.e. nutrition and health, environmental sustainability and resilience, social inclusion). We distinguish four different pathways for food system transformation and outline their analytical underpinnings, their views on multi-stakeholder governance, and how they deal with critical trade-offs between multiple food system objectives. We conclude that food systems approaches must be useful to decision makers and performance can only be improved if decision makers have a better understanding of these underlying interactions and dynamics of food systems change.

TI  - Empowerment and nutrition in Niger: insights from the Women's Empowerment in Nutrition grid
PY  - 2021
AB  - Niger, one of the most impoverished countries in the world, has fared consistently poorly on a range of human development indicators, including women’s nutritional status. A combination of nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions that also address women’s empowerment is essential to address nutritional goals, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Yet, there is not much clarity on what sectors policy makers should target. To identify the aspects of women’s empowerment that are associated with nutritional outcomes in Niger, we present a novel application of a regression decomposition technique, the Shapley-Owen decomposition. After categorizing the drivers of undernutrition into a series of domains (food, health, fertility and institutions) and dimensions (knowledge, resources, and agency), we predict women’s body mass index and anemia status based on these domain-dimensions and other controls using Demographic and Health Survey data. We find that access to health resources and fertility resources play a substantial role in women’s nutritional outcomes in Niger. By identifying the relative contribution of each domain-dimension, our approach offers a unique insight into what sectors are most closely related to the nutritional status of Nigerien women and can aid in identifying interventions that both empower women and improve nutritional wellbeing.

TI  - The economic costs of a multisectoral nutrition programme implemented through a credit platform in Bangladesh.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Bangladesh struggles with undernutrition in women and young children. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes can help address rural undernutrition. However, questions remain on the costs of multisectoral programmes. This study estimates the economic costs of the Targeting and Re-aligning Agriculture to Improve Nutrition (TRAIN) programme, which integrated nutrition behaviour change and agricultural extension with a credit platform to support women's income generation. We used the Strengthening Economic Evaluation for Multisectoral Strategies for Nutrition (SEEMS-Nutrition) approach. The approach aligns costs with a multisectoral nutrition typology, identifying inputs and costs along programme impact pathways. We measure and allocate costs for activities and inputs, combining expenditures and micro-costing. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected retrospectively from implementers and beneficiaries. Expenditure data and economic costs were combined to calculate incremental economic costs. The intervention was designed around a randomised control trial. Incremental costs are presented by treatment arm. The total incremental cost was $795,040.34 for a 3.5-year period. The annual incremental costs per household were US$65.37 (Arm 2), USD$114.15 (Arm 3) and $157.11 (Arm 4). Total costs were led by nutrition counselling (37%), agriculture extension (12%), supervision (12%), training (12%), monitoring and evaluation (9%) and community events (5%). Total input costs were led by personnel (68%), travel (12%) and supplies (7%). This study presents the total incremental costs of an agriculture-nutrition intervention implemented through a microcredit platform. Costs per household compare favourably with similar interventions. Our results illustrate the value of a standardised costing approach for comparison with other multisectoral nutrition interventions.

TI  - Water insecurity, food insecurity and social capital associated with a group-led microfinance programme in semi-rural Kenya.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <b>ABSTRACT</b>Social capital predicts many positive health outcomes, including food and water access and sufficiency. Hence, increasing social capital has emerged as one potential strategy to improve food and water security. In this study, we investigate whether social capital generated through participation in a community-based microlending programme based in semi-rural Kenya is associated with water and food insecurity, and explore the interconnectedness of water and food insecurity through mediation analysis. Randomly-selected women participants of the community-based programme (<i>n</i> = 400) were interviewed in June 2018 and again in June 2019. Survey measures included water insecurity, food insecurity and an index of social capital constructs, namely group cohesion, trust, expectations of mutual support, sense of belonging and frequency of attendance in the programme. Random effects linear regression showed that an increase the social capital index was associated with lower water and food insecurity. The mediation analysis indicated that the association between social capital and food insecurity was completely mediated by water insecurity. This study demonstrates the need for further investigation into how social capital-generating programmes can contribute to systems approaches for collaborative food and water security programmes, especially among rural communities in low- and middle-income countries.

TI  - How Could Science–Policy Interfaces Boost Food System Transformation?
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The world’s food systems must be transformed to make healthier diets more accessible for all, while increasing the sustainability and resilience of these systems, as clearly called for in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Scientists and policymakers are among the actors necessary for this transformation. This chapter reviews the importance of the interfaces between science and policy and how these interfaces can become more active and effective. There is no single science—policy interface, but rather many, at different scales, for different functions, addressing different challenges. Strengthening, connecting, and streamlining these interfaces can ensure the consistency and success of food system transformation. To improve science—policy interfaces, the scientific community should (1) generate actionable knowledge, data, and metrics to move beyond obstacles, and address trade-offs and barriers to change, including power asymmetry, path dependency, conflicts of interest, and risk and uncertainty; (2) articulate models, knowledge, and place-based innovations for designing, implementing, and assessing specific transformative pathways—this requires specific arrangements, dialogues, and approaches, including scientific ones; (3) connect expertise mechanisms, such as scientific committees, to address multisectoral and multiscale processes for sustainable development; and (4) strengthen scientific cooperation through major challenge-oriented alliances and programs. Science—policy interfaces can play a decisive role if they are able to dovetail divergent views and overcome polarized debates and sectoral fragmentation. These interfaces must also help us to look ahead and to bridge local and global processes and actions.</jats:p>

TI  - Agriculture-Nutrition Linkages, Cooking-Time, Intrahousehold Equality Among Women and Children: Evidence from Tajikistan
PY  - 2021
AB  - Household-level agriculture-nutrition linkage (ANL) tends to be strong where food markets are imperfect. In such an environment, markets for cooking services may also be imperfect. Nutrition outcomes of household members, including intrahousehold inequality among women and children can depend on a household’s self-production of food and cooking services, provided both by household labors, particularly of women. Using the primary data in Tajikistan, we show that longer cooking-time by women in the household often strengthens household-level ANL and also reduces intrahousehold inequality in nutritional outcomes among women and children. These effects are stronger in areas with lower nighttime light intensity and for households with lower values of cooking assets. In a context where household-level ANL is strong, ANL may also depend on households’ self-production of complementary inputs, including cooking services. This dependence reveals both unique opportunities for and vulnerabilities of ANL for the rural poor.

TI  - Gender in agriculture and food systems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Both women and men are involved in agriculture globally, although their roles differ significantly by region and are changing rapidly. Gender shapes access to productive resources and opportunities, with women having less access to many assets, inputs, and services across a wide range of contexts. These gender differences in resources and opportunities shape the agricultural sector across different types of farming systems. This chapter critically reviews the rapidly growing empirical literature on gender and agriculture in low- and middle-income countries. We first deal with models and measurement, including household models of production and consumption, contrasting models that assume Pareto efficiency with those that do not. We discuss the implications of complex household structures, the neglect of jointness of household decisions, and incomplete risk-sharing within the household. We also discuss advances in measurement and data collection, focusing on measuring assets, decision-making, empowerment, and time use. We then review empirical studies applying gender analysis to production, markets, and well-being outcomes. We review studies on gender gaps in agricultural resources, agricultural productivity, and the gender dynamics of technology adoption. We then examine studies of gendered participation in markets, including impact evaluations of interventions to improve gender equity in marketing schemes. We review the literature on how women's empowerment and gender equality affect nutrition outcomes, and how gender dynamics affect the takeup and impact of nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs. We conclude and identify areas for future work.

TI  - Household animal ownership is associated with infant animal source food consumption in Bangladesh.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Context-specific research is needed on the relationship between household animal production and nutrition outcomes to inform programmes intervening in small-scale animal production. We examined associations between household animal/fishpond ownership and animal source food (ASF) consumption among 6- to 12-month-old infants enroled in the control arm of a cluster-randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh. We measured ASF consumption using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire at 6, 9 and 12 months and assessed household animal/fishpond ownership at 12 months. We developed negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for infant and cluster, controlling for infant age and sex, maternal age, socioeconomic status and season. Models were stratified by a dichotomised maternal decision-making score. Compared with infants in households without each animal type, those with 4-10 and ≥11 poultry consumed eggs 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 1.6) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0) times more, respectively; 2-3 and ≥4 dairy-producing animals consumed dairy 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.7) and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.1) times more, respectively; and ≥12 meat-producing animals consumed meat 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.8) times more. It was unclear whether there was an association between fishpond ownership and fish consumption. Our results did not suggest that maternal decision-making power was a modifier in the relationship between animal/fishpond ownership and ASF consumption. In this South Asian context, strategies intervening in household animal production may increase infant consumption of eggs, dairy and meat, but not necessarily fish. Research is needed on the role of market access and other dimensions of women's empowerment.

TI  - Does Raising Livestock Improve Household Food Security and Child Dietary Diversity in a Rural Region of Madagascar?
PY  - 2023
AB  - Madagascar is one of the poorest countries and has an alarming prevalence of food insecurity and child undernutrition. Most of the Malagasy population live from agricultural activities making livestock a livelihood asset and a source of animal-source foods, especially for smallholder farmers. This study aimed to examine the association between livestock ownership, household food security, and children's dietary diversity in a rural region of Madagascar. Data from a cross-sectional survey of 344 respondents were used to assess the association between household tropical livestock units (TLU) per capita, Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) scores, and dietary diversity scores (DDSs) among children aged 6-23 months. The estimation results from the ordered probit model showed that household TLU per capita is negatively associated with HFIAS scores and positively associated with DDSs among children. Additionally, households with mothers who received information on childcare and nutrition from health facilities and community nutrition agents were more likely to be food secure and have better dietary diversity. Therefore, promoting livestock ownership and strengthening nutrition-sensitive messages focusing on the benefits of raising livestock to mothers from rural Madagascar will likely be effective in improving household food security and nutrition for children.
