TI  - Changes in rainfed and irrigated crop yield response to climate in the western US
PY  - 2018
AB  - As the global population increases and the climate changes, ensuring a secure food supply is increasingly important. One strategy is irrigation, which allows for crops to be grown outside their optimal climate growing regions and which buffers against climate variability. Although irrigation is a positive climate adaptation mechanism for agriculture, it has a potentially negative effect on water resources as it can lead to groundwater depletion and diminished surface water supplies. This study quantifies how crop yields are affected by climate variability and extremes and the impact of irrigation on crop yield increases under various growing-season climate conditions. To do this, we use historical climate data and county-level rainfed and irrigated crop yields for maize, soybean, winter and spring wheat over the US to analyze the relationship between climate, crop yields, and irrigation. We find that there are optimal climates, specific to each crop, where irrigation provides a benefit and other conditions where irrigation proves to have marginal, if any, benefits. Furthermore, the relationship between crop yields and climate has changed over the last decades, with a changing sensitivity in the relationship of soybean and winter wheat yields to certain climate variables, like crop reference evapotranspiration. These two conclusions have important implications for agricultural and water resource system planning, as it implies there are more optimal climate conditions where irrigation is particularly productive and regions where irrigation should be reconsidered as there is not a significant agricultural benefit and the water could be used more productively.

TI  - Differential impacts of an irrigation project : case study of the Swar Dam Project in Yedashe, Bago region of Myanmar
PY  - 2017
AB  - In Myanmar, the government has made a vast investment in the construction of dams to improve crop productivity and to ensure socioeconomic development. This study explores the differential impacts, in terms of socioeconomic conditions, of these investments for paddy farmers in Yedashe Township, in the Bago region in the south-central part of Myanmar. A farm survey among 95 respondents is used to compare the situation before and after the construction of a dam. It is observed that after the installation of the dam, the farmers could practice double rice cropping enabling them to gain higher income. The impact of the dam project on the employment rate, paddy yields and incomes were measured using normalized vector equations. A positive effect on all these factors was observed. The incomes of the farmers increased by benefiting from higher crop productivity, more crops per year, and more benefits over variable costs. However, the return above variable cash costs (RAVCC) and the benefit over cost (BC) ratio of head-end users was significantly higher than that of middle-reach and tail-end users. Therefore, the study additionally explored the problems of unequal water access and farmer-oriented solutions to these problems. The lack of monitoring and management of the irrigation institutions was found to be a major constraint for the development of the irrigation sector. Therefore, efficient utilisation of irrigation water by water-users, and policies as well as investments in the development of irrigation infrastructure need to be emphasised. Key words: Irrigation dam, downscaled water users, disequilibrium, impact assessment.

TI  - Conservation agriculture with drip irrigation: Effects on soil quality and crop yield in sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - The traditional agriculture production system in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) caused significant soil erosion and degradation of soil quality. In addition, dependability of rainfall for irrigation needs limits the crop production. Advanced agricultural practices are thus needed at the local level to sustain the livelihood of smallholder farmers in the region. In this study, conservation agriculture (CA) practice with drip irrigation technology was compared (using field experiments and watershed modeling) with the traditional conventional tillage (CT) practice for its potential in improving soil quality and crop productivity in the region. Biophysical data were collected (2015 to 2017) from a total of 43 paired plots (CA and CT) at four study sites in SSA: Dangishita and Robit in Ethiopia, Yemu in Ghana, and Mkindo in Tanzania. The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was calibrated and validated with reasonable efficiency in simulating crop yields for both CA and CT practices; average PBIAS ≤±12% and ≤±11%, for CA and CT. The impact of the CA system on soil quality (soil carbon [C] and nitrogen [N]) was analyzed based on the well-tested model prediction results. The total C and N were increased under CA across the study sites on average by 6% and 4.1%, when compared to CT over the study period. Both the experiment and model prediction showed that crop yield was significantly improved by CA—on average 37.4% increases across the sites when compared to CT. Conservation agriculture with drip irrigation was an efficient local strategy to improve crop production in the region while enhancing the ecosystem.

TI  - Why invest in minor projects in sub-Saharan Africa? An exploration of the scale economy and diseconomy of irrigation projects
PY  - 2011
AB  - It is well-known that major irrigation projects have a strong scale economy, handicapping irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because of the difficulty in formulating large-scale projects. Using project-level investment cost and performance data of major and minor irrigation projects, this paper examines the causes of the economy of scale phenomenon. We find that strong scale economy exists not only for major but also for minor projects, i.e., small- and micro-scale, projects. This is largely because of the existence of indivisible overhead costs such as high-opportunity-cost human resources for planning, designing and engineering management and supervision. We also find that large differences between major and minor projects in the absolute level of overhead as well as construction costs creates a strong scale diseconomy and results in better performance of minor projects. The advantage of minor projects holds even when their higher risk associated with the water source is taken into consideration. We argue that there is an urgent need to promote irrigation development in SSA through developing minor projects, and to reduce the heavy burden of overhead costs by developing the capacity of human resources at the national, local and farmer levels in the fields of irrigation engineering, irrigation agronomy, institutional development, and micro water management technologies.

TI  - Water productivity of vegetables under modern irrigation methods in oman
PY  - 2012
AB  - Improving water productivity can make a sterling contribution to global food production and poverty alleviation. Groundwater has always been a critical resource for agriculture. Scientific understanding of water productivity can help address water scarcity concerns through more productive use of scarce water resources and higher socio-economic benefits from available water. This study examined the water productivity in the Al Batinah region of Oman using farm-level data. In total 124 crops grown during the 4 years 2005–2008 were examined. Field studies were carried out for 4 years (2005–2008) on 18 field plots to examine yield, inputs, irrigation, costs and economic return of sweet melon, sweet pepper, cabbage and tomatoes grown under drip irrigation vs Rhodes grass grown under sprinkler irrigation using groundwater. The aim was to identify suitable combinations of vegetable crops grown under drip irrigation that can maximize the profitability of the farmers by optimizing water productivity. Results from the 4-year data show that tomato and cabbage performed better than sweet pepper or melon as far as water productivity was concerned, while the drip irrigation method had shown better performance than sprinkler irrigation. Average crop water productivity was estimated at 7.8 and 11.9 kg m‾3 for the cabbage and tomato crops, respectively. The cabbage crop also gave the highest gross return of RO105 for each riyal Omani (RO 1.00 = US$2.59 in June, 2005) of investment in irrigation water. It has also been analysed that the drip irrigation system performed better in terms of crop water productivity and economic water productivity per cubic metre of water applied. So the research results represent decision-making options of vegetable growers at farm scale but also offer important insights for the adoption of the drip irrigation system as well as the design of water policy incentives for irrigation modernization in Oman and other water-scarce regions.

TI  - A Holistic View of Global Croplands and Their Water Use for Ensuring Global Food Security in the 21st Century through Advanced Remote Sensing and Non-remote Sensing Approaches
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper presents an exhaustive review of global croplands and their water use, for the end of last millennium, mapped using remote sensing and non-remote sensing approaches by world’s leading researchers on the subject. A comparison at country scale of global cropland area estimated by these studies had a high R2-value of 0.89–0.94. The global cropland area estimates amongst different studies are quite close and range between 1.47–1.53 billion hectares. However, significant uncertainties exist in determining irrigated areas which, globally, consume nearly 80% of all human water use. The estimates show that the total water use by global croplands varies between 6,685 to 7,500 km3 yr−1 and of this around 4,586 km3 yr−1 is by rainfed croplands (green water use) and the rest by irrigated croplands (blue water use). Irrigated areas use about 2,099 km3 yr−1 (1,180 km3 yr−1 of blue water and the rest from rain that falls over irrigated croplands). However, 1.6 to 2.5 times the blue water required by irrigated croplands is actually withdrawn from reservoirs or pumping of ground water, suggesting an irrigation efficiency of only between 40–62 percent. The weaknesses, trends, and future directions to precisely estimate the global croplands are examined. Finally, the paper links global croplands and their water use to a paradigm for ensuring future food security.

TI  - EFFECTS OF IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT ON RURAL FARMING FAMILIES OF DISTRICT FAISALABAD, PUNJAB, PAKISTAN
PY  - 2016
AB  - Agriculture is an integral component of Pakistan’s economy as sixty-five percent of the population resides in rural areas and their livelihood primarily depends on agriculture. Pakistan has the world contiguous irrigation system. Unfortunately, the farming community is facing severe water shortage. The prime objective of current study was to explore the effects of irrigation water management on crops productivity and socio economic implications for rural farming families of District Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. A study sample of 160 household farmers was selected through multistage sampling techniques. This study explained that the irrigation water management has positive impact on socio economic condition of farming families and crops productivity. Irrigation water management has potential to decrease farmer's expenses for purchasing fuel. At the same time, it can increase income level in the form of high crops yield. Moreover, irrigation water management has capacity to increase soil fertility, increase in cultivated area, decrease in poverty and frustration. Thus, it effects positively on the lives of farming families.

TI  - Assessing the Influence of Conservation Agriculture On Household Wellbeing and Maize Marketing in Tete and Manica Mozambique
PY  - 2013
AB  - In recent years there has been a movement on the part of farmers, governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), and the international community to promote the use of sustainable agricultural practices. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this has translated into programs with the expressed aim of increasing smallholder farmer adoption rates of conservation agriculture (CA). This thesis contributes to the analysis of the adoption of conservation agriculture by smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa by assessing the economic status of CA adopters in the providences of Manica and Tete, Mozambique. Chapter II of the thesis examines the ceteris paribus correlation between smallholder farm household economic wellbeing with the use of conservation agriculture. Household wellbeing indicators are regressed on household demographic attributes, farm management practices, and a variable indicating the CA adoption status of farms. Of particular interest is the association between the use of conservation agriculture practices and a set of composite wellbeing indices comprised of livestock and asset ownership, and housing material quality. The results suggest that, holding other factors constant, CA households have higher wellbeing index scores related to asset ownership and housing material quality, but lower index scores related to livestock ownership. Chapter III of the thesis analyzes smallholder marketing of maize and use of CA by farmers. The chapter examines the factors associated with the likelihood of a household participating in maize markets as a vendor or buyer, and the subsequent quantity of maize transacted. A censored regression model estimates the intensity of market participation because a large number of households do not buy or sell grain. Of particular interest is the correlation between the adoption of CA practices and the likelihood a household sold or purchased maize. Results suggest that households using CA were more likely to sell maize and less likely to purchase maize for household consumption. However, the overall quantities sold by CA adopters and non-adopters were not different. Households using CA also exhibited different maize marketing patterns with transactions more evenly distributed throughout the year, as compared to non-CA households whose transactions were concentrated during times when food was scarce.

TI  - Emerging partnerships in water service provision in Owerri city, Nigeria
PY  - 2012
AB  - The central question of this study is: what should be the approach to municipal water provision in Owerri city? Is it through reliance on the government, NGOs, International actors or the private water investors? For the study both primary and secondary data were obtained and analysed. The study found that though most residents of Owerri city rely heavily on commercial borehole owners and water tanker drivers/water peddlers for their daily supplies, the government through its SWA is in control, and there is an absence of a popularly acceptable regulatory framework/water policy. It also found out water projects by international agencies and donors such as World Bank in water service provision in Owerri city which improved supply in the past also led to the emergence of fragmentation in service provision. The study equally found that, water governance and its institutions in the study area which operated under national and local forces is now tending towards the international. The study recommends that government should have a robust collaboration with the private sector and other community based organizations for its initiated tripartite partnership to be successful.

TI  - Performance of large-scale irrigation projects in sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2021
AB  - After a 30-year hiatus, large-scale irrigation projects have returned to the development agenda in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the magnitude and drivers of past schemes’ performance remains poorly understood. We quantify the performance, measured as the proportion of proposed irrigated area delivered, of 79 irrigation schemes from across SSA by comparing planning documents with estimates of current scheme size from satellite-derived land-cover maps. We find overwhelming evidence that investments have failed to deliver promised benefits, with schemes supporting a median 16% of proposed area, only 20 (25%) delivering >80% and 16 (20%) completely inactive. Performance has not improved over six decades and we find limited relationships with commonly stated causes of failure such as scheme size and climate. We attribute these findings to political and management frameworks underpinning irrigation development in SSA. First, an emphasis on national food security promotes low-value crops, reducing economic viability. Second, proposals are unrealistically large, driven by optimism bias and political incentives. Finally, centralized bureaucracies lack the technical expertise, local knowledge and financial resources to ensure long-term maintenance. Our findings highlight the need for greater learning from past investments’ outcomes if improvements in agricultural productivity and water security across SSA are to be realized. Satellite-based measures of the area irrigated by 79 schemes find a median of only 16% of the proposed area supplied. A quarter deliver over 80% of the proposed area and a fifth are inactive.

TI  - Strategies for improving water use efficiency of livestock production in rain-fed systems
PY  - 2014
AB  - Livestock production is a major consumer of fresh water, and the influence of livestock production on global fresh water resources is increasing because of the growing demand for livestock products. Increasing water use efficiency of livestock production, therefore, can contribute to the overall water use efficiency of agriculture. Previous studies have reported significant variation in livestock water productivity (LWP) within and among farming systems. Underlying causes of this variation in LWP require further investigation. The objective of this paper was to identify the factors that explain the variation in LWP within and among farming systems in Ethiopia. We quantified LWP for various farms in mixed-crop livestock systems and explored the effect of household demographic characteristics and farm assets on LWP using ANOVA and multilevel mixed-effect linear regression. We focused on water used to cultivate feeds on privately owned agricultural lands. There was a difference in LWP among farming systems and wealth categories. Better-off households followed by medium households had the highest LWP, whereas poor households had the lowest LWP. The variation in LWP among wealth categories could be explained by the differences in the ownership of livestock and availability of family labor. Regression results showed that the age of the household head, the size of the livestock holding and availability of family labor affected LWP positively. The results suggest that water use efficiency could be improved by alleviating resource constraints such as access to farm labor and livestock assets, oxen in particular.

TI  - Small-scale irrigation scheme governance - poverty nexus: evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigated agriculture has been popularized as a key factor to improve crop yields and enhance food security in Africa. However, empirical findings are mixed. This study analyzes determinants of small-scale irrigation adoption and the impact this may have on food security in Ethiopia, where agricultural land is extremely fragmented and densely populated. Data were collected from 240 farmers, and the findings from the survey were triangulated with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. First, the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices indicated high poverty levels among farmers without access to irrigation. Second, accounting for a self-selection bias by using the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model, scheme governance, perceived water scarcity, and access to information were found to have significant effects on the adoption of irrigation schemes. Model estimates further indicated that access to small-scale irrigation resulted in better living conditions for both current users and non-users when compared to their counterfactual situations. Farm income of the user households would decrease by 42% (birr 151,419 or US$ 5,500 per ha) had they not used irrigation. Similarly, farm income of the non-users would increase by 149% had they used irrigation. Per adult equivalent consumption expenditure has also shown a decrease of 35% for irrigation users and an increase of 40% for non-users compared to their respective counterfactual situations. We conclude that much of the perceived water scarcity level is attributed to existing governance regimes more than the physical scarcity of water. The study draws several implications for household food security and local-based water use policies.

TI  - Sustainable development in East Africa: impact evaluation of regional agricultural development projects in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda
PY  - 2020
AB  - Investments in agricultural technologies, capacity building and policy harmonization are needed to support sustainable development across Africa. Regional development projects can facilitate the adoption of agricultural technologies and innovations across nation‐state borders and generate benefits for shared prosperity. This paper uses panel data from 1,160 smallholder households including beneficiaries and non‐beneficiaries from five countries in East Africa ‐ Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. From a pool of over 90 projects implemented over a span of 15 years, 23 regional projects are included in this study. The major economic benefits to smallholder participants are higher crop productivity and income, access to adaptable technologies, access to markets, higher livestock and milk production, gender equality, enhanced food security, resilience and capacity building for uptake and scaling up of future innovation platforms. For example, the adoption of low‐cost tissue culture banana by the beneficiaries increased their incomes by 15% in Rwanda while the adoption of appropriate land and water management technologies increased the potato yields from 2.8 tons (USD 2,840/ha) to over 7.5 tons (USD 7,410/ha) in Kenya. The beneficiaries ensured value added to commodities like bananas (for export) and orange‐fleshed sweet potatoes (a nutrition‐sensitive intervention for enhancing domestic intake of vitamin A) in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Additionally, milk production increased from 6 to 11 L per cow per day in Uganda and from 6 to 8 L per cow per day in Tanzania, with increases in sales generating USD 115 per cow per month above the non‐beneficiaries. These results are supported by previous studies on technology adoption, investments in agriculture and well‐being outcomes. Our findings with the higher farm income Difference‐in‐Differences (DiD) estimator for the female beneficiaries compared to male beneficiaries might have important implications for investing in regional development projects that will close the gender gap in agricultural productivity in Africa. Regional projects can also support post‐conflict development efforts for food security and peace in fragile contexts such as in Burundi. Our findings might serve as an input to the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, localization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to food security and agriculture in Africa and an input to monitoring, evaluation and learning.

TI  - Threats to sustainable development posed by land and water grabbing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Since small-scale farmers manage most of the cultivated land worldwide, the ongoing shift in systems of production associated with large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) may dramatically reshape the world's agrarian landscape, significantly impacting rural populations and their livelihoods. The societal, hydrological and environmental implications resulting from the expansion of large-scale agricultural production, through LSLAs, make their ultimate sustainability questionable. This study, through a literature review, analyses the negative impacts of LSLAs, their hydrological dimension and how they may affect the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The core literature on land and water grabbing is reviewed and systematized using the 17 SDGs as a framework, in order to highlight the relationship between LSLAs and the sustainable development agenda. The magnitude of the global land rush phenomenon and the criticism raised in scholarly research highlight the controversial role that transnational land acquisitions may be playing in the global development agenda.

TI  - Global Change and Investments in Smallholder Irrigation for Food and Nutrition Security in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Investments in irrigation contribute to poverty reduction and enhance food security. This paper considers irrigation investments more broadly in the context of rural–urban linkages and thus examines rural irrigation schemes and peri-urban and urban agriculture using freshwater, groundwater and wastewater. We present case studies from East, West and Southern Africa, while focusing on the imperative of smallholders and of food security and nutrition. Evidence from Big Data and telecoupling show that, amid global change and sustainability issues, irrigation development strengthens connections between humans and nature with notable benefits to food security. Transforming investments to feed the future generation require priority investments in irrigation, solar energy for groundwater pumping, groundwater development policy, and integration of peri-urban and urban agriculture into food systems. Equally important will be no-regret interventions in wastewater reuse, water storage and groundwater buffer, micro-irrigation, and wholesale reconfiguration of farming systems, through anticipatory investments, to safeguard food security and sustainability into the distant future.

TI  - The influence of optimized allocation of agricultural water and soil resources on irrigation and drainage in the Jingdian Irrigation District, China
PY  - 2019
AB  - Reasonable regulation of irrigation and drainage is an important way to decrease water resource waste and water pollution, and to ensure the sustainable utilization of water resources. In this study, appropriate irrigation and drainage methods are proposed by optimizing agricultural water and soil resources based on the current status of water resource utilization in irrigation district in Northwest China, and as much as possible to reduce the amount of irrigation and drainage while ensuring the necessary for salt leaching. A two-layer model was considered to maximize economic benefits and relative production through a nonlinear algorithm to optimize the crop acreage, irrigation quota and the amount of irrigation water at each crop growth stage. A support vector machine regression model for predicting drainage was constructed, including drainage and irrigation, precipitation, evaporation and groundwater depth. Additionally, the amount of drainage water was compared before and after the optimization of irrigation. The amount of irrigation water demand in a wet year (2014), normal year (2008) and dry year (2013) decreased by 23.85 million m3, 12.85 million m3 and 17.50 million m3, respectively, after optimization of the crop planting structure and irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, the net economic benefit increased by 3.76 billion yuan, 1.14 billion yuan and 2.34 billion yuan, as compared with the actual output value. The amount of drainage water decreased by 8.60%, 8.93% and 5.21% compared to that with no optimization in a wet year (2014), normal year (2008) and dry year (2013), respectively. This method can scientifically allocate the amount of irrigation and drainage, feasibly improve economic benefits and prevent soil salinization, thus providing guidance for efficient water resource utilization and ecological protection in arid areas.

TI  - Farm size limits agriculture's poverty reduction potential in Eastern India even with irrigation-led intensification.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="CONTEXT" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Millions of people living in the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) of India engage in agriculture to support their livelihoods yet are income poor, and food and climate insecure. To address these challenges, policymakers and development programs invest in irrigation-led agricultural intensification. However, the evidence for agricultural intensification to lift farmers' incomes above the poverty line remains largely anecdotal.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The main objective of this study is to use a large household survey (<i>n</i> = 15,572; rice: 8244, wheat: 7328; 2017/18) to assess the link between agricultural intensification and personal daily incomes from farming (FPDI) in the rice-wheat systems of the EGP - the dominant cropping system of the region.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We use the Intensification Benefit Index (IBI), a measure that relates farm size and household size to FPDI, to assess how daily incomes from rice-wheat production change with irrigation-led intensification across the EGP.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Relative to the international poverty line of 1.90 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)$ day<sup>-1</sup> and accounting for variations in HH size in the analysis, we found that small farm sizes limit the potential for agricultural intensification from irrigation to transform the poverty status of households in the bottom three quartiles of the IBI. The estimated median FPDI of households with intensified systems in the bottom three quartiles is only 0.51 PPP$ day<sup>-1</sup> (a 0.15 PPP$ gain). The median FPDI increases to 2.10 PPP$ day<sup>-1</sup> for households in the upper quartile of the IBI distribution (a 0.30 PPP$ gain). Irrigation-led agricultural intensification of rice-wheat systems in the EGP may provide substantial benefits for resilience to climatic change and food security but achieving meaningful poverty reduction will require complementary investments.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="SIGNIFICANCE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Transforming the poverty status of most smallholder farmers in the EGP requires diversified portfolios of rural on- and off-farm income-generating opportunities. While bolstering food- and climate security, agronomic intervention programs should consider smallholders' limited monetary incentives to invest in intensification. Irrigation-led agricultural intensification programs and policies should explicitly account for the heterogeneity in household resources, irrigation levels, and degree of dependence on agricultural income.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2023 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation>

TI  - Agricultural water management in the world during past half century
PY  - 2014
AB  - The present paper aims to estimate the areas equipped for irrigation and desirability of agricultural water management in the world. For this purpose, all necessary information was gathered from Food and Agriculture Organization and checked using World Bank Group. The selected 18 indices were analysed for all 26 regions in the area studied, and the extent of area equipped for irrigation to cultivated area was estimated by 2 different formulas and other 9 indices. In addition, an average index was calculated using various methods to assess region conditions for agricultural water management. The results show that Central Asia is the best region for agricultural water management and the value of relative error is less than 20%. The capability of irrigation and drainage systems was studied using other eight indices with more limited information. The results indicated that trial-and-error policies should be avoided and expert comments be applied to irrigation systems for any crop.

TI  - Water governance and patterns of water use to support livelihoods in the Lower Kafue River Basin, Zambia
PY  - 2015
AB  - Water is the primary source of life and livelihoods. The survival of both rural and urban communities depends on water use for agriculture, fishing, livestock, domestic consumption and energy production. To enhance accessibility to the life supporting commodity for all, the water governance system in Zambia has undergone several reforms. The reforms were meant to foster decentralization by devolution of powers to grassroots water institutions and increase participation of rural households in water resource use decision-making process. The main objectives of this study were to determine the level of awareness and participation of rural households in water governance; to document the rural households‘ pattern of consumptive and productive use of water for supporting livelihoods; to document some of the constraints and conflicts related to water use in the lower Kafue River Basin. A review of policy documents and other literature; key informant interviews and a household survey were conducted to collect and analyze data for the study. The study results show that smallholder farmers are key actors in rural water use, particularly water use for agriculture, domestic consumption and fishing. They can significantly influence water use decisions at grass root level. However, the majority of rural households (90%) were not aware of the new water institutions introduced by the Water Management Act of 2011 and the knowledge of their functions was scanty. Moreover, there was limited community participation in water governance. About 97% of the respondents expressed ignorance about community participation in water use decision-making processes at grassroots level The study results further show that, despite the intrinsic value of water, its use by rural households is mired in several constraints. About half of the respondents have access to water resources, but clean and safe water is accessible to only about 19 percent. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 35 percent of respondents using water mainly for subsistence crops such as vegetables and tomato. On the other hand, water use for fishing is limited to natural water bodies which suffer constraints of overfishing owing to use of illegal fishing methods and non-compliance to fishing regulations. The policy implications of these findings are that formulation of new water policy and regulatory frameworks in Zambia is necessary, but the implementation of such policies at end-user level is the most critical in improving accessibility to water resources and improving the livelihoods of rural households. It is of utmost importance that government should make efforts to ensure increased awareness about water sector policy reforms and enhance community participation in water governance institutions in order to effectively implement decentralization policies in the water sector.

TI  - Systems Analysis of Vulnerability to Hydrometeorological Threats: An Exploratory Study of Vulnerability Drivers in Northern Zimbabwe
PY  - 2019
AB  - Disasters result from complex interactions of hazards and vulnerability conditions. Reducing human exposure and sensitivity to threats can reduce disaster impact. Prior knowledge about community vulnerability levels is crucial to minimizing potential losses from future threats. Most vulnerability studies focus on high-impact disasters and their temporal and spatial analyses. Yet high-frequency, low-impact disasters have a cumulative potential to severely disrupt or damage socioeconomic systems. There is limited knowledge especially in the global south about the creation of vulnerability to hydrometeorological threats. Using a systems approach, this study explores ways in which communities in the northern semiarid tropics of Zimbabwe are vulnerable to hydrometeorological threats. This predominantly qualitative study used literature review, interviews, transect walks, and focus groups to gather data from selected samples involving smallholder farmers with in-depth knowledge about community vulnerability. The results show that the communities are vulnerable to multiple hydrometeorological threats due to multiple interacting factors including rainfed and flood-based farming, land tenure, topography, climate, and other socioeconomic conditions such as inadequate income sources and high poverty. In order to reduce vulnerability, this study provides five policy options for government and nongovernmental organization interventions, including the need to transform rural economies beyond the traditional rainfed and flood-based farming systems.

TI  - A hydro-economic analysis of end-of-century climate projections on agricultural land and water use, production, and revenues in the U.S. Northern Rockies and Great Plains
PY  - 2022
AB  - Study region,Montana, U.S.A. Study focus Creating adaptation plans for projected imbalances in the western U.S. agricultural water demand-supply system are difficult given uncertainty in climate projections. It is critical to understand the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of the regional agricultural system and hydrologic impacts of climate change adaptation. We applied a stochastic, integrated hydro-economic model that simulates land and water allocations to analyse Montana farmer adaptations to a range of projected climate conditions and the response of the hydrologic system to those adaptations. Satellite observations of crop types, productivity, water use, and land allocation were used for model calibration. A suite of climate models was employed to quantify end-of-century impacts on streamflows, water and land use, production, and net revenues.New hydrological insights for the region Simulations showed summer streamflows were influenced by a state-wide 18.2% increase in agricultural water use. Decreased summer water availability with increased demand could have far reaching impacts downstream. Land use for irrigated crops increased 1.6%, while rainfed crops decreased 6.5%, implying state-level decrease in planted area. Even with increased land and water use for irrigated crops, production decreased 0.5%, while rainfed production decreased 2.7%. Corresponding losses in net revenues totaled 1.5% and 7.2% for irrigated and rainfed crops, respectively.Results highlight vulnerabilities of semi-arid agricultural regions and can aid water managers in sustaining agriculture in these regions.

TI  - Cost–benefit and water resources policy: a survey
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper reviews recent developments in cost–benefit analysis for water policy researchers who wish to understand the applications of economic principles to inform emerging water policy debates. The cost–benefit framework can provide a comparison of total economic gains and losses resulting from a proposed water policy. Cost–benefit analysis can provide decision-makers with a comparison of the impacts of two or more water policy options using methods that are grounded in time-tested economic principles. Economic efficiency, measured as the difference between added benefits and added costs, can inform water managers and the public of the economic impacts of water programs to address peace, development, health, the environment, climate and poverty. Faced by limited resources, cost–benefit analysis can inform policy choices by summarizing trade-offs involved in designing, applying, or reviewing a wide range of water programs. The data required to conduct a cost–benefit analysis are often poor but the steps needed to carry out that analysis require posing the right questions.

TI  - Implications of water scarcity for economic growth
PY  - 2016
AB  - Global freshwater demand is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, making water one of the most fiercely contested resources on the planet. Water is linked to many economic activities, and there are complex channels through which water affects economic growth. The purpose of this report is to provide background information useful for a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water scarcity on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The paper provides a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and economic growth, and identifies the possibilities and bottlenecks in incorporating water use into a CGE framework. It covers agricultural water consumption, with special attention to irrigation, water use in energy production, and demands for water by households, industry and services. Finally, it discusses water supply and allocation. Based on the evidence assembled, there appear to have been relatively few instances in which water scarcity has significantly slowed the long term rate of national economic growth. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across the board are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. The presence of large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium analysis. But implementation of a global CGE model with detailed representation of water demand and supply will be a significant undertaking. It is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model, treat water as both an input and an output, and add sectoral detail, with special attention to crop irrigation. Furthermore, there are challenges in assigning appropriate values to water and specifying allocation rules for dealing with water scarcity.

TI  - Pros and cons of furrow irrigation on smallholdings in northeast Brazil
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Smallholder farming is the basis of agricultural production in developing regions. Irrigation improves the household livelihood and welfare of smallholders. Furrow irrigation is the most common type of irrigation on the small farms of public irrigation schemes set up in the Northeast of Brazil during the 1970s and 1980s. However, furrow irrigation triggers environmental problems related to deep percolation, runoff and soil erosion. The objective of this research was to determine how soil was lost from irrigation furrows as a result of their management and performance. Experiments were carried out in the Curu-Pentecoste irrigation scheme located in the state of Ceara, Brazil. Three inflow rates (corresponding to the three sizes of syphons used to apply water to the furrows) were compared on 60-m long furrows in the two predominant soil classes (sandy loam and silty clay loam) during 4 or 5 irrigation events throughout the irrigation season. Runoff represented between 20 and 70% of the water applied, carrying sediments amounting up to 2.8 Mg ha−1 in 4 irrigation events. Simple irrigation practices that could improve furrow irrigation performance in the scheme are suggested. However, the environmental problems of the furrow irrigation in practice seem inherent to the irrigation method used under those conditions. The paper discusses the adoption and performance of traditional and modern irrigation technology in smallholdings in developing regions.

TI  - Agricultural water management and poverty in Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The main focus of this article is to explore whether access to selected agricultural water management (AWM) technologies has led to significant reduction in poverty and, if they did so, to identify which technologies had higher impacts. In measuring impact we estimated the average treatment effect for the treated on crop income and measured the differences in consumption expenditures per adult equivalent of those with access and without access using matched data. The estimated average treatment effect was significant and amounted to USD 82 per season. Moreover, there was 24 less poverty incidence among users of AWM technologies compared to nonusers. All technologies were found to have significant poverty reducing impacts with micro dams, deep wells, river diversions, and ponds leading to 37%, 26%, 11%, and 9% reduction in poverty incidence compared to rainfed system. Finally, our study identified the most important correlates of poverty on the basis this we made the policy recommendations to build assets (AWM technologies, livestock, etc); to enhance human resource development and improve the functioning of labor markets for enhanced impact of AWM technologies on poverty.

TI  - Exploring Synergies Between Hardware and Software Interventions on Water Savings in China: Farmers’ Response to Water Usage and Crop Production
PY  - 2012
AB  - Evidence is presented on synergies due to the sequencing and packaging of water reforms based on a review of case studies from the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) in the Yangtze River basin in China. Faced with strategic challenges of economic growth, food security, population growth, and climate change, China has implemented numerous hardware and software interventions in the water sector to increase the availability of water. These interventions—ranging from the provincial and system level to farm and field level—allow reallocation of water from agriculture to higher value uses, without significant reduction in crop production. This review of selected hardware and software interventions suggests that water sector reforms generate significant benefits for peasant farming communities and local governments. The review indicates that all agents respond to the same set of incentives simultaneously, by changing production and resource use decisions such that cumulative benefits from hardware and software interventions reinforce synergies. Synergies from reforms are evident, yet scaling up local collective actions for optimal impact is problematic. Heterogeneity in socioeconomic factors, as well as spatial differences, are the main stumbling blocks. Rewarding reformers seems to work, yet the benefits are neither immediate nor straight forward. Local implementation of national policies requires a systematic and coherent framework suited to the level of economic development of each region in order to achieve synergies from water reforms.

TI  - Developing a Conceptual Model for Sustainable water Resource Management and Agricultural Development: the Case of the Breede River Catchment Area, South Africa.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The complex relationship that exists between water resources and agricultural production has been increasing constantly globally. Several factors are interacting to influence the management of water resources making the system complex and dynamic. To increase the understanding of these complex and dynamic systems, relevant tools are needed to identify the causal relationships that exist between the drivers and their influences on the system. Participatory modelling based on the system dynamics approach provides a simplistic and visualisation tool that can improve the understanding of the functioning of a complex and dynamic system. A multi-stage participatory approach was used in this study involving relevant stakeholders in the development of an integrated conceptual system dynamic model using causal loop diagrams. This approach was used because it captures the thought process and mental model of relevant stakeholders in the development of the model, making it a valuable tool for policy and decision making at government and individual levels. The integrated model built in this study used causal loop diagrams to address problems of water management and agricultural sustainability in the Breede River Catchment. The model shows major causal-relationships and feedback loops that determine the functioning of the overall system. The model demonstrates the usefulness of the participatory approach in solving problems related to water management and agricultural development in the catchment.

TI  - Farmers perceptions, practices and proposals for improving agricultural productivity in South Sudan
PY  - 2018
AB  - This study was carried out to establish farmers’ perceptions regarding low agricultural productivity and to document their ideas for improving the performance of agriculture sector in South Sudan. The results reveal that the major challenges related to low agricultural productivity as perceived by farmers include poor leveling of fields, poor irrigation management, low water availability, loss of land due to salinity and low water use efficiency due to seepage and runoff losses. Low water availability is considered as the biggest challenge for improving agricultural productivity because dependence on seasonal rain results in low crop yields and serious food shortages during most part of a year. Therefore, installation of public wells to increase groundwater availability for irrigation and establishment of rainwater harvesting structures are proposed as the potential solutions to solve irrigation water problems and overcome food shortages. Strengthening of extension services and training of vegetable growers on drip and sprinkler irrigation system along with the provision of irrigation equipment can help a great deal in increasing agricultural productivity. The state and national governments should provide high quality seeds and loans to the vegetable growers to enable them improve their crop production and cultivation of crops during the dry periods. Key words: Agricultural productivity, irrigation management, food security, livelihood, poverty.

TI  - The Political Economy of Maize Production and Poverty Reduction in Zambia: Analysis of the Last 50 Years:
PY  - 2011
AB  - Poverty and food security are endemic issues in much of sub-Saharan Africa. To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger in the region remains a key Millennium Development Goal. Many African governments have pursued economic reforms and agricultural policy interventions in order to accelerate economic growth that reduces poverty faster. Agricultural policy regimes in Zambia in the last 50 years (1964–2008) are examined here to better understand their likely impact on food security and poverty, with an emphasis on the political economy of maize subsidy policies. The empirical work draws on secondary sources and an evaluation of farm household data from three villages in the Kasama District of Zambia from 1986/87 and 1992/93 to estimate a two-period econometric model to examine the impact on household welfare in a pre- and post-reform period. The analysis shows that past interventions had mixed effects on enhancing the production of food crops such as maize. While such reforms were politically popular, it did not necessarily translate into household-level productivity or welfare gains in the short term. The political economy of reforms needs to respond to the inherent diversity among the poor rural and urban households. The potential of agriculture to generate a more pro-poor growth process depends on the creation of new market opportunities that most benefit the rural poor. The state should encourage private sector investments for addressing infrastructure constraints to improve market access and accelerate more pro-poor growth through renewed investments in agriculture, rural infrastructure, gender inclusion, smarter subsidies and regional food trade. However, the financing of such investments poses significant challenges. There is a need to address impediments to the effective participation of public private investors to generate more effective poverty reduction and hunger eradication programmes. This article also explores the opportunities for new public–private investments through South–South cooperation and Asia-driven growth for reducing poverty in Zambia.

TI  - Detecting the linkage between arable land use and poverty using machine learning methods at global perspective
PY  - 2022
AB  - • We investigated the arable land use and poverty links from a global perspective. • Arable land use was assessed from three aspects with support of big geodata. • Non-parametric machine learning methods were applied to explore the linkage. • We find that RAPY, RPCPA and fertilizer consumption were highly related with poverty. Eradicating extreme poverty is one of the UN's primary sustainable development goals (SDG). Arable land is related to eradicating poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2). However, the linkage between arable land use and poverty reduction is ambiguous and has seldom been investigated globally. Six indicators of agricultural inputs, crop intensification and extensification were used to explore the relationship between arable land use and poverty. Non-parametric machine learning methods were used to analyze the linkage between agriculture and poverty at the global scale, including the classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest models. We found that the yield gap, fertilizer consumption and potential cropland ratio in protected areas correlated with poverty. Developing countries usually had a ratio of actual to potential yield less than 0.33 and fertilizer consumption less than 7.31 kg/ha. Overall, crop extensification, intensification and agricultural inputs were related to poverty at the global level. Graphical Abstract .

TI  - Food security status in rural areas of Mizoram, Northeast India
PY  - 2017
AB  - Rural areas of the Mizoram state, India practice subsistence agriculture where shifting cultivation dominates the farming systems. As a result, output from crops is very low and thus, the rural areas suffer from food insecurity. This paper analyses food security status in the rural areas of Mizoram and suggests the measures to attain food security. A case study of 16 villages, lying in all the eight districts of Mizoram, was conducted in 2014 and 1527 households (76%) out of total 2010 households were surveyed through purposive random sampling method. Structured questionnaire was constructed and questions on three food security components and 13 indicators were asked. We used Z score technique to calculate data and finally got a composite score of all the components of food security. Our result shows that food availability in the study villages is very less as composite score stands for 0.003 whereas food accessibility is comparatively higher, mainly due to availability of fair price shops (mean value is one), high agricultural working population (40.1%) and high literacy rate (70.6%). Therefore, its composite score is 0.236. Food stability scores only -0.062 and finally overall food security stands for 0.178, which is inadequate. We have suggested that ‘system rice intensification’, which is already in practice, should be given priority. Adequate irrigation facilities, proper public distribution system, cultivation of fruits and vegetables, value addition in farm products and access to market may achieve food security.

TI  - SCADA platform combined with a scale model of trickle irrigation system for agricultural engineering education
PY  - 2011
AB  - During the last three decades, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are being widely used in agricultural applications and specifically in irrigation management systems, where an intelligent use of the water is required. Taking this objective into account, an educational platform for the design of SCADA applications for irrigation programming combined with a scale model of a trickle irrigation system is described in this article. This platform facilitates the students of Agricultural Engineering to design and simulate different irrigation systems, providing an efficient and low cost tool. Moreover, as the SCADA applications are developed with the LabVIEW graphical programming language, complex mathematical models for irrigation, data sampling, and on-line programming by Internet are supported. The use of a data acquisition card for collecting data from transducers and for the activation of the actuators makes it possible to apply the implemented platform both to a real irrigation system and to the developed scale model, supplying the students with a more practical application of the learned concepts. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Analysing Irrigation Farmers’ Preferences for Local Governance Using a Discrete Choice Experiment in India and Pakistan
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper reports the results of an investigation into the preferences of irrigation farmers for different payment apparatus for irrigation fees. We also report the results of a study that queried farmers’ preferred model for water governance at a local level. The results and analysis thus make an important contribution to the debate about how participatory irrigation might operate more effectively, especially in India and Pakistan. The rationale for this study is that aligning the payment mechanisms and local water governance more closely with farmer preferences is likely to reduce the barriers to accepting participatory irrigation and the requirement to pay water charges. To the knowledge of the authors, no other study has specifically addressed this issue by seeking direct feedback from farmers.

TI  - Irrigation, a productive tool for food security – a review
PY  - 2015
AB  - ABSTRACTWater scarcity in agriculture is becoming a major problem due to increasing demand from nonagricultural uses and intensive crop management on existing croplands to meet the needs of an expanding global population. Efficient use of the available irrigation water is therefore of important concern. Even though intensive research in the areas of crop physiology, irrigation engineering, agronomy and agricultural economics has developed several ways to improve the efficiency of irrigation water, a multidisciplinary approach is often regarded as the best future path to achieve further enhancements in meeting the forthcoming challenge of producing more and safety foods. Failure of irrigation production has profound effects on the welfare of all those employed in it and also their customers. Indeed, the scale of the industry is such that world food prices will be influenced by the overall performance of the irrigation farmers, but low food prices are essential to the welfare of the poorest people.

TI  - SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AND CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN CHINA AND ETHIOPIA: A REVIEW
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The main challenge of agriculture is to ensure food security in line with yield increases and minimize environmental costs due to complex interactions between social, economic, and ecological factors. Here we review to identify the impacts of socio-economic factors on crop production efficiency between China and Ethiopia. To set the economic reform and improve the grain yields in rural China, a series of policies on land reforms from communal systems to tax cancelation and subsidies have been implemented. Similar to China, Ethiopia has also experienced different types of land reform from landlord and peasant structure to land as the common property of nations, nationalities, and peoples of Ethiopia. The Gross Domestic Products per capita trends which represent the mean standard of leaving of residents in a country show almost similar growth in the 1980s while later significant variation was achieved between the two countries. It is suggested that to meet food security and increase agricultural efficiency in Ethiopia better infrastructure development that meets socio-economic demands should be prioritized while in China policies to reduce fertilizer inputs are highly recommended to minimize the environmental costs due to high agricultural inputs for sustainable agriculture growth.</jats:p>

TI  - What role can small-scale irrigation play in promoting inclusive rural transformation? Evidence from smallholder rice farmers in the Philippines
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We investigate how user-managed small-scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation. Cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the Philippines, finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy. We also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals. Based on these findings, we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries.

TI  - Spatial quantification of community resilience in contexts where quantitative data are scarce: The case of Muzarabani district in Zimbabwe
PY  - 2018
AB  - There has been an upsurge in tools for measuring resilience of the past decade. Despite this progress, we argue, there are few studies focusing on the spatial quantification of resilience in the context of multiple hazards, particularly in developing countries. Placing a particular emphasis on the contribution of geography to resilience studies, this paper examines the spatial variation of community resilience to disasters in Muzarabani, Zimbabwe. Place‐specific resilience variables are selected from the 2012 national census report to develop a disaster resilience index for Muzarabani district. A principal component analysis technique was used to analyse the overall and subcomponents of resilience to identify wards that needed policy intervention. Using the Geographical Information Systems tool to model the spatial variation of community resilience and its subcomponents, we found a geographic variation in community resilience across Muzarabani district, with the majority of the wards scoring low to below low levels of overall resilience. Although we view this study as being complementary to qualitative studies, it would appear quantifying and visualising resilience provide possible explanations and actions required for decision‐makers to address the resilience gaps and disaster risk reduction broadly.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Empirical evidence in the literature on the extent to which access to different infrastructure services contribute to enhancing household economic welfare remains limited. Our paper contributes to fill in the gap by assessing the influence of access to public infrastructure on welfare in rural areas of a developing country such as Ghana, taking into account the heterogeneity in household endowment. Based on pseudo panel modelling and using three waves of nation-wide household living standard surveys between 1991 and 2006, the empirical findings suggest that access to public transport, electricity and water infrastructure has important but differential impacts on household welfare.

TI  - Strong Influence of Irrigation on Water Budget and Land Surface Temperature in Indian Subcontinental River Basins
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigation modulates the terrestrial water budget in intensively irrigated regions. However, the influence of irrigation on water budget and land surface temperature (LST) has not been quantified in Indian sub?continental river basins. Here, using the in?situ and satellite?based observations and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with irrigation scheme, we show that the presence of irrigation substantially alters water budget (especially evapotranspiration (ET)) and land surface temperature (LST) in the sub?continental river basins. While irrigation results in increased evapotranspiration (ET) in all the 18 sub?continental basins, mean annual ET of Indus and Ganges basins increases by 47% and 12%, respectively due to irrigation. Total runoff (TR) has increased in the most basins due to irrigation. Irrigation has a remarkable influence on LST with cooling of 0.2?0.65 �C. Compare to other basins; irrigation water demand is high in Indus and Ganges basins during the post?monsoon season (October?January). Our results show that between 1951 and 2012, irrigation demand has decreased in 13 out of the 18 basins during the pre?monsoon season (February?May). However, irrigation water demand increased in 12 out of the 18 basins in the post?monsoon season. Changes in irrigation demands are largely driven by changes in soil moisture due to weakening/strengthening of the summer monsoon precipitation. Our findings have implications for water budget estimation over intensively irrigated basins where ET might be substantially underestimated in the previous studies that do not consider the role of irrigation.by Harsh L.

TI  - Water Service Provision in Owerri City, Nigeria
PY  - 2012
AB  - The study investigates water service provision in Owerri-a Nigerian city. For the study both primary and secondary data were obtained and analysed. Secondary data were obtained from Imo State Water Corporation (ISWC) and the Works Department of Owerri Municipal Council. While, primary data were obtained from all the 17 wards that constitute Owerri city, i.e. the municipal area. Key informants were identified and interviewed using a structured interview schedule. The analysis of variance employed showed that there are significant differences in the water service provision pattern in the seventeen wards in Owerri city. The study found that though most residents of Owerri city rely heavily on commercial borehole owners and water tanker drivers/water peddlers for their daily supplies, the government through its SWA is in control, and there is an absence of a popularly acceptable regulatory framework/water policy. It recommends that Water decree 101 from 1993 (water legislation) be reviewed to address growing challenges. In order to enhance regular water supply at less cost, the study recommends that government should collaborate with the private sector and other community based organizations in a tripartite partnership. A new regulatory framework that will carry out government ownership and control of water resources and participatory aspects of water management should be produced by ISWC.

Using the FAO database, ten indices were selected: permanent crops to cultivated area (%), rural population to total population (%), total economically active population in agriculture to total economically active population (%), human development index, national rainfall index (mm/year), value added to gross domestic product by agriculture (%), irrigation water requirement (mm/year), percentage of total cultivated area drained (%), difference between national rainfall index and irrigation water requirement (mm/year), area equipped for irrigation to cultivated area or land use policy index (%). These indices were analyzed for all 53 countries in the study area and the land use policy index was estimated by two different formulas. The results show that value of relative error is <20 %. In addition, an average index was calculated using various methods to assess countries’ conditions for agricultural water management. Ability of irrigation and drainage systems was studied using other eight indices with more limited information. These indices are surface irrigation (%), sprinkler irrigation (%), localized irrigation (%), spate irrigation (%), agricultural water withdrawal (10 km3/year), conservation agriculture area as percentage of cultivated area (%), percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized (%), and area waterlogged by irrigation (%). Finally, tendency of farmers to use irrigation systems for cultivated crops has been presented. The results show that Africa needs governments’ policy to encourage farmers to use irrigation systems and raise cropping intensity for irrigated area.

TI  - Assessment of Natural Capital for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods: An Empirical Study of Mizoram, India
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> The state of Mizoram has plenty of natural capital in the form of a feasible climate, rich forest, an abundance of water and rich agroecological conditions. However, this capital is not exploited optimally to help the rural people plagued by acute food insecurity there. This study assesses the potential of the natural capital there for creating sustainable rural livelihoods in Mizoram. The analysis has been performed based on the case studies conducted in 16 villages, 2 villages from each district. A total of 1,527 households were surveyed using a purposive random sampling method. A structured questionnaire was designed where the questions were asked to gather information on climate conditions, forests, water and agriculture. The findings reveal that the optimum use of natural capital will enhance rural livelihoods substantially. Tourism development, the establishment of forest-based small-scale industries in rural areas, rainwater harvesting, construction of micro hydroelectricity power projects, and cultivation of diverse crop races/cultivars, including food grains, vegetables and fruits, along with systematic rice intensification in the suitable agroecological zones can bring a momentum to expedite rural livelihoods there. </jats:p>

TI  - Gradient effect on farmers’ income in the mountain areas and its implication for poverty alleviation strategies: Empirical analysis from the upper reach of Minjiang River, China
PY  - 2012
AB  - Using four types of settlements in the upper reach of Minjiang River as case, we establish structural models in farmers’ income of different settlement patterns based on rural household panel data to reveal the gradient effect on farmers’ income and determinants. The results indicate that: (1) except the resettlement area, the incomes for farmers living in river valley, semi-mountain, and high-mountain settlements present a decreasing trend with the elevation increasing; on the contrary, their nonfarm earnings show an increasing trend with the elevation decreasing; (2) from the effect on farmers’ income, there is a common feature that the nonfarm earnings and farming incomes have significant positive effects, and family size and productive expenditure have significant negative effects. One exception to this is the productive expenditure, which becomes insignificant in the model of resettlement area; (3) from the way of increasing farmers’ income and alleviating poverty, there are great differences for four types of settlements in mountain areas, however, the improvement of agricultural product sales, agricultural production subsidies, the expansion for nonfarm employment, and the control of the family’s size are the most effective approaches for poverty alleviation.

TI  - An assessment of the effects of Africa's water crisis on food security and management
PY  - 2014
AB  - Food security remains one of the most pressing concerns of this century. This article explores the often overlooked role of water scarcity in food security. This is particularly important within the African context, because most states on the continent rely heavily on agriculture. The article therefore focuses on Africa, discussing triggers and practices related to water usage currently in place, as well as their impact on development. The authors offer various recommendations on how to improve and streamline policies to encourage efficient water use.

TI  - Benefits and Challenges of Dugout Rainwater Harvesting Ponds in Tigray Region, Ethiopia
PY  - 2017
AB  - In Tigray, over 78,000 dugout ponds have been constructed since 2000. The objective was to alleviate the problem of recurrent drought that prevails in the region every five to ten years. However, it has been reported that most of the ponds are not functional. Therefore, this paper presents an assessment of the dugout pond construction in Tigray with a particular emphasis to challenges and technical problems and pinpoints the causes that led to the poor performance of the ponds. Thus, even though rainwater harvesting ponds have the potential to ensure availability of water for various uses and generate income for smallholders, poor performance levels and insufficient impacts to local communities were widely observed in the study area due to inadequate site selection, absence of biophysical survey during design and construction, leakage and evaporation losses, and poor management of the ponds.

TI  - Effect of Adoption of Irrigation on Rice Yield in the Municipality of Malanville, Benin
PY  - 2017
AB  - The paper employed a Heckman selectivity model to determine factors influencing the adoption of irrigation and its effect on rice yield in Benin. Results from probit estimates indicate that farmer's age, gender, extension services, access to credit, market participation, distance to irrigation scheme, use of tractor and fertilizer are factors affecting the probability of irrigation adoption. Results from Heckman second stage estimates show that the adoption of irrigation contributes significantly to rice yield improvement by 57 per cent. For robustness checks of the estimated effect of adoption of irrigation, the propensity score matching method was used. The results indicate that the percentage increase in rice yield due to irrigation adoption varies between 55 per cent and 60 per cent. This confirms the finding of the Heckman estimates. Other variables explaining rice yield are education, extension services, access to credit, market participation, off farm income, use of tractor, labour, and fertilizer. These results imply that besides the adoption of irrigation the provision of complementary services are needed to achieve the objective of productivity improvement.

TI  - Water at the Centre of Poverty Reduction: Targeting Women as a Stepping Stone in the Nadowli District, Ghana
PY  - 2018
AB  - Poverty reduction has been a challenge in developing countries, pushing many development partners to devise strategies to tackle it. One of such strategies is the provision of water services. Although there has been much focus on water provision, the practice and benefits of integrating multiple-use water services in the design and implementation have been underexplored. This paper argues for the role of multiple-use water services in reducing rural poverty, especially among women. This is based on a case study that was conducted in two communities in the Upper West Region where multipleuse water services have been provided. Data was collected using focus groups discussion mainly with water user associations who are made up of women only, survey of 26 households, and physical observations of the water infrastructure and activities around the infrastructure. We found that access to water services saved time in water collection and contributed to increase household productive hours. Consequently, this resulted in increased output in their economic activities with positive ripple effects on other sectors of the rural economy, leading to poverty reduction as indicated by the participants. It is argued that investing in multiple-use water services is a major way of empowering women to actively engage in multiple streams of income and thus a great potential for achieving the sustainable development goals.

TI  - Does an Improvement in Rural Infrastructure Contribute to Alleviate Poverty in Pakistan? A Spatial Econometric Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - The role of infrastructure in poverty alleviation remains ambiguous due to weak institutions in developing countries. Considering spatial dependence, this study provides empirical evidence on the role of rural infrastructure in poverty alleviation using district-wise data of Pakistan. Results indicate positive direct as well as spatial spillover effects of financial infrastructure and female education infrastructure while positive direct effects of energy infrastructure are observed. The insignificant role of health and transportation infrastructure in poverty alleviation is a matter of serious concern. From a policy point of view, allocation of sufficient financial resources, improvement of female education infrastructure in rural areas and reformulation of health and transportation policies should be priority steps for poverty alleviation. An adverse effect of male education infrastructure on poverty reduction is detected, which needs further exploration. Adverse spillover effects of water and sanitation infrastructure on poverty may suggest the authorities to revise the implementation procedure of National Sanitation and Drinking Water Policy. The analysis might be relevant to the South Asian region due to homogeneous economic development. Moreover, the study provides evidence informing the debate on balanced regional development in developing countries with a particular focus on high and medium level of poverty clusters.

TI  - Impact of Rural Infrastructure on Farm and Non-Farm Enterprise Choice and Income in Bangladesh
PY  - 2014
AB  - Impact of rural infrastructure on economic development is indirect and complex. The present study jointly determines the impact of rural infrastructure on the decision to choose between farm and non-farm enterprises vis-a-vis income by Bangladeshi rural households (4,195 households from 139 villages) using a bivariate Tobit model. The model diagnostic reveals that the decision to choose enterprises is significantly correlated, justifying use of a bivariate approach. Rural infrastructure has a significant but opposite impact on enterprise choices vis-a-vis income. Other major determinants with varying level of influences are farm size, livestock resources, education, farming experience and household assets. However, female-headed households are doubly disadvantaged as they have failed to participate in both enterprises and consequently earned significantly less. Policy implications include investment in rural infrastructure, irrigation, rural electrification, education, livestock resources, tenurial reforms, as well as targeted approach to promote welfare of the female-headed households, e.g., creation of a hired labor market for females.

TI  - Maize Yield and Irrigation Applied in Conservation and Conventional Tillage at Various Plant Densities
PY  - 2019
AB  - Maize is one of the most highly produced crops around the world. Factors such as population density, solar radiation, temperature, availability of nutrients and water, and proper tillage method can have favorable results in increasing yield. This project began in 2015, at two different locations in Georgia (Tifton and Camilla), GA, USA, and has been evaluated for three consecutive maize growing seasons. In each location, a different irrigation method was applied; the University of Georgia (UGA) maize checkbook method was utilized in Tifton and a soil moisture sensor-based method was utilized in Camilla. The different treatments consisted of two tillage methods, conservation and conventional, and four plant densities (69K, 88K, 99K, and 133K plants/ha). The purpose of the project was the evaluation of water requirements by population and tillage method for achieving high maize yields. Soil moisture information was collected hourly in both fields. The results showed that higher plant densities do not necessarily require higher irrigation amounts and do not always have the best results in terms of yield. Conventional tillage had slightly better yield results but not statistically different from conservation tilled plots. Additionally, the results showed that applied irrigation can help in higher maize production. However, increasing the amount of water does not directly equate to higher yield results.

TI  - The Impacts of Undeveloped Roads on the Livelihoods of Rural Women.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Globally poor service delivery is a challenge faced by many rural communities in Third World Countries. The overarching issue of poverty as well as poor services impacts on rural households in Third World Countries. The aim of this study is to assess the impacts of undeveloped roads in the Nyamana community and its direct linkage on the livelihoods of rural women. The Nyamana community is characterised by poor road conditions and is considered an undeveloped area. There is a lack of infrastructural development in the area that places further restrictions on the livelihoods of residents. The use of qualitative and quantitative methods are used in this study. Findings from this study reveal that a direct relationship exist between undeveloped roads and access to many other primary services such as education, employment, healthcare facilities and livelihood strategies. Residents in the Nyamana community have no access to electricity and clean water. In addition infrastructural access is a major difficulty for these residents due to insufficient roads. The study indicates that rural women bear the burden of household chores such as fetching water and collecting fuel wood, which is indicative of the transport burden women carry. Qualitative results of the study reveal that essential services such as healthcare, education and road infrastructure are absent in the community, however no effort is being made by the municipality in improving the provision of services. In addition rural dwellers state isolation and remoteness as a major contributor to their state of poverty, as they are unreachable and non-existent to the rest of society. Additional findings reveal that patriarchy is widespread in the community, which has led to inequalities with regards to access and mobility amongst women.

TI  - Identifying the Links Among Poverty, Hydroenergy and Water Use Using Data Mining Methods
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water is fundamental to human well-being, social development and the environment. Water development, particularly hydropower, provides an important source of renewable energy. Water development is strongly affected by poverty, but only few attempts have been made to understand the links between water development and poverty from a global water development point of view. In this work, this linkage was explored using reservoir construction, hydroenergy and water use data along with six derived indicators. We used association rule mining and classification and regression trees (CART) to identify the links. Random forests were employed to search for factors sensitive to poverty. This study shows that the reservoir density is significantly related to poverty, and reservoir densities are lower in countries with higher poverty rates. Countries with a higher use of small hydropower (SHP) systems are generally more prosperous as follows: an SHP utilization rate above 27% corresponds to a poverty rate below 4.9%. The ratio of water utilization, water availability per capita (WAPC) and reservoir density were essential for the prediction of the poverty class. All three ratios could be related to poverty alleviation as they enable the identification of the potential for water resource development and their constraints. This study concludes that water development in poor countries needs to receive more attention.

TI  - Intensification of Rice Farming: The Role of Mechanization and Irrigation
PY  - 2023
AB  - AbstractPART III of this volume discusses complementary strategies toward the rice Green Revolution in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including mechanization, irrigation, and marketing efforts to enhance demand for domestic rice. In Asia, population pressure on land and high rice prices relative to input prices induced farming intensification, while mechanization and irrigation development boosted rice productivity. However, in SSA, increased rice demand has been partly met by rice imports without adequate investments in these important technologies. This chapter reviews the available evidence on the constraints and potentials of these complementary strategies in SSA. In particular, we argue that inadequate understanding of the complementarity of each strategy with rice cultivation training may be an important reason behind low technology adoption. The remaining chapters in PART III attempt to narrow this gap and provide relevant empirical evidence. Intensive land preparation using tractors facilitates the adoption of management-intensive practices, while the provision of rice cultivation training is associated with the improved economic viability of irrigation investment. Increased demand for domestic rice is also expected to raise the returns to rice cultivation training and technology investment. The adoption of modern milling technologies improves the quality of domestic milled rice and promotes rice value-chain transformation. Local traders offer quality-based pricing that incentivizes farmers to supply high-quality paddy, while urban traders and supermarkets sell domestically produced and milled rice with brand names at a premium. In sum, the use of tractors, irrigation investment, and modern milling, combined with improved rice marketing, play critical roles that complement rice cultivation training in achieving the rice Green Revolution in SSA.

TI  - Community exposure and vulnerability to water quality and availability: a case study in the mining-affected Pazña Municipality, Lake Poopó Basin, Bolivian Altiplano
PY  - 2017
AB  - Assessing water sources for drinking and irrigation along with community vulnerability, especially in developing and rural regions, is important for reducing risk posed by poor water quality and limited water availability and accessibility. We present a case study of rural mining-agricultural communities in the Lake Poopo Basin, one of the poorest regions on the Bolivian Altiplano. Here, relatively low rainfall, high evaporation, salinization and unregulated mining activity have contributed to environmental degradation and water issues, which is a situation facing many Altiplano communities. Social data from 72 households and chemical water quality data from 27 surface water and groundwater sites obtained between August 2013 and July 2014 were used to develop locally relevant vulnerability assessment methodologies and ratings with respect to water availability and quality, and Chemical Water Quality Hazard Ratings to assess water quality status. Levels of natural and mining-related contamination in many waters (CWQHR ≥ 6; 78% of assessed sites) mean that effective remediation would be challenging and require substantial investment. Although waters of fair to good chemical quality (CWQHR ≤ 5; 22% of assessed sites) do exist, treatment may still be required depending on use, and access issues remain problematic. There is a need to comply with water quality legislation, improve and maintain basic water supply and storage infrastructure, build and operate water and wastewater treatment plants, and adequately and safely contain and treat mine waste. This study serves as a framework that could be used elsewhere for assessing and mitigating water contamination and availability affecting vulnerable populations.

TI  - Farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in Benin: a stakeholder-consultation approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractThis article examines rice farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in the municipality of Malanville, Benin. Farmers’ positive perceptions of irrigation include the use of irrigation for insurance against drought, crop yield improvement, higher income, food security and poverty reduction. Analysis of constraints reveals that farmers face major constraints such as lack of agricultural credit, poor access to production inputs, inadequate knowledge of water resources management, poor access to agricultural information and markets, and flooding of fields. Specific constraints in the irrigation scheme of Malanville include the high cost of irrigation and unavailability of water.

TI  - Poverty profiles and nutritional outcomes of using spate irrigation in Ethiopia.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Development partners and public investors assume that spate irrigation reduces household poverty and malnutrition. This article examines whether the poverty profiles of smallholder farmers and the nutritional outcomes of their children have improved as a result of using spate irrigation. The study areas were in two regional states in Ethiopia. Twenty-five users each, both from traditional and modern spate irrigation schemes, and an equal number of non-users responded to a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measures of 122 children under five were measured using a hanging scale and stadiometer. The results indicated that all poverty indices were significantly lower for the spate irrigation users compared to non-users, and were even lower for modern spate compared to traditional spate systems. Our results did not show gender differences, using sex of the household head as a crude measure of gender, in poverty profiles. Stochastic dominance tests showed that the poverty comparisons between users, traditional and modern, and non-users are statistically robust. It can be concluded that the use of spate irrigation can significantly reduce poverty, and modernizing spate systems further increases its poverty-reduction impact. However, anthropometric measures indicated that use of spate irrigation did not have significant nutritional effects, suggesting the need for nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as nutrition education and awareness and multisectoral collaboration.

TI  - A Dual Response of Conservation Agriculture to Climate Change: Reducing CO 2 Emissions and Improving the Soil Carbon Sink
PY  - 2010
AB  - SUMMARY Conservation agriculture (CA), a gradual evolution from notill (NT) of the 1960s and conservation tillage of the 1980s to CA of 2000s, involves 4 subcomponents. These are: (i) NT method of seedbed preparation, (ii) retention of crop residue mulch, (iii) incorporation of a cover crop in the rotation cycle, and (iv) use of integrated nutrient management (INM) to enhance and manage soil fertility. Despite about 60 years of research on NT farming and the related subcomponents of CA, global land area under NT/CA is about 100 million hectares (Mha) on about 7% of the arable land. Further, CA is not being adopted by small-size land holders and the resource-poor farmers of the developing countries. Lack of adoption of CA in developing countries is due to a combination of biophysical, social, economic, and cultural factors. The dual benefits of CA in addressing the climate change are attributed to reduction in emissions because of elimination of plowing and other farm operations, increase in use efficiency of energy-based inputs, and sequestration of soil carbon. Adoption of CA on global cropland has a technical potential of C sequestration of 0.6 – 1.2 Pg/yr. A widespread use of CA, facilitating adaptation to and mitigation of the climate change, can be promoted through payments to farmers for ecosystem services. In addition to mitigating climate change, CA also enhances and sustain agronomic production and advances food security while improving the environment quality.

TI  - The Role of Assets in the Enhancement of Households' Income: A Study of Poverty Alleviation among Rural Communities of Kelantan and Terengganu
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper aims to examine the role of assets and entitlements on the enhancement of farmers’ income. Using a structured socio-economic questionnaire, 302 randomly selected farmers in both Kelantan and Terengganu states were tested. To answer the study’s objectives, one way ANOVA test was carried out and tested. The results indicated that access to land, fertilizers, tractors, and health facilities, quality of housing, market, and livestock have significant positive impact on farmers’ wellbeing. Access to irrigation and having savings (at banks and/or homes) were found to have significant negative impact on farmers’ monthly income. Education and association memberships are not essential factors that might contribute to the enhancement of farmers’ livelihood. Investing in productive assets was found to be more effective rather than safekeeping the money in a bank or at home. However, households and farmers deal with their own assets and entitlement differently. As a result, assets are found to decrease the income of farmers partially due to the farmers’ decision-making strategies which seems to be poor and inadequate. Therefore, incorporating psychological perspective such as farmers’ behaviours and perceptions are utmost important in order to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying the farmers who are falling in poverty trap.

AB  - <jats:p>Farmers’ poverty has long been of global concern, mainly in poor rather than affluent areas. The goal of this paper is to better understand the range of poverty in the context of regional differentiation and to enrich knowledge on farmers’ poverty in affluent areas and areas with good natural conditions. A questionnaire survey of poor farmers in the major grain-producing area of Changchun, Northeast China was conducted. Farmers’ poverty was studied from income poverty and multidimensional poverty by intertwining qualitative and quantitative methods. The results indicate that low education levels and poor physical health were most prevalent in poor farmers, followed by income poverty and low living standards. Governmental policies and the macroeconomic situation in the agricultural sector, non-agricultural employment, aging, cultivated land, and family size correlated closely with farmers’ poverty. The macro changes in policies and global trade liberalization in the agricultural sector impacted farmers’ income through the prices of agricultural products and subsidies and influenced the effect of cultivated land. For poor farmers, the effect of employment opportunities in villages was more significant than in urban areas. Aging remains a challenge for farmers’ poverty now and in the future.</jats:p>

TI  - A re-examination of the impact of irrigation on rice production in Benin: An application of the endogenous switching model
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Irrigation offers important opportunities for enhancing crop yield and production in developing countries. This paper provides a re-examination of the impact of irrigation on rice production in Benin. It employed an endogenous switching model to account for bias due to observable and unobservable factors. The results indicated that the age of the farmer, gender, education, extension services, credit, access to media, ownership of mobile phone, off-farm income, and distance from home to irrigation scheme are factors affecting the probability of the adoption of irrigation. The results also revealed that adoption of irrigation is positively associated with rice productivity improvement. Farm variables such as soil fertility, labor, and fertilizer and herbicide application have a positive effect on rice productivity. Other variables increasing the rice yield were: education, credit, off-farm income, and access to media. These findings suggest that investments in irrigation should be accompanied by the provision of institutional support measures and complementary farm inputs to enhance the impact of irrigation on rice production.

TI  - Freshwater Scarcity
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p> The availability and use of fresh water are critical for human health and for economic and ecosystem stability. But the growing mismatch between human demands and natural freshwater availability is contributing to water scarcity, affecting industrial and agricultural production and a wide range of social, economic, and political problems, including poverty, deterioration of ecosystem health, and violent conflicts. Understanding and addressing different forms of water scarcity are vital for moving toward more sustainable management and use of fresh water. We provide here a review of concepts and definitions of water scarcity, metrics and indicators used to evaluate scarcity together with strategies for addressing and reducing the adverse consequences of water scarcity, including the development of alternative sources of water, improvements in water-use efficiency, and changes in systems of water management and planning. </jats:p>

TI  - Water, agriculture and poverty in the Niger River basin
PY  - 2010
AB  - Livelihoods in the Niger River basin rely mainly on rainfed agriculture, except in the dry extreme north. Low yields and water productivity result from low inputs, short growing seasons, dry spells, and excessive water. The overlap of traditional and modern rules impedes secure access to water and investments in agriculture by generating uncertain land tenure. Improved agriculture and water management require technical, sociological, and regulatory changes to address the wider causes of poverty. Illiteracy and poor water quality, both correlated with high infant mortality, are pressing problems. Rapidly increasing population, climatic changes and dam construction contribute to rural vulnerability.

TI  - Reducing rural poverty through multiple-use water services: the women's perspective in north-western Ghana
PY  - 2015
AB  - Globally, poverty reduction has remained prominent in the development agenda of donors, governments and civil society organisations. Various strategies have been employed by these stakeholders to reduce poverty especially in rural areas of the developing world. Historically, although water provision has received much attention, integrating multiple-use water systems in the design and implementation was less emphasised. This paper presents findings on a case study that was conducted in three communities in north-western Ghana where multiple water use systems have been provided with the aim of alleviating poverty, especially among women. The main methods used in gathering data include focus group discussion, household survey and interviews. The study established that the provision of water facilities has had several social benefits. In terms of economic activities, the women have been empowered to actively engage in multiple income streams. Despite the benefits from the water facilities, marginalisation of women as regard the facility in one of the communities poses a threat to the sustainability and poverty reduction efforts. This can be overcome with the intervention of the District Assembly who has oversight responsibility over development interventions in the area.

TI  - Structured analysis of seepage losses in irrigation supply channels for cost-effective investments: case studies from the southern Murray-Darling Basin of Australia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Much of inland Australia has been in perpetual drought since 1997 except during 2010 when above average rainfall occurred. It has been the worst drought since 1788 when European settlement began. Water scarcity poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture in major irrigation systems across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). There is a need for water-saving measures and a structured approach to assess water loss in earthen supply channels. This paper presents such an approach to assess and reduce seepage losses for improving irrigation efficiencies. Main elements of this approach are the following: field measurements, hydrologic modelling, potential options for seepage reduction, economic analysis and financing water-saving investments. Using data from two irrigation systems in the southern MDB, a case is made for reducing seepage water losses in irrigation supply channels in a cost-effective manner using low-cost technologies. Increasing the level of security for investments in water-saving programs provides incentives to key stakeholders to achieve water-saving targets. Considering the value of water recovered from reducing seepage loss at irrigation system level, this study demonstrates how reducing just one component (seepage) from the total water losses in irrigation systems can help improve water supplies as well as the environmental flows. Potential options for financing infrastructure improvement for saving irrigation water are proposed and discussed.

TI  - A compact to revitalise large-scale irrigation systems using a leadership-partnership-ownership ‘theory of change’
PY  - 2016
AB  - In countries with transitional economies such as those found in South Asia, large-scale irrigation systems (LSIS) with a history of public ownership account for about 115 million ha (Mha) or approximately 45% of their total area under irrigation. In terms of the global area of irrigation (320 Mha) for all countries, LSIS are estimated at 130 Mha or 40% of irrigated land. These systems can potentially deliver significant local, regional and global benefits in terms of food, water and energy security, employment, economic growth and ecosystem services. For example, primary crop production is conservatively valued at about US$355 billion. However, efforts to enhance these benefits and reform the sector have been costly and outcomes have been underwhelming and short-lived. We propose the application of a 'theory of change' (ToC) as a foundation for promoting transformational change in large-scale irrigation centred upon a 'global irrigation compact' that promotes new forms of leadership, partnership and ownership (LPO). The compact argues that LSIS can change by switching away from the current channelling of aid finances controlled by government irrigation agencies. Instead it is for irrigators, closely partnered by private, public and NGO advisory and regulatory services, to develop strong leadership models and to find new compensatory partnerships with cities and other river basin neighbours. The paper summarises key assumptions for change in the LSIS sector including the need to initially test this change via a handful of volunteer systems. Our other key purpose is to demonstrate a ToC template by which large-scale irrigation policy can be better elaborated and discussed.

TI  - What Contributes to Disparity in Rural-Urban Poverty in Tamil Nadu?: A District Level Analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Eradicating world hunger and extreme poverty has been a high profile issue on the global development agenda. Yet the distribution of rural-urban poverty and the extent of its disparity remain unknown. To-date poverty has been regarded largely as a rural issue. The poverty rates are higher in the rural areas in almost all developing countries, and in aggregate terms most people still live in rural areas (World Bank, 2008). However, due to globalisation the population of even developing countries is urbanizing fast (UNDP, 2006). Would the locus of poverty move from rural to urban poverty? Would the urban share of poverty grow over time? Should future poverty reduction strategies also target urban areas? Haddad et al., (1999) compiled rural and urban poverty measures for eight countries and found that for seven of them the urban share of the total number of poor increased over time. The poor urbanise faster and this is found to be consistent with cross-sectional data for 39 countries and time series data for India covering various survey rounds spanning 1974 to 1997-98 (Ravallion, 2002). New economic opportunities in the urban areas attract rural migrants, such that urban areas act as magnets that attract poverty. To other observers, urbanisation has been seen as a new source of poverty. Although poverty in developing countries remains predominantly rural, data are lacking on the extent to which absolute poverty in the world is a rural or urban phenomenon (Ravallion et al., 2007). In this paper, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the extent of disparity in rural and urban poverty for India, with emphasis on Tamil Nadu State. The level of aggregation in most studies has been the national or Indian economy as a whole, leaving little scope for analysing the import of widening regional disparity in rural-urban poverty in India. Intra-regional disparities at the district level are hardly explicit in macro level data for the state as a whole. In particular the studies covering district-wise (sub-state level) data especially on Tamil Nadu State are almost none. The analysis on poverty using aggregate state level data may not reveal the true extent of disparity in poverty as the agro-climatic and other controlling

TI  - IDENTIFYING STRESS PRONE VILLAGES USING TIME SERIES SATELLITE IMAGERY: A CASE STUDY ON ODISHA
PY  - 2012
AB  - The main objective of this study is to map rice areas in Odisha from 2000-01 to 2010-11 using MODIS 250-m 8-day time-series data with spectral matching techniques and identify stress-prone rice areas in the state. The information generated can potentially guide rice scientists and planners in developing technologies suited to rainfed conditions and other rice ecosystems as well as in targeting technologies adapted to local needs. Moreover, the information could be used to develop stress-adaptive measures and technologies focusing on the most vulnerable areas where drought is most severe and where rainfed rice production is the major livelihood of farmers. This study demonstrates the usefulness of MODIS time series data in monitoring rice areas including cropping pattern and cropping intensities across stress prone areas. This study also demonstrates how remote sensing can identify areas that are prone to repeated droughts and which would be key target areas for the promotion of drought tolerant rice varieties to ensure sustainable rice production, improve food security and livelihoods.

TI  - Similarity analysis for the Blue Nile Basin in the Ethiopian Highlands
PY  - 2012
AB  - Up until today, rainwater management practices have been promoted regardless of site-specific biophysical characteristics and regardless of the socio-economic and institutional environment. Therefore, low adoption rates and high disadoption rates of rainwater management practices are observed. In order to promote rainwater management more successfully, a paradigm change towards promotion of location-specific interventions is needed. Beyond biophysical suitability, successful implementation crucially depends on farmers’ willingness to adopt a practice. Therefore, the socio-economic and institutional environment must be taken into account in a spatially explicit way. A first step towards the promotion of site-specific rainwater management requires an understanding of which sites present similar biophysical, socio-economic and institutional characteristics within a basin. The objective of this report is twofold. Firstly, it aims at presenting the available spatial data for the Blue Nile Basin in the Ethiopian highlands. Secondly, it develops a methodology that allows identifying locations within a landscape that have similar biophysical, infrastructure, socio-economics, and governance characteristics relevant to rainwater management. The authors would like to thank Nancy Johnson and Tilahun Amede for their constructive comments. This research has been funded by the Challenge Program for Water and Food (CPWF). 2 Similarity analysis for the Blue Nile Basin in the Ethiopian highlands

TI  - Gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst smallholder Ethiopian women farmers
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Although Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can offer economic and food security opportunities for women farmers, success in the uptake of these technologies is contested by gendered constraints. Previous studies that use the household head as a unit of analysis to explain adoption patterns do not adequately demonstrate the extent to which women smallholders are restricted by gendered constraints. This study uses 344 women and men survey respondents involved in conservation agriculture (CA) and small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) as data sources for examining the effect of gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst women in three areas in Ethiopia. Qualitative and quantitative data collections were applied using survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test and binary logistic regression using statistical software for the social sciences (SPSS) version 24. Thematic and narrative analysis methods were used to analyze qualitative data. The findings show that women smallholders uptake is affected by limited access to credit, extension, restricted membership in cooperatives and water user associations, lack of access or user rights to land, skill training, information, and restricted mobility. Agricultural development interventions should be implemented by accepting and considering individual farmer's entitlement to development. Expanding off-farm diversification and rural employment opportunities through changing the land tenure system, which is currently state-owned, are essential to enhance women smallholders’ access to land and other agricultural inputs.

TI  - Circumscribing the Nexus between Natural Disaster, Water Resources and Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2015
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is prone to a wide variety of natural disasters. The occurrence of phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires leave behind huge losses of life and property. With an estimated population of 880 million in 2005, SSA fast growing population rate of 2–4% per annum, the number of people exposed to disasters will continue to rise. Given the fact that there is a nexus between water resources, poverty and natural disaster occurrence, it is but paramount that studies should be carried in this domain. Unfortunately, many studies tally on the pressures exerted by anthropogenic activities on water resources, but pay less attention to the link between disaster occurrence water resources and poverty, especially in SSA. Again, SSA lags behind in terms of scientific knowhow to predict and provide solutions as regards disaster management in many ways. Moreover, there is a general laxity on the part of policy-makers to invest in science and innovations coupled with relatively weak infrastructure that characterize the few scientific institutions. Knowing that water resources are essential to both humanity and the environment and that the occurrence of natural disasters might reduce the economic importance of water resource, it is imperative to shed light in this area. This article, therefore, raises awareness and examines the links between natural disasters, water resources and poverty in SSA.

TI  - Rainwater harvesting for dryland agriculture in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Ethiopian drylands occupy about 65% of the total land mass (close to 700,000km2) of the country. The predominantly rainfed agriculture in these drylands is highly constrained due to erratic rainfall, long dry-spells and excessive loss of rainwater through non-productive pathways (surface runoff, evaporation and deep drainage). Apart from this, deteriorated dryland soils have low infiltration and water holding capacity, shallow depths and are sensitive to crusting. Therefore, to keep in pace with the demand for food for the burgeoning population, the Ethiopian drylands should be made more productive through appropriate rainwater harvesting and management techniques. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop appropriate rainwater harvesting and management techniques in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) drylands of Ethiopia through a participatory planning and development process. Primarily, an overview of the various rainwater harvesting and management techniques in sub-Saharan Africa was made. Moreover, the biophysical performances and socioeconomic implications of the most common practices were synthesized. The sub-Saharan Africa is actually the birthplace of a range of indigenous rainwater harvesting and management (RWHM) techniques. The micro-catchment and in situ RWHM techniques are more commonly applied than the macro-catchment techniques for supplemental irrigation on farm lands. Depending on rainfall patterns and local soil characteristics, appropriate application of in-situ and micro-catchment techniques could improve the soil water content of the rooting zone by up to 30%. Smart combinations of rainwater harvesting and soil improvements enable to increase crop yields by 200-600% as compared to the traditional farming without them. Following the implementation of rainwater harvesting techniques, the cereal-based smallholder farmers could shift to diversified crops, hence improving household food security, dietary status, and economic return. The interplay between drought vulnerability and the changing trends in land-use/cover and land management in the CRV drylands of Ethiopia was made using a combination of GIS/remote sensing, meteorological drought analyses and surveying techniques. Given late onset of rainfall seasons (for both livestock farming and crop cultivation) and long dry-spells (for crop cultivation only) as the perceived causes of drought, pastoral system was vulnerable to severe drought once in seven years while mixed crop-livestock farming was vulnerable to severe drought once in twenty eight years. Over the last 5 decades, cultivated lands increased to threefold while the dense acacia coverage declined from 42% in 1965 to 9% in 2010. Although conversion from pastoral life to mixed crop-livestock system was perceived important to cope with drought, long-term tillage using the traditional Maresha cultivation caused deteriorates of the soil water properties. Infiltration rate of the surface soil layer increases significantly immediately after conversion of acacia-based grasslands to cultivation. However, there is a weak decreasing trend in infiltration rate and a significant increase in soil evaporation with increases in cultivation durations. Thus, it was implied that improved soil management and appropriate tillage are needed to maximize rainwater use efficiency and achieve sustainable agricultural production in the CRV of Ethiopia. Two-year field experimentation was undertaken to calibrate and examine the role of the FAO’s AquaCrop model in simulating the effect of rainwater harvesting techniques in response to different rainfall patterns and soil fertility levels in the CRV of Ethiopia. After proper calibration of the FAO’s AquaCrop model, it was possible to simulate the effect of tied-ridges and soil fertility improvements on maize yield and water use efficiency in response to different rainfall patterns. The model simulation revealed that the effect of tied-ridges alone performed better than soil fertility improvements during below-average rainfall seasons. During above-average rainfall seasons, the combined use of tied-ridges and soil fertility improvement was found very effective to substantially improve maize yield. This is because the excess water held in the tied-ridges can be best utilized due to the enhanced water uptake capacity of maize growing in the fertilized soils. Depending on the seasonal rainfall patterns, the combined use of tied-ridges and optimum level of soil fertilizer doubles the rainwater use efficiency of maize. A field experiment during a normal rainfall in 2010 revealed that the combined use of farmyard manure (4.5 Mg ha-1) and tied-ridges increased maize yield by 47% while tied-ridges in isolation increased maize yield by 26%. Moreover, long-term simulation revealed that the effect of tied-ridges on yield improvements was higher for sowing in April than for sowing in May. Finally, this study enabled to develop a participatory planning approach for rainwater harvesting and management. The approach starts with investigation of the priority agro-meteorological determinants for crop production and identification of the existing knowledge and opportunities. The proposed approach also enables to plan an integrated rainwater harvesting and soil improvement techniques. The application of this new approach in the CRV implied that any effort on the introduction of new in situ rainwater harvesting techniques should assess existing tillage, hoeing and associated land management practices. The existing Dirdaro furrow system could be taken as a basis to introduce and develop tied-ridges using the Maresha-modified ridger. Overall, this approach may augment the recent efforts of dissemination of rainwater harvesting and management techniques for improved agricultural development in the vast drylands of Ethiopia.

PY  - 2011
AB  - La investigacion tuvo por objetivo evaluar el impacto del conocimiento tecnologico, obtenido mediante Escuelas de campo, sobre la disponibilidad alimentaria de campesinos indigenas pobres dedicados principalmente a la produccion de maiz para autoconsumo en la region Cuicateca de Oaxaca, Mexico. Las variables analizadas fueron: 1) Nivel de conocimiento tecnologico; 2) Rendimientos de Maiz y 3) Tiempo en que la ultima cosecha, de maiz, abastece las necesidades alimenticias de los campesinos referidos (un indicador proxi de disponibilidad alimentaria). A una muestra aleatoria de 36 participantes en Escuelas de campo y un grupo testigo de igual tamano se aplicaron cuestionarios al inicio y final del estudio. El analisis estadistico se realizo con las pruebas de contraste x 2 de Pearson asi como la de Kolmogorov-Smirnov y en virtud de no haberse comprobado una distribucion normal, se aplico la prueba de Wilcoxon para contrastar datos pareados, y finalmente se obtuvieron correlaciones. Se encontro que el aumento en el Nivel de conocimiento tecnologico de 7.29±1.01 a 46.64±18.40 no presenta correlacion (P>0.05) con el tiempo en que la ultima cosecha, de maiz, abastece las necesidades alimenticias. Los resultados muestran que el incremento en el nivel de conocimiento tecnologico no aumenta la disponibilidad alimentaria de maiz

TI  - Economics of selected water control technologies and their successful use: The case of Ethiopia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Using a production function, marginal productivity of farm inputs and benefit-cost analysis, we explore the economics of selected water control technologies. From the production function, all farm inputs, including irrigation water is found to have a significant and positive effect on yield. Marginal value products of farm inputs are found to be positive but their magnitudes differ by type of control structures, crop type, agro-ecology and regions. The net present values of all water control structures are positive. There is a favorable precondition for sustainable adoption of these controls technologies and institutionalizing some sort of cost recovery schemes. The level of education, the ratio of irrigated land allocated to irrigated annuals and perennials, access to markets and off-farm income are found to have significant effect on successful use of these control structures. Recommendations and policy implications are drawn accordingly. Key word: water control, NPV, production function, instrumental variables regression; Africa.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Trend Analysis of Temperature and Rainfall over Ziway Lake Basin, Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Rainfall and temperature trends detection is vital for water resources management and decision support systems in agro-hydrology. This study assessed the historical (1983–2005) and future (2026–2100) rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin) trends of the Ziway Lake Basin (Ethiopia). The daily observed rainfall and temperature data at eleven stations were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia, while simulated historical and future climate data were obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) datasets under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of 4.5 and 8.5. The CMIP5 datasets were statistically downscaled by using the climate model data for hydrologic modeling (CMhyd) tool and bias corrected using the distribution mapping method available in the CMhyd tool. The performance of simulated rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin of the CMIP5 models were statistically evaluated using observation datasets at eleven stations. The results showed that the selected CMIP5 models can reasonably simulate the monthly rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin at the majority of the stations. Modified Mann–Kendall trend test were applied to estimate the trends of annual rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin in the historical and future periods. We found that rainfall experienced no clear trends, while Tmax, and Tmin showed consistently significant increasing trends under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. However, the warming is expected to be greater under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5 by the end of the 21st century, resulting in an increasing trend of Tmax and Tmin at all stations. The greatest warming occurred in the central part of the basin, with statistically significant increases largely seen by the end of the 21st century, which is expected to exacerbate the evapotranspiration demand of the area that could negatively affect the freshwater availability within the basin. This study increases our understanding of historic trends and projected future change effects on rainfall- and evapotranspiration-related climate variables, which can be used to inform adaptive water resource management strategies.</jats:p>

TI  - Citizen Science and the Sustainable Development Goals: Building Social and Technical Capacity through Data Collection in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Engaging youth and women in data-scarce, least developed countries (LDCs) is gaining attention in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) arena, as is using citizen science as a multi-faceted mechanism for data collection, engendering personal empowerment and agency. Involving these populations in citizen science is a powerful synergy that simultaneously addresses the Leave-No-One-Behind promise in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda, yet most citizen science takes place in the Global North, and attention to LDCs is needed. This article highlights a four-year, four-location, hydrology-focused, interdisciplinary citizen science initiative (CSI) in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Through a systematic evaluation, we explore scientific applications of the hydrologic data, as well as the social dimensions in the CSI, towards building a social and technical capacity that supports the SDGs at the local and international scale. In the CSI, Ethiopian high school students received training from local university faculty and graduate students, collecting river stage and groundwater level measurements, and farmers conducted soil resistivity measurements using a novel sensor technology developed for the study area. We found the datasets to be ample for use to locally validate regional groundwater models and seasonal forecasts on soil moisture and streamflow. We conducted written interviews with the students, which revealed their ability to perceive benefits of engagement in the CSI, as well as recognize their increased individual technical capacity. An analysis of the hydrological data demonstrates the readiness of the datasets to be used for evaluating water-related interventions that facilitate the SDGs, broadly, by building synergies between individuals and institutions. As such, we map how both the hydrologic data and experiences of the citizen scientists support the SDGs at the Goal and Target-level, while forging new social and technical pathways.</jats:p>

TI  - Farmers' Perceptions about Irrigation Roles in Climate Change Adaptation and Determinants of the Choices to WUE-Improving Practices in Southern Ethiopia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> Irrigation enhances resilience to the negative impacts of climate change through sustainable food production and environmental health. However, water is a scarce resource that needs efficient utilization. This study explored (1) farmers’ perceptions about the roles of irrigation in climate change adaptation and (2) determinants of the choices to selected WUE-improving soil and water management practices in southern Ethiopia. A multistage sampling technique was used to survey 373 households. The results indicated that the majority of surveyed households were male-headed: 90.6%, above 40 years old: 56.8%, and uneducated: 73.5%. They perceived that irrigation improved their net income (INCOM): 88%, acted as insurance against decreased rainfall (IADR): 44.8%, and insurance against increased temperature (IAIT): 70%; though the water was not available in all dry seasons: 55%. The choice to tightly close water-diversion points after use is significantly positively ( p &lt; .05) affected by education level (EDUC) and perceptions about irrigation water as IADR and IAIT. However, the farmers’ perceptions about INCOM significantly negatively affected their choice to not irrigate at peak sunshine hours. The choice of mulching is significantly positively affected by the perception of INCOM and IAIT. Similarly, the choice of using compost is significantly positively affected by EDUC and their perceptions of IADR and IAIT, and significantly negatively affected by INCOM. The choice of not practicing conventional tillage is strongly negatively affected by the farmers’ perceptions about equitable water distribution (EWD) and INCOM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the farmers’ understanding of the roles of irrigation in climate change adaptation is good but their understanding of WUE-improving practices is poor due to poor water distribution systems and low education levels. So, improving water distribution systems and farmers’ awareness about WUE-improving practices are suggested to the study area and other countries under related conditions. </jats:p>

TI  - A framework for defining equity and sustainability in the Nile River Basin
PY  - 2012
AB  - The objectives of this research were to objectively define the two important terms, ‘equity’ and ‘without appreciable harm’, in the water utilization principles enshrined in the United Nation (UN) Convention in the context of visions of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). Need-based allocation of Nile waters and the new emerging concept of ‘reserved’ and ‘shared’ water were used as tools to quantify equity. Results of allocation based on per capita per year indicated that Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt and Equatorial states, each, will get 15, 22, 49, and 14% of the annual flow of Nile waters, respectively. Evaluation of allocation scenarios of the Nile waters revealed that allocation based on the 1959 Water Agreement does not guarantee sustainable utilization and does not comply with the UN Convention. However, allocation based on the weighted area and per capita methods were found to guarantee sustainable utilization and to comply with the UN Convention. The results of this study can be used as a framework of negotiation platform to open up more fruitful discussions and dialogues among decision makers in the basin states.

TI  - The Economics of Irrigation Water: Empirical Evidence from the Awash River Basin, Ethiopia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> Using primary data collected from Ethiopia’s Awash River basin, we study the economics of irrigation water for smallholder farmers. We estimate the impact of irrigation water on gross margin and chemical fertilizer uptake. Our results show that irrigation water has a statistically significant and positive effect on the profitability of crops and chemical fertilizer uptake. We also generate qualitative data on irrigation water returns by producing various crops in the different parts of the basin. In addition, we present the intensity of irrigation water used for various crops in the different parts of the basin as reported by farmers. In doing so, we offer some qualitative evidence on the economic trade-offs involved in irrigation water use at farm and basin levels. The policy implications of the findings are discussed. </jats:p>

TI  - Diversion of flashy floods for agricultural use and its effect on nutrition in Ethiopia
PY  - 2014
AB  - The study examined whether access to spate irrigation leads to better nutrition outcomes. The results showed that there is an overall improvement in the study sites compared to the 2011 DHS study. As far as households with access to spate irrigation are concerned, weight-for-height z-scores indicated that 8.2% of the children had prevalence of global acute malnutrition; 8.2% of them had moderate acute malnutrition. None of the children had severe acute malnutrition. The weight-for-age results indicated that 27.5, 17.6 and 9.8% of the children showed prevalence of underweight, moderate underweight and severe underweight, respectively. The height-for-age z-scores showed 56.5, 30.8 and 21.7% of the children had prevalence of stunting, moderate stunting and severe stunting, respectively. On the other hand, households without access to spate irrigation indicated that as far as the weight-for-height z-scores of children are concerned, there were no children (boys and girls) with prevalence of global acute malnutrition; weight for-age z-score showed that 13.6, 10.2 and 3.4% of the children had prevalence of underweight, moderate underweight and severe underweight, respectively. The height-for-age z-scores showed that 45.5, 25.5 and 20.0% of the children had prevalence of stunting, moderate stunting and severe stunting, respectively. The anthropometric measures, thus, showed the nutritional outcomes of users were worse-off than of nonusers of spate irrigation. This happens in the face of better income and consumption expenditures, mainly nonfood, for users compared to nonusers. This underlines the importance of nutrition education alongside efforts to improve access to irrigation. Moreover, multisectoral collaborations are needed between the health, agriculture, water, social protection, education, gender and other sectors to improve the nutrition outcome of children.
