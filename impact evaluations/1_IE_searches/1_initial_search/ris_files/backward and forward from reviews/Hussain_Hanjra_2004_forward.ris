TI  - Food Security in the Riverine Rural Communities of the Lower Mekong Basin, Cambodia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Food security is a major issue in the struggle to attain sustainable development and poverty reduction in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). In this article, we aim to determine food security situation in the rural riverine communities of the LMB, Cambodia. The degree and frequency of – and local responses to – food shortages and past, current and future trends in employment opportunities are analysed. In our detailed study of the Upper, Middle and Lower stretches along the LMB, we found that: (1) food insecurity exists in all three areas and has been mostly concentrated among the poor over the last decade; (2) there is a close association between food shortages and poverty, but no relationship between food shortages and its consequences; (3) local responses to food insecurity have proven ineffective leaving the villagers to deal with it by simply reducing their food consumption; and, (4) the existing local employment could not ensure food security and sustainable livelihoods of the villagers. The findings sug...

TI  - Impact of irrigation practices on Gilgel Abay, Ribb and Gumara fisheries, Tana Sub-Basin, Ethiopia.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract In Ethiopia, particularly in Tana Sub-Basin, irrigation development practice is increasing. However, this development ignored the fisheries; no, enough information about its effects. The sub-basin is rich in fisheries, including the 17 Labeobarbus species (the only remaining cyprinid species in the world). The fishery is also supporting over 6000 fishers. Hence, this study investigated the impact of irrigation practices on the Gilgel Abay, Ribb, and Gumara fisheries. Methods include fish sampling below and above the weirs, expert interviews, key informant interviews, secondary data, and impact significance matrix methods. The data collection time was from July 2019 to June 2020. The analysis of the data was qualitative and quantitative. The existing irrigation system affects fisheries by blocking upstream spawning migration routes (Gilgel Abay Weir and Ribb Dam, for sure catch below the Gilgel Abay Weir, significantly higher than above the weir, Shannon Index (H’), P

TI  - Key and Smart Actions to Alleviate Hunger and Poverty Through Irrigation and Drainage
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the pursuit of information to support the policies and actions to alleviate hunger and poverty from a perspective of the role and impacts of irrigation and drainage, this paper attempts to provide correlation between water scarcity, community and poverty. Many reviews have found strong direct and indirect relationships between irrigation and poverty. One of the main goals of the international community is to eliminate hunger and poverty and in this perspective, through the Millennium Development Goals much progress has been achieved and evidence obtained. Sustainable Development Goals and various United Nations and other initiatives, intend to move forward this agenda by making it a part of the broader development frameworks. In this paper, the important elements of the irrigation and drainage that affect the alleviation of hunger and poverty have been discussed. These elements are grouped into governance, rights-based developments, water rights and pricing, management, efficiency improvement, and role of technology. Both the potential and the need to make use of innovative technology and solutions in irrigation are underlined and these can be used to cater the challenges in different sub-sectors. The main focus of these solutions are on maximizing productivity and efficiency, reducing water losses, achieving sustainable intensification and managing demands on water resources and the associated trade-offs.

TI  - How Profitable is Cultivation of Rainfed Crops? Some Insights from Cost of Cultivation Studies
PY  - 2014
AB  - It is believed that the irrigated crops generate more profit than that of the same crops cultivated under rainfed or less-irrigated condition. How far does this perception hold true at a time when the farmers across regions have been groaning of rising cost of cultivation and inadequate profit from crop cultivation? Using the cost of cultivation data published by the CACP for the period 1971–72 to 2010–11, this paper has studied the economics of five important crops, namely bajra, maize, gram, groundnut and cotton, grown under two distinct conditions, viz. irrigated and rainfed/less-irrigated, in different states of India. The study has shown that there is no marked difference in the profitability (at constant prices) of cereal crops (bajra and maize) cultivated under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Unlike cereal crops, gram has unbelievably turned out to be a profitable crop to the farmers in both the irrigated and rainfed conditions. In the case of groundnut crop, the rainfed state of Gujarat has outshined the irrigated Tamil Nadu state where farmers have suffered losses more number of times as compared to their counterparts in Gujarat during the study period. The cotton crop has proved to be a massively loss-making crop under rainfed condition, but quite profitable under irrigated condition. The study has also revealed that due to fast increase in the cost of cultivation, the profitability of the crops has been severely hit mostly during the agrarian crisis period (1995–96 to 2010–11).

TI  - Water security and rural household food security: empirical evidence from the Mzinyathi district in South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper aimed to investigate the determinants of water security in an irrigation scheme, and how this water security level subsequently affects the farmer’s household food security level. Water security refers to access by the irrigating households to sufficient and reliable water to meet the agricultural needs and their ability to assert the water rights against other parties. A random sample of 185 irrigating households was interviewed in Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme in Mzinyathi District, South Africa. Data were analysed using principal component analysis and ordinary least squares. The empirical results indicated that factors such as farmer’s age, off-farm income, farmer association membership, use of pumps, location on the upper-end of the canal and training increase household water security. Conversely, factors such as occurrence of conflicts and location at the tail-end of the canal were found to decrease household water security. This study highlights the importance of strengthening farmer organisational capacity and local institutions for enhancing the water security status of farmers in smallholder irrigation schemes. The results also indicated that perceived water security has a positive impact on household food consumption per adult equivalent. Therefore, for better impact on household food security, the study recommends that priority should be placed in ensuring household water security, not just investing in the physical irrigation scheme and irrigation participation. The human and social dimensions need to receive priority. Training farmers in collective water governance and water conservation techniques to improve water-use efficiency as well as introducing motorised pumps would take irrigators a long way in enhancing their water security.

TI  - Water productivity of vegetables under modern irrigation methods in oman
PY  - 2012
AB  - Improving water productivity can make a sterling contribution to global food production and poverty alleviation. Groundwater has always been a critical resource for agriculture. Scientific understanding of water productivity can help address water scarcity concerns through more productive use of scarce water resources and higher socio-economic benefits from available water. This study examined the water productivity in the Al Batinah region of Oman using farm-level data. In total 124 crops grown during the 4 years 2005–2008 were examined. Field studies were carried out for 4 years (2005–2008) on 18 field plots to examine yield, inputs, irrigation, costs and economic return of sweet melon, sweet pepper, cabbage and tomatoes grown under drip irrigation vs Rhodes grass grown under sprinkler irrigation using groundwater. The aim was to identify suitable combinations of vegetable crops grown under drip irrigation that can maximize the profitability of the farmers by optimizing water productivity. Results from the 4-year data show that tomato and cabbage performed better than sweet pepper or melon as far as water productivity was concerned, while the drip irrigation method had shown better performance than sprinkler irrigation. Average crop water productivity was estimated at 7.8 and 11.9 kg m‾3 for the cabbage and tomato crops, respectively. The cabbage crop also gave the highest gross return of RO105 for each riyal Omani (RO 1.00 = US$2.59 in June, 2005) of investment in irrigation water. It has also been analysed that the drip irrigation system performed better in terms of crop water productivity and economic water productivity per cubic metre of water applied. So the research results represent decision-making options of vegetable growers at farm scale but also offer important insights for the adoption of the drip irrigation system as well as the design of water policy incentives for irrigation modernization in Oman and other water-scarce regions.

TI  - Evaluating irrigation investments in Malawi: economy-wide impacts under uncertainty and labor constraints
PY  - 2018
AB  - Irrigation expansion is critical to increase crop yields and mitigate effects from climate change in Subâ€ Saharan Africa, but the low profitability has led to little irrigation investments in the region so far. Using an integrated modeling framework, we simultaneously evaluate the returns to irrigation arising from both economic and biophysical impact channels to understand what determines the profitability of irrigation in Malawi. Our results confirm that the returns to irrigation cannot cover the costs in Malawi. While laborâ€ intensive irrigation expansion leads to unfavorable structural change in the shortâ€ run, the profitability hinges on low irrigated yields that fall far from expectations due to insufficient input use and crop management techniques. On the other hand, we find that the nonmonetary benefits of irrigation regarding higher food security, lower poverty, and reduced vulnerability to climate change make investments in irrigation worthwhile to improve the livelihoods of smallholders.

TI  - Performance of irrigation projects and their impacts on poverty reduction and its empowerment in arid environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of pre and post dam construction were assessed in one of the arid regions of Iran commanded by Minab dam. The methodology used in this study was drawn from the international organizations especially the World Commission on Dams and the United Nations for selection of the indicators for sustainable development relating to water resources projects. Commissioning of the dam in 1986 led to progressive expansion of the irrigated agriculture, which was almost doubled in year 2006. Results of the study revealed that there is significant positive impact of the irrigation infrastructures of the dam; for example literacy rate has increased from 41 % (pre project) to 74 % in 2006. Similarly, significant improvements were observed in health care, sanitation, education and other scopes. Nevertheless, for some of the targets only 50-60 % progress were made, whereas no significant achievements had been made in the others. Therefore, development did not match with the planned goals of the project. Deficiency in achieving the primary objectives, especially after many years of project completion, may be attributed to the management and implementation of the project. For effective project performance, a new institutional framework and guide lines are proposed in this article.

TI  - A Holistic View of Global Croplands and Their Water Use for Ensuring Global Food Security in the 21st Century through Advanced Remote Sensing and Non-remote Sensing Approaches
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper presents an exhaustive review of global croplands and their water use, for the end of last millennium, mapped using remote sensing and non-remote sensing approaches by world’s leading researchers on the subject. A comparison at country scale of global cropland area estimated by these studies had a high R2-value of 0.89–0.94. The global cropland area estimates amongst different studies are quite close and range between 1.47–1.53 billion hectares. However, significant uncertainties exist in determining irrigated areas which, globally, consume nearly 80% of all human water use. The estimates show that the total water use by global croplands varies between 6,685 to 7,500 km3 yr−1 and of this around 4,586 km3 yr−1 is by rainfed croplands (green water use) and the rest by irrigated croplands (blue water use). Irrigated areas use about 2,099 km3 yr−1 (1,180 km3 yr−1 of blue water and the rest from rain that falls over irrigated croplands). However, 1.6 to 2.5 times the blue water required by irrigated croplands is actually withdrawn from reservoirs or pumping of ground water, suggesting an irrigation efficiency of only between 40–62 percent. The weaknesses, trends, and future directions to precisely estimate the global croplands are examined. Finally, the paper links global croplands and their water use to a paradigm for ensuring future food security.

TI  - Groundwater irrigation reduces overall poverty but increases socioeconomic vulnerability in a semiarid region of southern India.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The development of irrigation is generally considered an efficient way to reduce poverty in rural areas, although its impact on the inequality between farmers is more debated. In fact, assessing the impact of water management on different categories of farmers requires resituating it within the different dimensions of the local socio-technical context. We tested this hypothesis in a semi-arid area in Karnataka, South India, where groundwater irrigation was introduced five decades ago. Using the conceptual framework of comparative agriculture, based on farmers' interviews, we built a farm typology, traced the trajectories of farm types over the last decades and assessed their current technical and economic performances. Our results show that the differentiation of farm trajectories since the 1950s has been linked with the development of groundwater irrigation, interplaying with their initial assets, and the evolution of the national and local contexts. We highlight the mechanisms by which irrigation indeed reduces poverty but engenders fragilities, particularly for poor households, whose situation was aggravated by the depletion of water resources over the last two decades. Finally, this extensive understanding of the agrarian context allowed us to formulate and assess the potential of different ways forward, including irrigation technology, change in cropping or livestock systems, land tenure, and value added distribution. As such, this analysis would be of major interest to policy makers involved in reforming the agricultural context for better agricultural water management.

TI  - Micro-agricultural water management technologies for food security in southern Africa: part of the solution or a red herring?
PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper is based on a review of experiences with a wide range of micro-agricultural water management technologies in sub-Saharan Africa with a special emphasis on southern Africa. The major finding of the study is that these technologies have the potential to make major contributions to improving food security, reducing rural poverty and promoting broad-based agricultural growth. However, there are serious policy impediments to successfully scaling out the use of these technologies at both national and regional levels. The paper makes seven specific policy recommendations whose implementation would enable promotion of wider uptake.

PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper analyzed the factors determining participation in irrigation project on agro pastoral household and their perception towards the scheme. The study result depends on cross-sectional data collected from a sample of 144 households of which 72 irrigation users and 72 non-users using a combination of multistage, stratified and random sampling. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to assess factors that affect participation in irrigation. Result revealed that agro pastoralists do have medium to very strong perception towards different aspects of irrigation performance indicator variable. It is observed that among the variables in logistic regression age, sex, income, input use and participation in cooperative organization have affected participation significantly and positively, while, farm experience, distance to the district market, and total livestock unit, affected participation in irrigation significantly and negatively. The study has also substantiated that irrigation in the study area has significant role on income and recommend that it shall be great and rewarding if policy makers, designers, implementers, and any funding agencies with similar interest. Further, capitalize and scale up the project to achieve the development plan and objective. Int. J. Agril. Res. Innov. & Tech. 5 (2): 44-50, December, 2015

TI  - Improving Irrigation in Remote Areas: Multi-Objective Optimization of a Treadle Pump
PY  - 2014
AB  - Water-lifting technologies in rural areas of the developing world have enormous potential to stimulate agricultural and economic growth. The treadle pump, a human-powered low-cost pump designed for irrigation in developing countries, can help farmers maximize financial return on small plots of land by ending their dependency on rain-fed irrigation systems. The treadle pump uses a suction piston to draw groundwater to the surface by way of a foot-powered treadle attached to each suction piston. Current treadle pump designs lift water from depths up to 7 meters at a flow-rate of 1–5 liters per second. This work seeks to optimize the design of the Dekhi style treadle pump, which has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity. A mathematical model of the working fluid and treadle pump structure has been developed in this study. Deterministic optimization methods are then employed to maximize the flow rate of the groundwater pumped, maximize the lift height, and minimize the volume of material used for manufacturing. Design variables for the optimization included the dimensions of the pump, well depth, and speed of various parts of the system. The solutions are subject to constraints on the geometry of the system, the bending stress in the treadles, and ergonomic factors. Findings indicate that significant technical improvements can be made on the standard Dekhi design, such as increasing the size of the pump cylinders and hose, while maintaining a standard total treadle length. These improvements could allow the Dekhi pump to be implemented in new regions and benefit additional rural farmers in the developing world.Copyright © 2014 by ASME

TI  - Irrigation water productivity in Cambodian rice systems
PY  - 2013
AB  - Knowledge of the marginal productivity of water is crucial for decisions about its allocation between uses, which is particularly important in the context of increasing competition for water. Using primary, plot-level panel data, this article estimates the marginal productivity of water from supplementary irrigation in lowland rice systems in Cambodia, taking into account farmer and plot heterogeneity as well as self-selection of supplementary irrigation. Our estimates indicate a range of elasticities for rice output with respect to water inputs of between 0.057 and 0.069 for wet season production, substantially lower than previous estimates based on either aggregate or trial data. We discuss the policy implications of these results, in particular with respect to the utility of demand management policies and the challenges they pose to the decentralization of water management to Farmer Water Users Groups.

TI  - IMPROVING FARMERS’ ACCESS TO IRRIGATION IN THE BUFFER ZONE: AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONSERVE BIODIVERISTY IN THE CHITWAN NATIONAL PARK
PY  - 2013
AB  - Drawing results from multi-scale studies, this paper addresses the important coexistence between the Chitwan National Park and buffer-zone farmers’ communities in the East Rapti River basin of Nepal. The relationship between the two is discussed using results of land use change (1978–2010) and water availability analysis (1976–2010). At basin level, though there are indications of losses of the government forest, the utilizable outflow of water in the river is still abundant because the process of depletion of water is very low. Scaling down to local level, irrigation systems originating in the river were evaluated and farmers interviewed across locations. There were statistical differences in irrigation system performance affecting water availability for crop production in the buffer zone. Because irrigation plays a disproportionately greater role in farm income and economic water scarcity could be removed, improvement in access to irrigation could effectively help improve food sufficiency and reduce income disparity in this basin. In the forest of the national park, encroachment seems to be low but frequencies of rhino poaching and timber pilferage have remained relatively high. As the buffer zone is the gateway to the park, and subsistence farm families live on the fringes of the park, helping irrigation development would strengthen farmers’ cooperation in enhancing resource conservation of the park. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. RESUME Base sur les resultats de plusieurs etudes a differentes echelles, ce document traite de l'importance de la coexistence entre le parc national de Chitwan et les communautes d'agriculteurs de la zone tampon, dans le bassin de la riviere Rapti a l'est du Nepal. La relation entre les deux est discutee a partir des resultats de changements de l'utilisation des terres (1978–2010) et de l'analyse de la disponibilite en eau (1976–2010). Au niveau du bassin, bien qu'il y ait des signes de deprise des forets d'etat, le prelevement potentiel d'eau dans la riviere est encore important, car le processus d'epuisement de l'eau est tres faible. Au niveau local, les systemes d'irrigation alimentes par la riviere ont ete evalues, et les agriculteurs ont ete interroges par zone geographique. Il y avait des differences statistiques dans les performances des systemes d'irrigation qui affectent la disponibilite de l'eau pour la production agricole dans la zone tampon. Parce que l'irrigation joue un role proportionnellement plus fort dans le revenu agricole, l'irrigation pourrait supprimer la penurie economique liee au manque d'eau. L'amelioration de l'acces a l'irrigation pourrait contribuer efficacement a ameliorer l'autosuffisance alimentaire et a reduire la disparite des revenus dans ce bassin. Dans la foret du parc national, l'empietement semble faible, mais les frequences de braconnage de rhinoceros et de vols de bois ont garde un niveau relativement eleve. Comme la zone tampon est la porte d'entree du parc, et que l'agriculture vivriere retient les familles d'agriculteurs dans la peripherie du parc, aider le developpement de l'irrigation permettrait de renforcer la cooperation des agriculteurs dans la conservation des ressources et l'amelioration du parc.

TI  - THE LINKAGES BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL INPUT AND FOOD PRODUCTION IN LEAST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>Food is among the basic human needs for social development. Sufficiency of food depends not only on domestic food production but also on food imports and food aid. However, all countries need to increase their food production to fulfil domestic sufficiency so they will not be too dependent on food imports and food aid. This paper examines the linkages between agriculture input and food production in the least developing countries. The data sets of the variables in this paper were obtained from FAOSTAT and the variables were considered throughout the analysis were food production index, fertilizers consumption, land irrigation, gross fixed capital formation, and employment in the agriculture sector. The static panel data was adopted using fixed effect and the findings of this study showed that fertilizer, land irrigation, and capital formation in the agriculture sector positively significantly give an impact to food production in the least developing countries. In accordance with the objectives of this study, land irrigation provides a huge impact on food production. The governments, in partnership with public and private institutions, need to work toward defining and implementing comprehensive strategies for irrigation development</jats:p>

TI  - Assessment of Factors That Affect the Performance of Agricultural Production, in the Case of Amhara Region, Ethiopia
PY  - 2018
AB  - The agricultural sector is the basis of livelihood for a large proportion of society in Ethiopia. In the three political regimes in modern Ethiopia, the Imperial, the military and the Ethiopian people revolutionary democratic front (EPRDF), agriculture has been regarded as a critical sector. The Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI) is the national policy of the country. Regardless of the government policy attention and investment, there is a long way to go for smallholders to ensure food self-sufficiency. Agriculture is the base of our food, transformation to industrialization, climatic change control system. Agriculture is the soul of our sovereignty for development as well as poverty reduction for individuals and country level. In Ethiopia, population density is high and has been increasing and agricultural land has been decreasing because of fragmenting or converting it into residential plots. To meet the domestic food requirements, use of improved production technologies developed by research is come out to be important. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze factors that affect the performance of agricultural products in Amahara region national state and to determine the highly significant input factors for producing high and qualified agricultural outputs. Data regarding total agricultural outputs and its input factors in study area of Amahara region from 2010 to 2018 was obtained from Amhara national state branch of the Ethiopian institute of agricultural sector. Correlation analyses were used to examine the strength of the relationship between each of the determinant factors with total agricultural output, while multiple regression analysis was employed to examine the simultaneous effects of several independent variables on the dependent variable, total agricultural outputs. These analyses were employed through the packages R and Stata to achieve the main objectives of the study. All of the independent variables were highly correlated with the total agricultural output. The overall regression model was highly significant (p-value < 0.01) with F = 45.532. The R-squared value implies that 93.8% percent of the changes in average total agricultural outputs are successfully explained by the variables used in the model of this study. If we take model size into account, 91.8% percent of the variation in average total agricultural output was explained by the values of the independent variables. Specifically, among the independent variables irrigated land, fertilizer, improved seed and pesticides are the most significant factors for total products (p-value < 0.05).

TI  - Efficiency of irrigation water application in sugarcane cultivation in Pakistan
PY  - 2014
AB  - BACKGROUND Diminishing irrigation water supplies are threatening the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. Within the context of dwindling water resources and low agricultural water productivity, it is imperative to improve efficiency in agricultural production and to make efficient use of available water resources. This study employs a non-parametric approach to estimate the extent of technical and irrigation water efficiency in sugarcane cultivation in Pakistan. RESULTS The mean technical efficiency score is 0.96 for tube-well owners whereas it is 0.94 for water buyers. The mean irrigation water efficiency score is 0.86 for tube-well owners whereas it is 0.72 for water buyers. We find that across all farms, 59% of the tube-well owners and 45% of the water buyers are fully technically efficient, whereas only 36% of the tube-well owners and 30% of the water buyer are fully efficient in irrigation water use. CONCLUSIONS This study finds that sugarcane growers are operating at fairly high technical efficiency levels. But, there is considerable potential to improve irrigation water efficiency. This study proposes expanding the role of agricultural extension services from merely agronomic grounds to guide farmers to undertake cost benefit analysis of the available production technology, would help achieve higher efficiency levels. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Evaluating the impact on farm households : a multicomponent irrigation program in Peru
PY  - 2010
AB  - This report presents findings of an impact evaluation of a rural irrigation investment program with multiple components in coastal Peru. It addresses three questions: whether the program was effective, whether the program’s multicomponent design contributed to its effectiveness, and whether the program had spillover effects. The primary audiences for this report are development practitioners engaged in designing similar projects, evaluators interested in using similar methodology, and the general evaluation community. The rest of this report is organized as follows. Chapter 1 briefly explains how irrigation projects transmit their impacts, identifies potential areas of concern for this type of project, and illustrates these with experiences in water-related projects around the world. Another section in this chapter provides some necessary background on the agricultural sector in Peru, past and present, and a brief description of the irrigation program and each of its components. Chapter 2 discusses the mixed-methods approach used in the impact evaluation, focusing on data description. Chapter 3 elaborates on the technical strategy used to identify impacts. Chapter 4 presents and discusses the findings. Chapter 5 presents concluding remarks.

TI  - Analysis of seasonal land use in Usangu wetlands, Tanzania: an object-oriented technique for multi-temporal analysis with high-resolution data
PY  - 2011
AB  - A multi-temporal analysis of Landsat panchromatic data was applied to the Usanga wetlands in Tanzania, where there are concerns that irrigated agricultural development is reducing downstream water availability. As there are many small fields, and even smaller areas of continuous vegetable cultivation throughout the year, 15-m resolution multi-temporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) panchromatic data, acquired in the months of March, May and October, were used to extract information on the seasonal land use/cover in order to investigate agricultural water use. Object-oriented analysis was used to interpret these high-resolution data through definition of image segments, which were then classified using a pixel-based unsupervised classification method. This hybrid approach helps to process high-resolution data quickly and efficiently, so as to economically and effectively understand and classify land use/cover in highly heterogeneous and seasonally dynamic tropical conditions, where land units are typically small.

TI  - Small-scale irrigation scheme governance - poverty nexus: evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigated agriculture has been popularized as a key factor to improve crop yields and enhance food security in Africa. However, empirical findings are mixed. This study analyzes determinants of small-scale irrigation adoption and the impact this may have on food security in Ethiopia, where agricultural land is extremely fragmented and densely populated. Data were collected from 240 farmers, and the findings from the survey were triangulated with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. First, the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices indicated high poverty levels among farmers without access to irrigation. Second, accounting for a self-selection bias by using the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model, scheme governance, perceived water scarcity, and access to information were found to have significant effects on the adoption of irrigation schemes. Model estimates further indicated that access to small-scale irrigation resulted in better living conditions for both current users and non-users when compared to their counterfactual situations. Farm income of the user households would decrease by 42% (birr 151,419 or US$ 5,500 per ha) had they not used irrigation. Similarly, farm income of the non-users would increase by 149% had they used irrigation. Per adult equivalent consumption expenditure has also shown a decrease of 35% for irrigation users and an increase of 40% for non-users compared to their respective counterfactual situations. We conclude that much of the perceived water scarcity level is attributed to existing governance regimes more than the physical scarcity of water. The study draws several implications for household food security and local-based water use policies.

TI  - Adoption of Small-Scale Irrigation Farming as a Climate-Smart Agriculture Practice and Its Influence on Household Income in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa
PY  - 2018
AB  - This article is concerned with the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice and its influence on household income in the Chinyanja Triangle. Chinyanja Triangle is a region that is increasingly experiencing mid-season dry spells and an increase in occurrence of drought, which is attributed largely to climate variability and change. This poses high agricultural production risks, which aggravate poverty and food insecurity. For this region, adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice is very important. Through a binary logistic and ordinary least squares regression, this article determines factors that influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice and its influence on income among smallholder farmers. The results show that off-farm employment, access to irrigation equipment, access to reliable water sources and awareness of water conservation practices, such as rainwater harvesting, have a significant influence on the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming. On the other hand, the farmer’s age, distance travelled to the nearest market and nature of employment negatively influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming decisions. Ordinary least squares regression results showed that the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice has a significant positive influence on agricultural income. We therefore conclude that to empower smallholder farmers to respond quickly to climate variability and change, practices that will enhance the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming in the Chinyanja Triangle are critical, as this will significantly affect agricultural income. In terms of policy, we recommend that the governments of Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, which cover the Chinyanja Triangle, formulate policies that will enhance the adoption of sustainable small scale-irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice. This will go a long way in mitigating the adverse effects that accompany climate variability and change in the region.

TI  - Making technological innovation work for sustainable development
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second, learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives) shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We conclude with three practice-oriented recommendations to further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development: (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.

TI  - Water statistics and poverty statistics in Africa: do they correlate at national scales?
PY  - 2011
AB  - There is a general consensus that agricultural water scarcity contributes to the severe levels of poverty observed in Africa. However, the results of analyses to determine whether a lack of water is either actively contributing to the poverty observed, or when it is incidental, have been inconsistent. This paper examines the extent to which country-level water statistics and poverty/development statistics align. The authors find limited correlation, suggesting either that the water–poverty relationship is relatively inconsequential, or more likely, that the aggregated nature of these statistics obscures the actual relationship. The authors suggest that variables that better capture spatial heterogeneity may help rectify this.

TI  - Impact of irrigation water scarcity on rural household food security and income in Pakistan
PY  - 2015
AB  - As Pakistan is currently facing a severe shortage of irrigation water, this paper analyzes the determinants of water scarcity and its impact on the yield of cereal crops (wheat, maize and rice), household income, food security and poverty levels by employing the propensity-score-matching approach. This study is based on a comprehensive set of cross-sectional data collected from 950 farmers from all four major provinces in Pakistan. The empirical analysis indicated that farmers with a water-scarcity problem have lower yield and household income, and are food insecure. Poverty levels were higher: in the range of 7–12% for a household facing a water-scarcity problem. The policy implications of the study are that the public and private sector in Pakistan needs to invest in irrigation water management to maintain the productivity of cereal crops which is important for household food security and poverty reduction.

TI  - Spatial patterns of rural poverty: an exploratory analysis in the São Francisco River Basin, Brazil
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper uses recently released municipio-level data on rural poverty in Brazil to identify and analyze spatial patterns of rural poverty in the Sao Francisco River Basin (SFRB). Moran's I statistics are generated and used to test for spatial autocorrelation, and to prepare cluster maps that locate rural poverty 'hot spots' and 'cold spots'. Our results indicate that poverty reduction policies in the SFRB should take into account the spatial distribution of poverty. Not only is poverty in the SFRB clustered spatially, but the bulk of the basin's poor resides in municipios that comprise the poverty 'hot spots' we identified. These clusters did not correspond to state-level boundaries (the political delineations often used to measure poverty and to manage poverty reduction programs), so scope may exist for geographically refocusing poverty reduction efforts to make them more efficient. Maybe more importantly the results set the stage for the use of spatial econometrics for a future multivariate analysis of rural poverty in the basin.

TI  - The potential of green ammonia for agricultural and economic development in Sierra Leone
PY  - 2021
AB  - Summary Sierra Leone is one of the least developed countries in the world, with an economy strangled by the necessity of importing rice to feed the population. In part, this deficit results from domestic farmers rarely using inorganic fertilizer, which is synthesized from fossil fuels internationally. Here, we evaluate the economic benefits of producing green ammonia from renewable local hydropower for low-carbon cost-effective fertilizer production. Its use as fertilizer estimates a 30-year net present value (NPV) of ∼$230M (∼165% return of investment) compared with simply importing fertilizers, which would already save at least $50M a year compared with the current situation of importing rice, but hinges on additional external factors related to implementing modern agriculture. In addition, green ammonia can buffer seasonal fluctuations of hydroelectricity from 900 MW to 50 MW and produce a consistently available 370 MW of power. Although this study presents an initial analysis of Sierra Leone as a case study, it exemplifies the possible economic and social benefits of green ammonia in developing countries.

TI  - Agricultural water development and households vulnerability to food insecurity: Empirical evidence from Eastern Hararghe Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The incidences of food insecurity and poverty are particularly devastating in the developing countries and a lot of resources are being channeled towards programs aimed at eradicating food insecurity. Improvement in access to agricultural water serves as a powerful tool to reduce vulnerability, since it creates options for extended production across the year and increases outputs. However, in some literatures, irrigated agriculture can be more vulnerable for environmental risks as compared to rain fed agriculture. Moreover, it remains unclear whether investment in irrigation infrastructure development led to the desired goals of reducing vulnerability to food insecurity. Therefore, this paper provides results of a study conducted to assess the impact of agricultural water in reducing household vulnerability to food insecurity in eastern Hararghe zone of Ethiopia. A multistage sampling technique was used to select sample household heads. Both Deder and Kersa districts were purposively selected due to availability of modern irrigation schemes. Both primary and secondary data collection methods were employed. Data analysis was involved through descriptive statistics and econometric models. The results of the study showed that increase in proportion of irrigated land size can significantly decrease households’ vulnerability to food insecurity. The study concluded that creating enabling environment in irrigation areas can further decreases households’ vulnerability to food insecurity.

TI  - Economic value of irrigation water: a case of major irrigation scheme in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2014
AB  - It is generally agreed that inefficient use of irrigation-water and poor performance of irrigation systems are critical issues; especially in the light of the apparent lack of water resources. This study attempts to determine the economic value of irrigation-water in a government properly managed irrigation project (GPMIP) by eliciting farmer’s willingness to pay (WTP) using contingent valuation method followed by single bounded dichotomous choices. A stepwise backward binary multivariate logistic regression model was used to measure WTP and to determine the factors that influence the variation in WTP. Primary data were obtained from 367 farmer households in Nagadeepa irrigation schemes in dry zone. The estimated value of irrigation water was Rs. 5,275 ($40) per hectare per season which is 8.6 percent of net income in paddy farming per hectare at present in selected irrigation scheme. Further, if farmers can increase further their household farming income by 5.9%, it is possible to cover additional cost which would be driven due to pricing irrigation water and it is not an unreachable challenge with proper irrigation services. One of the most important policy implications of this study is the possibility of restructuring the existing irrigation pricing system by taking into account the economic value of irrigation water. Such policy reform can encourage farmers to use irrigation resources efficiently by motivating improvement in water management practices and generating revenue for operation, maintenance and capital replacement and irrigation sustainability in the country.

TI  - Lisrel Analysis of Factors for Empowering Producers to Abolish Livelihood Poverty through Optimizing Agricultural Water Resources Management
PY  - 2010
AB  - Problem Statement: Most of the projected increase in global population will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Irrigation in developing countries tends to be stereotyped as equity reducing, in competition with other uses for scarce water resources. Agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction is examined. Water users were surveyed in order to explore their perception about the factors influencing the optimizing water consumption in agricultural sectors in Iran. This study looks into water-poverty interfaces as well as into approaches to and tools of, managing water in such a manner that water sector activities can contribute to alleviation of poverty. In addition, this study aims to empower water users with information on agricultural wastewater. Approach: The methodology used in this study involved a combination of descriptive and quantitative research. The total population was 350 producers in six provinces in Iran. Results: Based on the perception of the respondents and ordinal factor analysis, the factors were categorized into four groupâs namely technical and practical, recognition and managing water equipment and constructive ordered by the magnitude of their impact. The total variance explained by these 4 factors is 54.27% as effective mechanisms in optimizing agricultural water resources management. Structural equation model is expected to be useful for designing targeted optimizing agricultural water resources management and poverty alleviation strategies that also enhance agricultural-productivity growth. Conclusion/Recommendations: Where there is equity in resource distribution, the impact of improved water management on agricultural productivity growth has been more poverty reducing. Using water better means improving the productivity of agricultural water in both irrigated and rainfed systems, through multiple-use water system, integrated water resources planning, and targeted research.

TI  - Global Change and Investments in Smallholder Irrigation for Food and Nutrition Security in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2020
AB  - Investments in irrigation contribute to poverty reduction and enhance food security. This paper considers irrigation investments more broadly in the context of rural–urban linkages and thus examines rural irrigation schemes and peri-urban and urban agriculture using freshwater, groundwater and wastewater. We present case studies from East, West and Southern Africa, while focusing on the imperative of smallholders and of food security and nutrition. Evidence from Big Data and telecoupling show that, amid global change and sustainability issues, irrigation development strengthens connections between humans and nature with notable benefits to food security. Transforming investments to feed the future generation require priority investments in irrigation, solar energy for groundwater pumping, groundwater development policy, and integration of peri-urban and urban agriculture into food systems. Equally important will be no-regret interventions in wastewater reuse, water storage and groundwater buffer, micro-irrigation, and wholesale reconfiguration of farming systems, through anticipatory investments, to safeguard food security and sustainability into the distant future.

TI  - Irrigation et pauvreté : le cas de l'Office du Niger au Mali
PY  - 2011
AB  - Surveys were carried out in 2004 in the Office du Niger in Mali, to assess the contribution of irrigation schemes to poverty reduction. Results show that the situation is better in the Office du Niger than in any of the other rural areas in Mali, including the Segou region. The investments in irrigation schemes have contributed to strong agricultural growth and a reduction in poverty amongst smallholder farmers. However, this positive effect is eroding because of the deterioration of production conditions, and a reduction in average size of fields due to a combination of population growth and a decrease in the area allocated to smallholders. New attributions are being granted to the private sector.

TI  - Is the Role of Irrigation in Agricultural Output Declining in India?: A District-Wise Study at Six Time Points
PY  - NA
AB  - The significant role of irrigation development in land use pattern, cropping pattern, cropping intensity, production and productivity of crops has been well documented by various studies in India. However, the contributions of irrigation to agricultural output and related parameters are fervently questioned in the recent years. Since the role of irrigation in increasing the value of agricultural output has not been studied by many scholars especially using disaggregated data covering different time points, an attempt has been made in this study to fill this gap by using cross-sectional data for 235 Indian districts, drawn from 13 states at six time points: 1962-65, 1970-73, 1980-83, 1990-93, 2003-05 and 2005-08. Both descriptive and regression analyses have been carried out to study the relationship. Descriptive analysis shows that the difference in value of agricultural output per hectare has narrowed down between less ( 50 per cent) irrigated districts over the years, especially after 1990-93. The univariate regression analysis carried out treating irrigation (with and without dummy as well as with and without time lag) as an independent variable and the value of agricultural output per hectare as dependent variable shows that the impact of irrigation on the value of output has declined (both irrigation coefficient and R 2 ) over time. During 1980-83 and 1990-93, irrigation alone has explained around 50 per cent of variation in agricultural output, but the same declined to about 24 per cent during 2003-05 and 2005-08. Multivariate regression analysis carried out by using different yield increasing and infrastructure variables suggests that although irrigation still plays a dominant role in increasing the value of output, its value of coefficients has been declining over time. Although both univariate and multivariate regression results show a declining trend of irrigation coefficient over time, one may not be able to firmly say that the role of irrigation in determining the value of agricultural output has reduced over time, as this could have happened due to acceleration in the productivity of crops cultivated in the rainfed/less irrigated districts.

TI  - The criticality of integrating local agro-economic institutions into paradigms for least developed countries in the epoch of the Anthropocene
PY  - 2015
AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interlinks and provides for the two most critical issues for human and ecological sustainability: providing food for impending population growth to reduce poverty and undernourishment, and managing for eco-system resilience in the context of global environmental change. Implementation of CSA in smallholder communities in the least developed countries (LDCs) has proven successful but has not been widely adopted. This paper examines the constraints to replicable and generalizable adoption of CSA methodologies and posits that the absence of professional, local, agro-economic institutions is a key variable that explains the stagnation of agricultural production and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. The strategies of the development community (NGOs, development banks, international and national aid institutions) focus on funding large scale irrigation projects, encouraging and supporting new technologies, and correcting perceived market failures. The development community has not engaged professional agricultural organizations and institutions and this disconnect has led to ineffective interventions on the part of the development community. This paper further posits that farming is not an activity that can be sustained by the strategies and tactics of the development community. Agriculture is a business enterprise that requires local agro-economic institutional support.

TI  - Downstream and Coastal Impacts of Damming and Water Abstraction in Africa
PY  - 2007
AB  - Anthropogenic factors associated with damming and water abstraction, and the resultant environmental pressures, are reviewed in six African river catchments using records and forecasts of climatic, demographic, and land-use change. Changes in the states of the flow regime through catchment drainage systems to the coastal sea are considered in conjunction with climate change and other human-induced pressures. The impacts of these changes on downstream and coastal environments and their communities are described in past, present, and future perspectives. Linkages between the issues and the pressures of damming and water abstraction are appraised and scientific, policy, and management responses proposed aimed at remedying existing and perceived future negative impacts. The study proposes that there is a need to integrate catchment and coastal management to account for the whole water flow regime together with its human dimensions. Management priorities relating to the operation of existing damming and abstraction schemes and planning of future schemes include the following: consideration of ways in which water discharges could be adjusted to provide improvements in downstream and coastal environmental and socioeconomic conditions; addressing the problem of sediment trapping impacting on the sustainability of dam reservoirs; and assessment of downstream and coastal impacts of future schemes in the light of climate change forecasts.

TI  - Predicting water allocations and trading prices to assist water markets
PY  - 2009
AB  - Uncertain water allocations and water trading prices are a key constraint to efficient irrigated cropping and water trading decisions. This study shows that neural network models can reasonably forecast seasonal allocations and trading prices in water markets. These models can complement other forecasting techniques such as regression analysis and time series models as the former can better capture the non-linearities in the water trading system. Using a 50% probability risk factor for water variability, the water allocation model showed minor estimation error; however, in one instance the model underestimated the water allocation by 21%. This may be due to exceptionally low initial water allocations and borrowing of water from future years which was outside the training data sets. Similarly, the water trading price forecast model showed modest estimation error of about 11% during 2004/05 probably due to drought. Overall the models have good water allocation and price forecasting accuracy, and the determinants of water trading prices identified by the neural network models are those expected of the econometric models/economic theory.

TI  - The impact of the homestead food garden programme on food security in South Africa
PY  - 2018
AB  - The South African government has implemented homestead food garden (HFG) programmes directed at enhancing food production in order to reduce food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty and hunger. The present paper evaluated the impact of this programme on household food insecurity using surveys of 500 households. Endogenous switching regression, propensity score matching and household food insecurity average scores were employed in our analysis. Our findings demonstrated that participation in an HFG programme could significantly enhance the food security status of participants by increasing household food supply and consumption as well as by income derived from selling any excess production from the garden. Specifically, our empirical findings showed that participation in the HFG programme significantly reduced food insecurity among rural households by as much as 41.5%. Therefore, we recommend that policy makers should encourage more rural households to participate in the programme in order to reduce their food insecurity. Facilitating easy access to credit, extension services, fertilizer, irrigation facilities and land are policy options needed to promote farmers participation in HFG programmes. Furthermore, the formation of farmer-based organizations and the building of positive perceptions about HFGs are some of the key policy options that can be employed to improve households’ participation in the programme. Promotion of education, participating in off-farm activities, access to market, irrigation, extension and credit, and adoption of fertiliser are some policy interventions that can reduce food insecurity among rural house holds whether or not they participate in the HFG programme.

TI  - Financial performance of India’s irrigation sector: a historical analysis
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractIndia’s public irrigation sector is one of the largest in the world in terms of number of large reservoirs, total storage capacity and irrigated area. But poor financial performance has been threatening its sustainability. Hence, many changes have been introduced in the area of water pricing over the years. But studies that focus on the issue of financial recovery are scanty. Analysis presented in the article shows that despite a substantial increase in area under irrigation, there has been a consistent decline in revenue generated from irrigation fee collection across states. The recovery rate of irrigation fees has been better in less developed states than in more developed states.

TI  - Economic Evaluation of Poverty Alleviation by the National Program for Community Empowerment in Western Part of Rural Indonesia
PY  - 2015
AB  - This study is aimed to evaluate community empowerment program known as PNPM Mandiri in terms of block grant allocations whether they are proven to impact poverty reduction in Indonesia. It is documented that economic and agriculture allocation play significant role in alleviating poverty as they are deemed as economical investment for rural entities. Another result suggested that transportation, economic, together with agricultural sector have particular relationship as grouped as economic capital that they could not be separated each other which, one treated to be increase, subsequently other sector will tend to increase as well. However, the notion of human capital personified into social, health, and education budget do not show significantly different due to particular reasons comprising elite dominance, poor healthcare delivery, and unequal expenditure of education distribution within family, respectively. The findings is fruitful in order to project more efficient budget allocation either to diversify variety of PNPM program to fasten and optimize poverty eradication.

TI  - Frontiers of the food–energy–water trilemma: Sri Lanka as a microcosm of tradeoffs
PY  - 2016
AB  - Food, energy, and water are three critical resources for humanity. As climate variability, population growth, and lifestyle changes amplify the stress placed on each of the resources, the interrelationships among food, energy, and water systems become more pronounced. Political conflict, social and cultural norms, and spatial and temporal distribution of the resources add additional layers of complexity. It is in this context that the significance of understanding the impacts of water scarcity on the decisions around food and energy productions has emerged. Our work establishes tradeoff frontiers (TFs) as a method useful in illustrating the system-level tradeoffs between allocating water for food and water for energy. This paper illustrates how TFs can be used to (1) show how scarcity in water resources affects the tradeoffs between food and energy and (2) explore the political and social constraints that can move production away from what is feasible technically. We use Sri Lanka, a country where water resources are variable both in space and time and a country with relatively self-contained energy and agricultural sectors, as a microcosm of the food security, energy security, and water security trilemma. Nevertheless, our application of tradeoff frontiers is applicable widely to other systems.

TI  - Will future water professionals sink under received wisdom, or swim to a new Paradigm?†
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper challenges water professionals to ask fundamental questions about public actions for water resources development and currently accepted knowledge and skills used to pursue these actions. It critically examines three common assumptions underlying the current water resources development paradigm: that “water security” is a necessary condition for economic growth and lack of it is preventing development of poor countries; that achieving water security requires massive public infrastructure development; and “stakeholder consultation” is sufficient to minimize potential social and environmental damage while maximizing equitable benefit sharing. Using examples from Africa, the paper raises questions about these assumptions and suggests there are alternative agricultural water interventions that cost less and have higher benefits. The lack of sufficient attention to alternatives to large-scale infrastructure reflects the failure of water professionals to recognize the political nature of water development. The conclusion poses five sets of research questions and encourages students to pursue these while questioning the normal water resources development paradigm. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Cet article demande aux professionnels de l'eau de poser les questions fondamentales sur les actions publiques pour le developpement des ressources en eau, sur les savoirs acceptes et competences utilisees actuellement pour poursuivre ces actions. Il propose un examen critique de trois hypotheses communes sous-jacentes au paradigme actuel du developpement des ressources en eau: “la securite de l'eau” est une condition necessaire pour la croissance economique et son absence empeche le developpement des pays pauvres; realiser la securite de l'eau exige un developpement massif des infrastructure publique; la consultation des acteurs est suffisante pour reduire au minimum les dommages potentiels sociaux et environnementaux tout en maximisant le partage equitable des avantages. En utilisant des exemples en Afrique, l'article questionne ces hypotheses et suggere des interventions alternatives sur l'eau agricole qui coutent moins cher avec des benefices plus eleves. Le manque d'attention a des solutions alternatives aux grandes infrastructures montre l'incapacite des professionnels de l'eau a reconnaitre la nature politique du developpement de l'eau. La conclusion pose cinq series de questions de recherche et encourage les etudiants a les aborder en questionnant le paradigme admis sur le developpement des ressources en eau.

TI  - an exploratory analysis in the São Francisco River Basin, Brazil
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper uses recently released municipio-level data on rural poverty in Brazil to identify and analyze spatial patterns of rural poverty in the Sao Francisco River Basin (SFRB) . Moran’s I statistics are generated and used to test for spatial autocorrelation, and to prepare cluster maps that locate rural poverty “hot spots” and “cold spots”. Our results indicate that poverty reduction policies in the SFRB should take into account the spatial distribution of poverty. Not only is poverty in the SFRB clustered spatially, but the bulk of the basin’s poor resides in municipios that comprise the poverty ‘hot spots’ we identified. These clusters did not correspond to state-level boundaries (the political delineations often used to measure poverty and to manage poverty reduction programs), so scope may exist for geographically refocusing poverty reduction efforts to make them more efficient. Maybe more importantly the results set the stage for the use of spatial econometrics for a future multivariate analysis of rural poverty in the basin.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Environmental Impact of pump irrigation projects from Lake Tana (Megech - Seraba, Tana Asrate, Tana Mekonta, Tana Wenjeta, and Tana Zegie) was studied from July 2018 to February 2019. Interactions between project activities and environmental parameters were also done by a matrix, and quantitative and qualitative analysis. As a result, identified positive impacts are new job creation, the opportunity to promote traditional agriculture and income increase, whereas land, fisheries and wetland degradation, pollution, deforestation and wildlife, inefficient water use, the decline in soil fertility, erosion, sedimentation, small aquatic animal death, and cumulative impacts are negative ones. Mitigation measures for these impacts to reduce their effects to the minimum level and recommendations have been proposed so that the execution of the projects becomes a success without harming or with the least negative effect on the environment.

TI  - Irrigation projects in Ethiopia: what can be done to enhance effectiveness under ‘challenging contexts’?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Investment in small scale irrigation (SSI) is crucial to sustain food security and livelihoods of smallholders. In Ethiopia, the government and development partners show a growing interest in developing irrigation projects. The success of irrigation projects is determined by governance and socio-cultural contexts. Yet the lack of thorough understanding of the challenging contexts undermines the efforts to achieve sustainability outcomes in irrigation projects. This article identifies the challenging contexts to irrigation projects, examines how the challenging contexts influence the effectiveness of irrigation projects, and indicates ways of improving the effectiveness of irrigation projects under the existing challenging contexts. Data were collected between April and December 2011 in three regional states of Ethiopia using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The lack of governance capacity and accountability are critical challenges for the sustainability of the irrigation projects. In addit...

TI  - Direct and indirect benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation: evidence and lessons
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper is a part of the multi-country study carried out by the author at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with national partners in six Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) during 2001–2002. Based mainly on primary data collected from 5400 households in 26 irrigation systems, the study examines in detail the benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation. The results indicate that irrigation benefits vary widely across systems, and depend on a range of factors including local conditions, system management, irrigation policy, and broader economic and political factors. The study suggests that indirect irrigation benefits could be larger than direct benefits through the multiplier effect. The distribution of irrigation benefits also varies widely by type of the benefit and the socio-economic status of the beneficiaries. The direct benefits generally accrue to landholders while a significant part of the indirect benefits accrue to the landless and small farmers, positively contributing to their livelihoods. Further, the overall benefits of irrigation are large when irrigation- improving interventions, investments in infrastructure, improvements in system management and service delivery to farmers, are implemented in an integrated manner. On the other hand, the paper also suggests that irrigation can also lead to some negative or adverse social, health and environmental impacts. Such potential disbenefits of irrigation include displacement of people as a result of new irrigation development, public health risks from water-related diseases, irrigation-induced land and water degradation, loss of biodiversity and river health risks from increased river water withdrawals for irrigation. Often, negative social and environmental consequences adversely affect the poor more than the non-poor people. Most potential adverse impacts of irrigation are not due to irrigation water per se, but due to inadequacies and ineffectiveness of institutions and management to address them. Moreover, many of the potential adverse impacts can be avoided or minimized with effective planning, design and management of the projects. This paper develops and offers a generic typology of direct and indirect benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation that can be used to identify and influence different types of irrigation benefits and disbenefits for enhancing net benefits to the poor.

TI  - Agro-ecosystems impact malaria prevalence: large-scale irrigation drives vector population in western Ethiopia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Development strategies in Ethiopia have largely focused on the expansion of irrigated agriculture in the last decade to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. However, such irrigation schemes can worsen the socio-economic state by aggravating the problem of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, the effect of agro-ecosystem practices on malaria prevalence and the risk of malaria transmission by the primary vector mosquito, Anopheles arabiensis, in Ethiopia were investigated. In three villages in western Ethiopia practising large-scale sugarcane irrigation, traditional smallholder irrigation and non-irrigated farming, cross-sectional parasitological surveys were conducted during the short rains, after the long rains and during the dry season. Entomological surveys were undertaken monthly (February 2010-January 2011) in each village using light traps, pyrethrum spray collections and artificial pit shelters. Malaria prevalence and the risk of transmission by An. arabiensis assessed by the average human biting rate, mean sporozoite rate and estimated annual entomological inoculation rate were significantly higher in the irrigated sugarcane agro-ecosystem compared to the traditionally irrigated and non-irrigated agro-ecosystems. The average human biting rate was significantly elevated by two-fold, while the mean sporozoite rate was 2.5-fold higher, and the annual entomological inoculation rate was 4.6 to 5.7-fold higher in the irrigated sugarcane compared to the traditional and non-irrigated agro-ecosystems. Active irrigation clearly affected malaria prevalence by increasing the abundance of host seeking Anopheles mosquitoes year-round and thus increasing the risk of infective bites. The year-round presence of sporozoite-infected vectors due to irrigation practices was found to strengthen the coupling between rainfall and risk of malaria transmission, both on- and off-season. This study demonstrates the negative impact of large-scale irrigation expansion on malaria transmission by increasing the abundance of mosquito vectors and indicates the need for effective vector monitoring and control strategies in the implementation of irrigation projects.

AB  - Objective: Determine with an empirical study that the use of wastewater received by the agricultural sector of the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo for more than one hundred years, from the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico without prior treatment, configured the agricultural space in this region not suitable for this activity due to its geographical and climatic conditions. Methodology: A review of the literature of the problem of wastewater in combination with quantitative information from different institutions to make and an analysis to the ecological economy discipline that identifies the factors that make it the trigger of important social and environmental problems. Results: It was identified that the use of this type of water in the agricultural sector of the region, contains a high pollutant load composed of organic material, some metals, bacteria and detergents, which allowed the development of the sector together with severe public health problems and soil degradation. Limitations: Lack of recent studies that document the implications on the health of the population and ecosystems of the region. Conclusions: The reconfiguration of spaces to determine regions does not necessarily imply social and environmental benefit in some cases it implies the detriment of the quality of life and degradation of the ecosystems. However, for part of the population of the region the use of this water has allowed them to leave the conditions of marginality in which they lived.

TI  - Infrastructure and Growth
PY  - 2013
AB  - While a high rate of economic growth does not necessarily reduce inequality or poverty, there seems to be a consensus among researchers and policy makers that continuous, rapid economic growth is required for poverty alleviation. Governments around the world are continually looking for new strategies to increase the ability of their economies to produce goods and services. In this light, over the last two decades, economists have developed more sophisticated models to evaluate the potential economic impacts of different supply-side policies that aim to raise the productive capacity of the economy. Specifically, alongside modelling the main factors of production – physical capital and labour – these models seek to account for the concurrent use of non-traditional inputs, such as public infrastructure and education, as key contributing factors to economic growth.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Poverty continues to present an enormous challenge to the well-being of humanity. Different frameworks on poverty tend to identify different persons as poor, impacting on efforts to fight poverty. The church as a role player in the public domain needs a framework that can assist it in its task of working for salvation and liberation in the face of overwhelming poverty. Acombined framework, from Amartya Sen’s entitlement approach and capability approach, is amalgamated and suggested as an integrated framework that could act as a lens or a viewpoint from which the church could venture to conceptualise, quantify and respond to instances of poverty. Keywords: Poverty; Church; Well-being; Amartya Sen; Entitlement Approach; Capability Approach

TI  - Poverty Reduction of Sustainable Development Goals in the 21st Century: A Bibliometric Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - No Poverty is the top priority among 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research perspectives, methods, and subject integration of studies on poverty reduction have been greatly developed with the advance of practice in the 21st century. This paper analyses 2459 papers on poverty reduction since 2000 using VOSviewer software and R language. Our conclusions show that (1) the 21st century has seen a sharp increase in publications of poverty reduction, especially the period from 2015 to date. (2) The divergence in research quantity and quality between China and Kenya is great. (3) Economic studies focus on inequality and growth, while environmental studies focus on protection and management mechanisms. (4) International cooperation is usually related to geographical location and conducted by developed countries with developing countries together. (5) Research on poverty reduction in different regions has specific sub-themes. Our findings provide an overview of the state of the research and suggest that there is a need to strengthen the integration of disciplines and pay attention to the contribution of marginal disciplines to poverty reduction research in the future.

TI  - Technical Efficiency Of Paddy Farming Under Major Irrigation Conditions In The Dry-Zone Of Sri Lanka: A Parametric Approach
PY  - 2013
AB  - Available literature suggests that paddy farmers in the developing countries fail to exploit the full potential of a technology and make allocative errors. Thus, increasing the efficiency in paddy production assumes greater significance in attaining potential output at the farm level. However it is an undeniable fact that the majority of dry zone paddy farmers are characterized by poor economic status due to inefficient utilization of available resources. This paper investigates the technical efficiency of rice farming in a major irrigation schemes in Sri Lanka and to suggest some policy recommendation for improving the efficiency of resource use in paddy industry under major irrigation conditions. The experiment site was a Nagadeepa reservoir in Mahiyanganaya. The empirical study was carried based on a sample of 357 paddy farmers under Nagadeepa reservoir. In this study, the technical efficiency of paddy farmers was estimated by using stochastic frontier production function, incorporating technical efficiency effect model. The Traslog production function was found to be an adequate representation of the data. According to the results obtained from the stochastic frontier estimation, the average technical efficiency of selected farmers given by the Traslog model is 72.80 per cent. This indicates that there is scope of farther increasing the output by 27.2 percent without increasing the level of input.

TI  - Interaction between deep and shallow groundwater systems in areas affected by Quaternary tectonics (Central Italy): a geochemical and isotope approach
PY  - 2010
AB  - Hydro- and isotope geochemistry are used to refine groundwater conceptual models in two areas of central Italy (Acque Albule Basin and Velino River Valley) affected by extensional Quaternary tectonics, where deep and shallow groundwater flow systems are interacting. The role of geology, of recent deposits filling the plains and of main tectonic features controlling groundwater flowpaths and deep-seated fluids emergences are investigated and discussed. Environmental isotopes (2H and 18O) confirm recharge in the surrounding carbonate aquifers, and meteoric origin of both shallow and deep groundwater. Major ion chemistry indicates a mixing between shallow Ca-HCO3 groundwater from carbonate aquifers and deep Ca-HCO3-SO4 groundwater, characterised by higher salinity and temperature and high concentration in sulphates. Isotopic composition of dissolved sulphates (δ 34S and δ 18O) and dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13C), henceforth indicated as DIC, are used to verify the presence of different sources of groundwater, and to validate the mixing model suggested by the major ion analyses. Sulphate isotope composition suggests a marine origin for the groundwater characterised by elevated sulphate concentration, whose source is present in the deep buried sequences. Carbon isotope composition confirms the role of a DIC source associated to CO2 degassing of a deep reservoir. Groundwater conceptual models are improved underlining the importance of Plio-Pleistocene sequences filling the tectonic depression. In the Acque Albule area, the travertine plateau represents a mixing stratified aquifer, where deep groundwater contribution is spread into the shallow aquifer. The alluvial–clastic–lacustrine leaky aquifer of Velino Valley enables a complete mixing of shallow and deep groundwater allowing spot-located discharge of deep groundwater along tectonic patterns and facilitating sulphate reduction in the lacustrine sediments, explaining locally the presence of H2S.

TI  - Small-scale Irrigation: The Driver for Promoting Agricultural Production and Food Security (The Case of Tigray Regional State, Northern Ethiopia)
PY  - 2015
AB  - Small-scale irrigation practices determine the level of food production and, to a great extent, the state of the food security. Considering its importance to the overall growth of the agriculture sector, the Government of Ethiopia gives special emphasis to enhance agricultural production through the promotion of small-scale irrigation schemes. This paper looks at the role of small-scale irrigation in promoting agricultural production and food security. It pays particular attention to the results of small-scale irrigation practices, issues that enhance or impede small-scale irrigation capacities and explore complementary strategies that enhance the development of small-scale irrigation. We use descriptive and regression analysis to examine the relationship between small-scale irrigation and agricultural production. Relying on a survey result and observations, we conclude that, small-scale irrigation schemes could significantly improve agricultural production and the status of food security.

TI  - Groundwater depletion will reduce cropping intensity in India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Groundwater depletion is becoming a global threat to food security, yet the ultimate impacts of depletion on agricultural production and the efficacy of available adaptation strategies remain poorly quantified. We use high-resolution satellite and census data from India, the world’s largest consumer of groundwater, to quantify the impacts of groundwater depletion on cropping intensity, a crucial driver of agricultural production. Our results suggest that, given current depletion trends, cropping intensity may decrease by 20% nationwide and by 68% in groundwater-depleted regions. Even if surface irrigation delivery is increased as a supply-side adaptation strategy, which is being widely promoted by the Indian government, cropping intensity will decrease, become more vulnerable to interannual rainfall variability, and become more spatially uneven. We find that groundwater and canal irrigation are not substitutable and that additional adaptation strategies will be necessary to maintain current levels of production in the face of groundwater depletion.

TI  - Cost–benefit and water resources policy: a survey
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper reviews recent developments in cost–benefit analysis for water policy researchers who wish to understand the applications of economic principles to inform emerging water policy debates. The cost–benefit framework can provide a comparison of total economic gains and losses resulting from a proposed water policy. Cost–benefit analysis can provide decision-makers with a comparison of the impacts of two or more water policy options using methods that are grounded in time-tested economic principles. Economic efficiency, measured as the difference between added benefits and added costs, can inform water managers and the public of the economic impacts of water programs to address peace, development, health, the environment, climate and poverty. Faced by limited resources, cost–benefit analysis can inform policy choices by summarizing trade-offs involved in designing, applying, or reviewing a wide range of water programs. The data required to conduct a cost–benefit analysis are often poor but the steps needed to carry out that analysis require posing the right questions.

TI  - Pros and cons of furrow irrigation on smallholdings in northeast Brazil
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Smallholder farming is the basis of agricultural production in developing regions. Irrigation improves the household livelihood and welfare of smallholders. Furrow irrigation is the most common type of irrigation on the small farms of public irrigation schemes set up in the Northeast of Brazil during the 1970s and 1980s. However, furrow irrigation triggers environmental problems related to deep percolation, runoff and soil erosion. The objective of this research was to determine how soil was lost from irrigation furrows as a result of their management and performance. Experiments were carried out in the Curu-Pentecoste irrigation scheme located in the state of Ceara, Brazil. Three inflow rates (corresponding to the three sizes of syphons used to apply water to the furrows) were compared on 60-m long furrows in the two predominant soil classes (sandy loam and silty clay loam) during 4 or 5 irrigation events throughout the irrigation season. Runoff represented between 20 and 70% of the water applied, carrying sediments amounting up to 2.8 Mg ha−1 in 4 irrigation events. Simple irrigation practices that could improve furrow irrigation performance in the scheme are suggested. However, the environmental problems of the furrow irrigation in practice seem inherent to the irrigation method used under those conditions. The paper discusses the adoption and performance of traditional and modern irrigation technology in smallholdings in developing regions.

TI  - Assessing the Representativeness of Irrigation Adoption Studies: A Meta-Study of Global Research
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>For decades, nations around the world have been promoting irrigation expansion as a method for improving agricultural growth, smoothing production risk, and alleviating rural poverty. Despite its apparent advantages, suboptimal adoption rates persist. According to the existing literature, determinants of irrigation adoption are often highly dependent on cultural, contextual, and/or local institutional factors. Yet, studies from diverse geographies identify a consistent set of factors. Thus, to be able to make generalizable inferences from such studies, a global geographic representativeness assessment of irrigation adoption studies was conducted to determine whether identified factors influencing irrigation were the result of geographic, epistemological, or disciplinary biases. The results indicate that multiple geographic biases exist with respect to studying farmers’ irrigation adoption decision-making. More research on this topic is being conducted in regions that have little to a high percentage of irrigation (&gt;1%), are readily accessible, receive moderate amounts of average annual rainfall, and have moderate amounts of cropland cover. The results suggest the need to expand research efforts in areas with little to no irrigation to identify constraints and help accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction, and food and livelihood security for rural communities in these regions.</jats:p>

TI  - Coupling technology with traditional knowledge and local institutions to deal with change in rural households: A focus on the semi-arid tropics
PY  - 2013
AB  - Contemporary industrial societies typically rely on engineering and technological means to control variability threatening food production or other aspects of survival. But before the advent of industrial mechanization and fuel-driven agriculture, societies had other types of adaptation strategies often oriented to spread risk across space (mobility), time (storage), asset classes (diversification), and households or communities (sharing and pooling). The storyline of this paper is that, for long stretches of history, and in many places still today, the effectiveness of the abovementioned risk-spreading strategies (and derived technologies) relied on coupling them with a) a deep knowledge of the local environment (traditional ecological knowledge); and b) a set of shared rules, norms and conventions on how to apply society’s technology and knowledge (locally evolved institutions). Drawing in our own research among different contemporary small-scale societies, we present one example of each of those strategies highlighting the role of traditional ecological knowledge and local institutions in the application of risk-spreading strategies and related technologies. In the last section, we discuss the role of traditional ecological knowledge and local institutions in dealing with change in the semi-arid tropics. We propose that attempts to increase the adaptive capacity of such social-ecological systems to deal with disturbances should make an effort to couple technological innovations with local knowledge of the environment and locally evolved institutions.

TI  - Impact of sugarcane irrigation on malaria vector Anopheles mosquito fauna, abundance and seasonality in Arjo-Didessa, Ethiopia
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite extensive irrigation development in Ethiopia, limited studies assessed the impact of irrigation on malaria vector mosquito composition, abundance and seasonality. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of sugarcane irrigation on species composition, abundance and seasonality of malaria vectors. Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps from three irrigated and three non-irrigated clusters in and around Arjo-Didessa sugarcane irrigation scheme in southwestern Ethiopia. Mosquitoes were surveyed in four seasons: two wet and two dry, in 2018 and 2019. Mosquito species composition, abundance and seasonality were compared between irrigated and non-irrigated clusters. Anopheles mosquitoes were sorted out to species using morphological keys and molecular techniques. Chi square was used to test the relationships between Anopheles species occurrence, and environmental and seasonal parameters. Overall, 2108 female Anopheles mosquitoes comprising of six species were collected. Of these, 92.7% (n = 1954) were from irrigated clusters and 7.3% (n = 154) from the non-irrigated. The Anopheles gambiae complex was the most abundant (67.3%) followed by Anopheles coustani complex (25.3%) and Anopheles pharoensis (5.7%). PCR-based identification revealed that 74.7% (n = 168) of the An. gambiae complex were Anopheles arabiensis and 22.7% (n = 51) Anopheles amharicus. The density of An. gambiae complex (both indoor and outdoor) was higher in irrigated than non-irrigated clusters. The overall anopheline mosquito abundance during the wet seasons (87.2%; n = 1837) was higher than the dry seasons (12.8%; n = 271). The ongoing sugarcane irrigation activities in Arjo-Didessa created conditions suitable for malaria transmitting Anopheles species diversity and abundance. This could drive malaria transmission in Arjo-Didessa and its environs in both dry and wet seasons. Currently practiced malaria vector interventions need to be strengthened by including larval source management to reduce vector abundance in the irrigated areas.

TI  - Stakeholders engagement at Magozi Rice Irrigation Scheme: Case study of moving from food-aid dependency to food self-sufficiency in Tanzania
PY  - 2018
AB  - This article examines stakeholders’ engagement in attaining food security and reducing poverty in the rural areas endowed with water natural resource. The main purpose of the article is to find evidence of appropriate approaches to overcome food insecurity and poverty in areas having abundant natural resources but engulfed with food and income poverty. It reviews the principles of stakeholders’ engagement to examine the extent to which Magozi village leadership applies in agricultural transformations. Data were collected using ethnographic techniques of key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and documentary review. Findings from the study show that Magozi village has moved from food-aid dependency to food self-sufficiency by engaging stakeholders in the entire process of problem definition (recurring hunger and poverty), planning, resource mobilization to implementation. The main finding is the success stories of moving from food-aid to food self-sufficiency attributed to the irrigation scheme that came as a result of engaging various stakeholders including the Anglican Church, Tanzania Social Action Fund, Local Government Authority, and the community. The article recommends the adoption and implementation of many irrigation schemes for transforming rural agriculture in Tanzania Key words: Food security, irrigation, poverty reduction, stakeholders’ engagement.

TI  - Agricultural water management and poverty in Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The main focus of this article is to explore whether access to selected agricultural water management (AWM) technologies has led to significant reduction in poverty and, if they did so, to identify which technologies had higher impacts. In measuring impact we estimated the average treatment effect for the treated on crop income and measured the differences in consumption expenditures per adult equivalent of those with access and without access using matched data. The estimated average treatment effect was significant and amounted to USD 82 per season. Moreover, there was 24 less poverty incidence among users of AWM technologies compared to nonusers. All technologies were found to have significant poverty reducing impacts with micro dams, deep wells, river diversions, and ponds leading to 37%, 26%, 11%, and 9% reduction in poverty incidence compared to rainfed system. Finally, our study identified the most important correlates of poverty on the basis this we made the policy recommendations to build assets (AWM technologies, livestock, etc); to enhance human resource development and improve the functioning of labor markets for enhanced impact of AWM technologies on poverty.

TI  - Innovative Water Resource Use and Management for Poverty Reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Anthology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Like in many parts of the world, water resources in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been pivotal for human survival, economic growth, social development, and practicing certain religion and cultural ethos. However, in spite of the intrinsic values of water, its use and management in sub-Saharan Africa has not been without limitations. The demand for water resources is increasing mainly due to rapid population growth, industrialization and urbanization and dealing with water-related issues has been complex and challenging for sustainable growth. Whilst there are various efforts by national governments, non-government organizations and communities to effectively and efficiently utilize and manage water resources, there are few comprehensive studies in sub- Saharan Africa that show the impact of the efforts on poverty reduction. Although certain reports indicate that many SSA countries lack clear vision on how water use can be harnessed with pro-poor growth and how poor communities can be capacitated to use water for poverty reduction, there are little exhaustive studies that clearly show familiar and innovative water use and management interventions followed by communities, national governments and other stakeholders, and demonstrate the challenges and successes of the same. Cognizant of the knowledge gap, in 2012 OSSREA launched a research project on ordinary and innovative water use and management patterns and practices in SSA, with a view to generate new knowledge on unexploited opportunities that could enhance the contribution of water resources to poverty reduction. This anthology documents various issues including water use and management in agriculture especially in irrigation projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe; water harvesting in Kenya and Uganda; the role of local water use institutions in Ethiopia; and water source maintenance and protection in Uganda.

TI  - Small-scale irrigation and household income linkage: Evidence from Deder district, Ethiopia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Investment in irrigation development is an important strategy in reducing risks associated with rainfall variability and achieving food security. This study examines the link between small-scale irrigation and household income. It also presents inherent institutional challenges in water allocation and the unintended outcomes. It used cross-sectional data obtained using a sample of 150 respondents selected through multi-stage sampling techniques from Deder district in eastern Ethiopia in 2009/2010 cropping year. The data were analyzed using Heckman-two step econometric models. The probit estimation shows that sex of the household head, access to credit and extension services have significant positive effect whereas the financial constraints restrains participation in irrigation water utilization. The ordinary least square using household income as outcome variable reveals that credit access, livestock holdings and proportion of land allocated to irrigation have significant positive effect on household income. This indicates that the more land is allocated to irrigation the higher will be the income. Moreover, the study pointed out that local institutional failure was a more important challenge than hydrological factors in managing the irrigation system. This has a policy implication in terms of strengthening the institutional environment. Key words: Deder, irrigation, income, Heckman model, institutions.

TI  - Can market-based approaches to technology development and dissemination benefit women smallholder farmers? A qualitative assessment of gender dynamics in the ownership, purchase, and use of irrigation pumps in Kenya and Tanzania
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rural household economies dependent on rainfed agriculture are increasingly turning to irrigation technology solutions to reduce the effects of weather variability and guard against inconsistent and low crop output. Organizations are increasingly using market-based approaches to disseminate technologies to smallholder farmers, and, although women are among their targeted group, little is known of the extent to which these approaches are reaching and benefiting women. There is also little evidence on the implications of women’s use and control of irrigation technologies for outcomes, including crop choice and income management. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study undertaken in Tanzania and Kenya to examine women’s access to and ownership of KickStart pumps and the implications for their ability to make major decisions on crop choices and use of income from irrigated crops. Results from sales-monitoring data show that women purchase less than 10 percent of the pumps and men continue to make most of the major decisions on crop choices and income use. These findings vary by type of crop, with men making major decisions on high-income crops such as tomatoes and women having relatively more autonomy on crops such as leafy vegetables. The study concludes that market-based approaches on their own cannot guarantee access to and ownership of technologies, and businesses need to take specific measures toward the goal of reaching and benefiting women.

TI  - Irrigation water pricing in Awash River Basin of Ethiopia: Evaluation of its impact on scheme-level irrigation performances and willingness to pay
PY  - 2015
AB  - Irrigation water pricing has been considered as a tool to enhance water conservation in irrigated agriculture. We have evaluated the effects of water pricing on water management practices in Awash Basin Authority (ABA). The water charge has been collected over years with the aim to generate money for the Awash Basin Authority to cover operational expenses. Both the authority and water users see the charges paid as the contribution than as water demand management tool. Widespread irrigation inefficiency and low performances are more due to low level of irrigator’s knowledge to manage water, poor water conveyance and distribution systems, public ownership over large and medium-scale irrigation schemes, and inability to measure and control water. Increasing water price under such service conditions will only add burden to farmers and unlikely to be feasible. Despite these poor water delivery services, users are willing to pay relatively more than they currently pay which could increase the income of the basin authority. Improvement in irrigation water management requires strengthening of irrigation research and extension services, building the capacity of irrigators, and improving irrigation system operation and maintenance services. Key words: Irrigation, water pricing, irrigation performance, willingness to pay.

TI  - Revitalisation of smallholder irrigation schemes for poverty alleviation and household food security in South Africa: A review
PY  - 2012
AB  - There seems to be a general consensus that improving agriculture and enhancing agricultural productivity through irrigation will remain a key strategy for rural poverty alleviation in most of the low income countries, where the majority of the rural poor depend directly or indirectly on agriculture. Nevertheless, Smallholder Irrigation Schemes (SIS) in South Africa have performed poorly and have not delivered on their development objectives of improving rural livelihoods through sustainable crop production for food security and poverty alleviation. For a long time, dilapidated irrigation infrastructure was viewed as the single major cause of the poor performance and the government invested huge sums of money towards repairing infrastructure. Consequently, research and expenditure tended to focus on irrigation infrastructure, but often this proved fruitless because the human capital was not developed to effectively utilise and maintain the infrastructure. Recent research, however, has identified weak institutional and organisational arrangements and poor technical skills of farmers as probably the major factors leading to underperformance of most SIS. It is therefore recommended that crop production approaches including farmer training be considered alongside all other issues during revitalisation of SIS to improve on performance. Key words: Farmer management skills, food security, institutional and organisational arrangements, poverty alleviation, revitalisation, smallholder irrigation schemes.

TI  - Estimating Efficiency of Public Investment in Irrigation at the State Level in India
PY  - 2021
AB  - An attempt is made to measure the relative efficiency of public investment in irrigation across major states in India from 1981–82 to 2015–16. We find a sizeable increase in public expenditure on irrigation and improvement in capital intensity in the last one decade. However, agriculture continues to receive a low priority in the public policy vis-a-vis its importance in the national economy. Also, an upturn in capital and revenue expenditure does not commensurate with an increase in the irrigation intensity, reflecting considerable inefficiencies. On an average, public canals have operated at about 59% technical efficiency in recent years, although levels vary widely from 9.6% in Andhra Pradesh to 100% each in Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. The inefficiency is largely due to capital expenditure, which needs to be utilised properly through faster completion of projects. Low efficiency scores may also suggest that public irrigation is not well placed, suggesting need for its better management and to explore potential for other sources of irrigation.

TI  - Exploring Synergies Between Hardware and Software Interventions on Water Savings in China: Farmers’ Response to Water Usage and Crop Production
PY  - 2012
AB  - Evidence is presented on synergies due to the sequencing and packaging of water reforms based on a review of case studies from the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) in the Yangtze River basin in China. Faced with strategic challenges of economic growth, food security, population growth, and climate change, China has implemented numerous hardware and software interventions in the water sector to increase the availability of water. These interventions—ranging from the provincial and system level to farm and field level—allow reallocation of water from agriculture to higher value uses, without significant reduction in crop production. This review of selected hardware and software interventions suggests that water sector reforms generate significant benefits for peasant farming communities and local governments. The review indicates that all agents respond to the same set of incentives simultaneously, by changing production and resource use decisions such that cumulative benefits from hardware and software interventions reinforce synergies. Synergies from reforms are evident, yet scaling up local collective actions for optimal impact is problematic. Heterogeneity in socioeconomic factors, as well as spatial differences, are the main stumbling blocks. Rewarding reformers seems to work, yet the benefits are neither immediate nor straight forward. Local implementation of national policies requires a systematic and coherent framework suited to the level of economic development of each region in order to achieve synergies from water reforms.

TI  - What factors determine household food security among smallholder farmers? Insights from Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACTFood insecurity persists in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Guidelines are required to inform the formulation of programmes dealing with this challenge. Literature identifies various factors, such as agricultural skills, as key determinants of household food security. This study examines linkages between agricultural skills and household food security in farming households of the Tugela Ferry irrigation scheme in the Msinga Local Municipality. Data was collected from a random sample of 250 farming households by means of a structured questionnaire. A Tobit regression model was employed to examine the determinants of household food security. The study found that factors like household size, marital status, education level, gender, total livestock units, household income, farming experience, credit use and competence levels in fertiliser measurement have the potential to reduce household food insecurity. The study concludes that provision of agricultural skills may improve households’ food securit...

TI  - Tuberculosis infection in wildlife from the Ruaha ecosystem Tanzania: implications for wildlife, domestic animals, and human health
PY  - 2013
AB  - Mycobacterium bovis, a pathogen of conservation, livestock, and public health concern, was detected in eight species of wildlife inhabiting protected areas bordering endemic livestock grazing lands. We tested tissues from 179 opportunistically sampled hunter-killed, depredation, road-killed, and live-captured wild animals, representing 30 species, in and adjacent to Ruaha National Park in south-central Tanzania. Tissue culture and PCR were used to detect 12 (8.1%) M. bovis-infected animals and 15 (10.1%) animals infected with non-tuberculosis complex mycobacteria. Kirk's dik-dik, vervet monkey, and yellow baboon were confirmed infected for the first time. The M. bovis spoligotype isolated from infected wildlife was identical to local livestock, providing evidence for livestock-wildlife pathogen transmission. Thus we advocate an ecosystem-based approach for bovine tuberculosis management that improves critical ecological functions in protected areas and grazing lands, reduces focal population density build-up along the edges of protected areas, and minimizes ecological stressors that increase animals' susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis.

TI  - Localising and sustaining poverty reduction: experiences from Ghana
PY  - 2009
AB  - Purpose – The aim of this paper is to examine poverty and poverty reduction at the local level using the Hohoe Municipality and Sefwi‐Wiaso District, both in Ghana, as a case.Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a survey method, collecting data from 180 farmers on the various aspects of the topic to form the basis of the study. Questionnaires and focus group discussions were used as the data collection instruments.Findings – The study found that, although many poverty reduction initiatives have been undertaken in Ghana, their impact on the poor farming communities has been very minimal. The failure of these poverty reduction policies could be attributed to the non‐involvement of local people in the process of policy formation. It also revealed that the number of poor people and the degree of poverty might be higher than the details captured by official statistics and publications.Research limitations/implications – The paper is biased towards farmers.

TI  - The economics of groundwater irrigation in the Indus Basin, Pakistan: tube-well adoption, technical and irrigation water efficiency and optimal allocation
PY  - 2015
AB  - The sustainability of agricultural growth has been greatly influenced by the massive use of groundwater in Pakistan for the last few decades. However, the groundwater economy of Pakistan is at a critical juncture. Concomitant with massive pumping of groundwater aquifers through unrestricted expansion of tube-wells, groundwater exploitation has led to many negative environmental, economic and spatial externalities and serious threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region. The spectacular increase in the groundwater development during the last half-century has manifested as a kind of “silent revolution” carried out by thousands of farmers in the pursuit of reliable irrigation water supplies. The groundwater revolution in the Indus basin has been a result of a succession of factors –each of which has exacerbated the groundwater crises in the subsequent periods. Initially, groundwater extraction was started to overcome waterlogging and salinity which was blown up by large scale surface water developments in coming years. Within this backdrop, this article attempts to identify the causes and consequences of groundwater overdrafting in Pakistan and draws attention to groundwater resource management issues. In this article, we discuss how the rigidity of the surface water allocation system (Warabandi), the Green Revolution, the Indus Water Treaty, soaring population and the ineffective groundwater management policies have led to the “groundwater revolution”. Major environmental externalities identified include soil salinization, salt water and sea water intrusions, land subsidence and drying up of lakes and vegetation in different parts of the country. Various pecuniary externalities such as increasing pumping costs and decreasing land values are also very prominent. Migration and prospective social conflicts are the potential spatial externalities. We find that decreasing surface water supplies, unimpeded extraction of groundwater through 7This chapter is accepted for publication as “Groundwater depletion in the Indus Plains of Pakistan: Imperatives, repercussions and management issues” in the Journal of International River Basin Management.

TI  - Local Perception of the Multifunctionality of Water Tanks in Two Villages of Tamil Nadu, South India
PY  - 2011
AB  - Using data from free listings and a survey in two villages of Tamil Nadu, India, we discuss local perceptions and uses of water tanks, a traditional irrigation infrastructure. We hypothesize that both farmers and nonfarmers perceive and use water tanks for purposes other than irrigation. We found that informants recognized the importance of water tanks for irrigation, but also acknowledged other socioeconomic uses and ecological functions. Marginal sectors (i.e., Scheduled Castes) use tank resources in more diverse ways than other sectors of the population. Findings are relevant for development. International organizations working on the revival of water tanks aim to transfer water management to farmers for the purpose of irrigation. By recognizing that tanks benefit people other than farmers and in ways other than providing irrigation water, organizations working on tank rejuvenation could achieve a more equitable management of tank resources.

TI  - The impact of selected small-scale irrigation schemes on household income and the likelihood of poverty in the Lake Tana basin of Ethiopia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Poverty reduction has been largely a result of economic growth. The economic growth and extent of poverty in Ethiopia are determined primarily by the growth of agriculture because agriculture is the largest component of the economy. One of the major factors behind the weak performance of Ethiopian agriculture is lack of adequate rainfall, combined with variability in the onset and duration of rainfall. Irrigation development is one approach to address this problem, and it has been given significant attention in economic development programs in the country. This study examines the impact of selected small-scale irrigation schemes on crops grown, total income, and the likelihood of poverty at household level for a particular region. A survey of 180 randomly-selected household heads, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were undertaken in Fogera District, Tana basin, Ethiopia to assess irrigation impacts. Descriptive statistics and econometric modeling were used to assess the impacts of irrigation on household income and the likelihood of a household being classified as poor. The research reported herein had five major objectives. The first objective was to identify the major field crops and vegetables grown using small-scale irrigation in the study area. The main field crops grown using small-scale irrigation schemes in the study region are maize, oat, rice and vetch and the dominant vegetables are onion, tomato, potato and pepper. Onion production was the most important source of income from crops grown with irrigation. The second objective was to compare the relative advantages of four types of small-scale irrigation system, with emphasis on household gross income. Farmers using concrete canal river/spring diversion had higher mean cropping income per household on average than other irrigation types. Statistically significant differences were found between the household concrete canal river/spring diversion and traditional river diversion and pedal pump irrigation systems, but no significant difference exists between concrete river/spring diversion and motor pump, nor between traditional river diversion and pedal pump. Households using any of the four irrigation systems had statistically significantly higher mean gross household income than households not using irrigation. A third objective was to estimate the marginal impact of small-scale irrigation on gross household income controlling for other important factors that affect income. A censored regression model developed for this objective indicated that access to small–scale irrigation increased mean annual household income significantly (about ETB 3,353 per year, or a 27 % increase over non-irrigating households). The fourth objective of this research was to assess the impact of irrigation access on the likelihood of poverty. Descriptive analysis suggested that irrigating households had a lower probability of being poor than non-irrigating households: of households in the lowest quartile of income, only 12% were irrigating households and the remaining 88 % did not irrigate. A Logit regression model developed to assess the impact of irrigation on the likelihood of poverty controlling for other factors indicated that access to irrigation significantly reduced the odds that a household would be in the lowest quartile of household income, the key poverty threshold used in this study. A final objective was to examine the major problems encountered in the use of the small-scale irrigation systems. These were identified by farmers and development agents as: lack of access to surface water, loss of water through seepage, problem of irrigation water distribution, lack of spare parts for water pumps, high cost of fuel for water pumps, lack of market transparency and marketing facilities, crop disease, and the perceived high cost of inputs.

TI  - A remote sensing-based irrigation performance assessment: a case study of the Office du Niger in Mali
PY  - 2009
AB  - The irrigation performance of the Office du Niger in Mali, a large-scale rice-based irrigation scheme, was analysed with the use of remote sensing technology. The major advantage of remote sensing derived data over field measured data is that it provides system-wide, spatially distributed and objective information. Four irrigation performance indicators, entirely based on remote sensing, were applied at different organisational levels of the system. The surface energy balance algorithm for land model was applied to high-resolution Landsat images to calculate rice production and water consumption spatially. These maps were used to analyse the productivity of water, the uniformity of water consumption and head-/tail-enders issues at the level of the system, the five administrative zones and smaller management units (casiers). The sustainability of the system was assessed using a long-term time series of the normalised difference vegetation index. The results were discussed and interpreted with the irrigation managers of the Office du Niger. The analysis provided new insights in the performance of the system such as existing head–tail patterns in water consumption and rice yields.

TI  - The contribution of small-scale rural irrigation schemes towards food security of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Smallholder farmers across Zimbabwe have been facing a problem of food insecurity because of climate-induced droughts and lack of effective use of irrigation schemes. Rainfall patterns in the country have become more unpredictable and inconsistent with the traditional farming seasons. Faced with such challenges, many smallholder farmers in Shurugwi district in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe adopted small-scale irrigation schemes to improve food security. The principal objectives of this study were to examine the status of the irrigation schemes in the district; analyse the need to rehabilitate small-scale irrigation schemes; assess the initiatives towards the revival of irrigation schemes; establish the benefits that can accrue to smallholder farmers from small-scale irrigation schemes and discuss challenges faced by smallholder farmers in the running of small-scale irrigation schemes in rural areas. This qualitative study employed literature and interviews to obtain data from 40 purposively selected participants. The direct observation method was used to compliment the interviews. The findings of the study were that small-scale rural irrigation schemes have the capacity to significantly transform the lives of rural farmers through earning increased reliable income from farming if institutional and capacity issues of the farmers are addressed. Furthermore, the study found that small-scale irrigation schemes can also be a panacea to food security challenges mainly faced by rural households. As such, the article concluded that irrigation schemes are fortress and antidote to the effects of climate change. The study calls for capacity promotion on technical skills for the farmers, the establishment of many new irrigation schemes and the rehabilitation of the existing small-scale irrigation schemes in the country as well as calling on the farmers to adopt climate-smart irrigation.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases associated with the use of contaminanted water in households lacking drinking water and sanitation in the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo. Methodology: Data from the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey was used. A binomial logistic model was developed which considered sociodemographic variables as well as others related to the sources of water supply and sanitation in households. Results: There are statistically significant differences in the probability of becoming infected with a disease depending on the origin of the water source that reaches households, its frequency as well as lack of drainage and direct discharge in the toilet. Limitations: The results are representative of the region but not of each municipality that integrate it. Main findings: Lack of basic services and access to drinking water increase the probability of gastrointestinal events in households in the Mezquital Valley. The implementation of public policy strategies in terms of coverage of basic services is recommended as well as water treatment programs that minimize the effects on health due to domestic use.

TI  - Development and Sustainability of Rural Economy of Pakistan through Local Community Support for CPEC
PY  - 2021
AB  - This paper investigates the local community support for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) using the lens of social exchange theory. The study examines the direct effect of social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors on the local community support for CPEC projects, and the resultant impacts on the development and sustainability of the rural economy of Pakistan. The study also explores the moderation effect of media influence on shaping positive perceptions of CPEC among the local populace. The local communities at the CPEC route which are affected or can be affected by the project were targeted for data collection using a structured questionnaire. The collected valid data (N = 259) were thoroughly analyzed by obtaining reliability and validity statistics, a correlation matrix, multiple regression, moderation analysis, and hypotheses testing. Our results substantiate that the local community support for the CPEC project is heavily dependent on social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors and that there is a positive influence of media impact as an opinion-maker in the local community regarding the CPEC. The CPEC is expected to develop the rural economy, particularly through improvements in agriculture and allied activities, thereby providing livelihoods and income-generating opportunities to the rural masses. The article is important for regulators, the CPEC authority, government bodies, and the relevant community.

TI  - FOOD SECURITY IN THE UPPER EAST REGION OF GHANA: A SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
PY  - 2015
AB  - Despite significant progress made by the government of Ghana in recent times in reducing poverty incidence in rural areas of the country there still remain some challenges in food access, use and availability. The experience of less developed countries shows that food security has often been negatively affected by climate variability, natural disasters and socio-political instability. The main research question is whether or not poverty reduction always brings about increased food security. This paper examines the food situation in the Upper East Region of Ghana with respect to both irrigated and non-irrigated smallholder farmers with focus on food sources and causes of food insecurity and food insecurity coping strategies. Results of in-depth interviews and desk studies reveal that poverty reduction is not always accompanied by increased food security. However, increased access to agricultural water through small-scale irrigation schemes has a positive impact on the food security status of rural households. Irrigation farmers’ inability to expand their farming ventures is due to a number of constraints, prominent among them are difficulty in securing credit to buy inputs such as seeds, fertilizer and agro-chemicals; high disease infestation of irrigated crops (eg nematodes) and poor maintenance of the schemes. The policy implication is that increased access to food security requires the joint support of government, civil society organisations (NGOs) and the private sector.

Thus, the understanding of rural population density becomes an important issue to be studied. Approach: Using the rural settled areas of Shaqlawa District as a case study, this study seeks to reveal the specific importance of rural population density as an important variable in understanding the socioeconomic characteristics of sparsely settled rural regions, where spares and falling density presents practical and conceptual problems for rural planners. Results and Conclusion: It is obvious that the need of rural areas for socioeconomic development and regeneration along with the need for diversification of their economic base so as to meet the changes is today greater than ever. The motivation behind of this project is based on the fact that during the last few decades the rural settlement in the study area has been dramatically changed. However at the same time there is a realization that certain parts of the rural area have been left behind in development and the authority is currently promoting rural area in order to sustain local economies and to enhance employment and growth.

TI  - Estimating the impact of agricultural technology on poverty reduction in rural Nigeria.
PY  - 2009
AB  - "It has often been argued that new agricultural technologies lead to poverty reduction. This paper argues that any changes in poverty situation attributed to those who adopt new agricultural technology (treatment group) without a counterfactual comparison of carefully selected nonadopters (control group) are likely to be questionable. The paper estimates the effects of new agricultural technology on poverty reduction by employing the “double difference” method on data collected in rural Nigeria. Seeing the agricultural technology–poverty linkage through the lenses of adopters and nonadopters of such new technology provides understanding of the relationship between agricultural technology and poverty. The paper finds that differences in poverty status between adopters and nonadopters of new agricultural technologies (a combination of tube wells and pumps) introduced in rural Nigeria in the late 1980s and early 1990s are alarmingly modest. The paper concludes that new agricultural technology would not expressly lead to poverty reduction in poor countries. The exact channels through which new agricultural technology impact poverty outcomes need to be further explored." from authors' abstract

TI  - Inter Linkages of Water, Climate, and Agriculture
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:p>Climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity and evidence shows possibility of shifts in earth's climate. Concern over the potential effects of long-term climatic change on agriculture has been raised over the past decade. Change in the climatic conditions on the globe created threat to the availability water for agriculture production. The present chapter is an attempt to distil what is known about the likely effects of climate change on water availability to agriculture for food security and nutrition in coming decades. Apart from few exceptions, the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture water resources in the future are not understood in any great depth. There are many uncertainties as to how changes in various environmental parameters will interact with the availability of water and further agriculture production. The future consequences of water resources on agriculture are discussed and summarized. Possible mitigation and adaptations to changing water availability for agriculture are also discusses.</jats:p>

TI  - Profitability Analysis of Small Scale Irrigation Technology Adoption to Farmers in Nasho Sector, Rwanda
PY  - 2020
AB  - The study aims to assess the effect of small scale irrigation adoption to farmers in Nasho sector, Kirehe District in Rwanda. The average yield was 12,309.73 Kg/2.62 ha or 4698.73 Kg/ha for adopters with the mean difference between adopters and non adopters ranged from 2819.63 Kg to 4766.59 Kg per unit area of production. For food security status, the average mean quantity of maize consumed at home level was 615.54 Kg with the mean difference ranged from 377.29 Kg to 474.68 Kg. For market participation, the average treatment effect of the treated (ATT) of quantity of maize sold was 11,694.24 Kg while the mean difference ranged from 7165.98 Kg to 9015.60 Kg. The Average Treatment Effect of the Treated market price was 213 Frws/Kg while the mean difference ranged from 44.51 Frws/Kg to 48.3053 Frws/Kg. The Average Treatment Effect of the Treated of farmer’s revenues for the users was 938,772 Frws/ha, however, the mean difference between adopters and non adopters ranged from 1,732,942 Frws to 2,007,039 Frws. The Average Treatment Effect of the Treated of farmer’s net farm income was 1,066,393 Frws while mean difference between users and non users ranged from 803,967 Frws to 854,141 Frws. For profitability analysis, the cost benefit ratio (CBR) was taken into account. The total benefit per unit area was 2,434,509 Frws and total average mean cost of 1,382,313 Frws and CBR = 1.761 > 1. The findings of this study will help the policy makers for deeper sector planning and also, it will facilitate other stakeholders to invest in irrigation technology to improve the livelihoods of Rwandan farmers and other surroundings.

TI  - Assessing Performance of Small‐Scale Pumped Irrigation Systems in sub‐Saharan Africa: Evidence from a Systematic Review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Small-scale irrigation (SSI) has significant potential to increase crop productivity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Pumped irrigation systems are one of the technologies increasingly being used by smallholder farmers. The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the performance of SSI pumped systems, including motorized, treadle, rope and washer, solar and wind pumps. The study revealed a lack of standardization and use of a wide range of indicators to assess performance. Most evidence related to motorized pumps, and these studies confirmed mixed levels of performance; studies relating to other types of pumped system mostly reported a positive impact, although the method of assessment used was critical. Studies reporting positive impacts tended to be those that used socio-economic based factors such as yield and profitability, whereas studies reporting mixed performance tended to be those that relied more on technically based indicators such as pumping and irrigation system efficiency. The analysis highlights the sensitivity of interpreting findings from different studies, and how caution should be exercised when comparing performance within and between different types of irrigation systems. The implications for supporting policy development and identifying future research gaps are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - HOW DOES UNEQUAL ACCESS TO GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTE TO MARGINALIZATION OF SMALL FARMERS? THE CASE OF PUBLIC LANDS IN ALGERIA†
PY  - 2012
AB  - L'usage de l'eau souterraine en agriculture irriguee est souvent considere comme un facteur d'augmentation de la productivite des agriculteurs. Mais les effets de l'acces differencie a l'eau souterraine ont rarement ete etudies a l'echelle micro-economique et notamment sur d'eventuels effets pervers de marginalisation des petits agriculteurs. Durant la crise hydraulique qui touche les perimetres d'irrigation en Algerie depuis les annees 1980, l'eau souterraine est devenue la principale ressource d'irrigation des exploitations agricoles. Un processus de differenciation d'exploitations agricoles en lien avec l'acces a l'eau souterraine a ete enclenche et a entraine des problemes d'equite sociale. Dans l'objectif de comprendre la differenciation des exploitations agricoles dans le perimetre d'irrigation de Ouarizane, nous avons adopte dans un premier temps une approche d'enquetes historiques. Dans un deuxieme temps, nous avons mobilise une approche de prospective participative afin d'analyser les trajectoires d'evolution des exploitations agricoles dans un contexte d'adoption d'une nouvelle loi fonciere. Nos resultats confirment le role structurel de l'acces a l'eau souterraine dans la differenciation des exploitations agricoles et dans le processus de concentration fonciere dans les perimetres d'irrigation. Les tendances vers la concentration fonciere et la marginalisation des petits agriculteurs vont probablement s'accentuer apres l'application de la nouvelle loi fonciere. (Resume d'auteur)

TI  - Measuring Production and Irrigation Efficiencies of Rice Farms: Evidence from the Punjab Province, Pakistan
PY  - 2014
AB  - We employ a non-parametric approach, data envelopment analysis, to estimate the technical and irrigation efficiency of rice farms in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. We use a cross-sectional dataset of 80 rice growers, including 45 tube-well owners and 35 water buyers. Mean technical efficiency scores show that tube-well owners and water buyers are operating at fairly high efficiency levels, indicating that access to technology is not a major constraint. However, irrigation inefficiency is pronounced, with water buyers being more inefficient than tube-well owners. A bootstrap truncated regression is used to investigate the determinants of technical and irrigation efficiency. We suggest that groundwater management policies should be designed to address efficiency enhancing factors such as knowledge of crop water consumption requirement, better credit opportunities, outreach extension services and training programs.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation and Income Distribution in Ethiopia
PY  - 2006
AB  - Irrigation stimulates agricultural productivity and economic growth, but this may come at the cost of growing inequality. Using data at community and household level, this paper analyzes the distributional impacts of irrigation in Ethiopia. Regression analyses reveal the direct effects of irrigation on expenditures and labour demand, and the indirect effects of irrigation on food prices and expenditures of non-irrigation households. The results indicate that past development of irrigation stimulated growth without deepening inequality, and that irrigation decreased dependence on food-for-work programs. Thus, irrigation has played a positive role in the development of Ethiopia.

TI  - The Role of Optimizing Agricultural Water Resource Management to livelihood Poverty abolition in Rural Iran
PY  - 2009
AB  - Most of the projected increase in global population will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. As a vital agricultural resource, irrigation water is important for the productivity of a society and the livelihood of its members. With a common belief in the important role of irrigation in agricultural development, many developing Asian countries have promoted irrigation development over recent decades. These efforts have sought to achieve such broad objectives as economic growth, rural and agricultural development, food security, and protection against adverse drought conditions, with all of these goals expected to contribute to improved social outcomes. Through these benefits, irrigation water is linked to poverty alleviation, both directly and indirectly. This study examines agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction. In addition, this study aims to empower water users with information on agricultural wastewater.

TI  - Viewpoint: Water, agriculture & poverty in an era of climate change: Why do we know so little?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Understanding the complex relationship between water, agriculture and poverty (WAP) is essential for informed policy-making in light of increasing demand for scarce water resources and greater climatic variability. Yet, our understanding of the WAP nexus remains surprisingly undeveloped and dispersed across multiple disciplines due to conceptual (biophysical and economic) and measurement issues. We argue that water for agriculture will need to be better managed for it to contribute to reductions in poverty and vulnerabilities. Moreover, this management will need to consider not just quantities of water, but the quality of the water and the multiple agricultural and non-agricultural uses. For this reason, expanding research in WAP needs to involve interdisciplinary efforts. We identify three key knowledge gaps in WAP that are particularly pressing in light of greater climatic variability. These are climate change adaptation, over-abstraction of groundwater, and water quality.

TI  - Are Irrigation Rehabilitation Projects Good For Poor Farmers In Peru? - Are irrigation rehabilitation projects good for poor farmers in Peru
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper analyzes changes in agricultural production and economic welfare of farmers in rural Peru resulting from a large irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation project. The analysis uses a ten-year district panel and a spatial regression discontinuity approach to measure the causal effect of the intervention. While general impacts are modest, the analysis shows that the project is progressive--poor farmers consistently benefit more than non-poor farmers. Farmers living in districts with a rehabilitated irrigation site experience positive labor dynamics, in terms of income and agricultural jobs. Poor farmers increase their total income by more than $220 per year compared with the control group, while rich farmers do not experience such an income gain. The results also show crop specialization patterns in the economic status of farm households; poorer farm households increase their production of staple crops, such as beans and potatoes, while non-poor beneficiary farmers cultivate more industrial crops. Findings from this evaluation have important implications for pro-poor policy design in the agricultural sector.

TI  - The Reticulation Irrigation Scheme at Sankana, Upper West Region, Ghana: Current Usage, Productivity and Incomes
PY  - 2015
AB  - In 1961, the Ghana Government constructed a reticulation irrigation scheme at Sankana in the then Upper Region (now Upper West Region) with a potential irrigation area of 120 hectares, a 750 m wall length and a 25 m spillway weight to boost arable farming and inland fishing. A little over 50 years on, the present case study assesses usage, productivity and incomes resulting from the irrigation project. In June 2014, farmers’ patronage of the irrigation water was investigated through the use of an interview guide, a questionnaire, a group discussion guide supported by key informant interviews with officials of relevant state institutions, transect walks and personal observation. At present, only 73 farmers depend on the stored water for irrigation of crops; 55 farmers were available for questioning; and there were nineteen fish farmers. For a farming season, the majority of farmers (58%) earn incomes between GH¢150.00 and 300.00, and on the scale of stable, moderate and unstable, 67% of farmers consider incomes to be moderately reliable. Moreover, less than 50% of the farmers utilizing the irrigation project are food secure. Also, 35% of participating farmers are involved in fishing and farming at the same time benefitting from the dual objective of the project. The study concludes that the reticulation irrigation scheme at Sankana is underutilized. Keywords: Reticulation, irrigation, usage, productivity, income, Sankana

TI  - Economic Performance of Small Scale Private Irrigation Scheme: A Case Study of the Tin Mining Ponds of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria
PY  - 2014
AB  - Increasing the crop water productivity in smallholder farming is important since the productivity is often low but has the largest potential to be enhanced. In Nigeria, tomato and pepper forms a very important component of many households' diet. Their production is mainly a smallholder activity characterized with low productivity compared to the world average. In explaining the low productivities of the farmers, it is necessary to look into the profitability of their farm enterprise to show the close links existing between productivity and farm income. This study estimates the profitability of tomato and pepper production using the gross margin analysis to determine the farm income on smallholder farms of tin mining ponds of the Jos-Plateau. Empirical result indicates that tomato and pepper production are profitable. The average rate of return to a naira invested in tomato and pepper production were N0.87k and N1.49 respectively. To fully tap the potential of increase productivity and farm income, the study recommends that expanded access to improved technologies for tomato and pepper production should be extended to the farmers through extension services. Implications for policy are discussed.

TI  - Impact of Irrigation Technologies on Rural Households’ Poverty Status: the Case of Fogera District, North-Western Ethiopia
PY  - NA
AB  - This study tries to analyze whether irrigation technologies have reduced the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty in Fogera district of the Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia. It also assesses the possible impact brought about by irrigation technologies on households’ per capita consumption expenditure. Foster- Greer-Thorbeck (FGT) index and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) were used for analyzing the data collected from 180 farm households through formal survey techniques. The result indicated that annual per capita consumption expenditure of irrigation technology users is better than that of non-users. Among the different irrigation technology user groups, per capita consumption expenditure of diversion irrigation users is higher followed by that of motor pump users and treadle pump users in that order. Results from FGT index showed that users of different irrigation technologies are in a better position in terms of incidence, depth, and severity of poverty as compared to the non-users group. The PSM result also indicated that irrigation has increased per capita consumption expenditure of user households by 21 percent. It is, therefore, necessary to develop small-scale irrigation technologies and to encourage farm households to use the technologies in order to reduce poverty.

TI  - The impact of smallholder irrigation on household welfare: The case of Tugela Ferry irrigation scheme in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - The potential of smallholder irrigated agriculture to enhance food security and alleviate rural poverty has led the South African Government to prioritise and invest significantly in irrigation establishment, rehabilitation and revitalisation. The question addressed in this study pertains to the extent to which smallholder irrigation has been able to reduce poverty in the rural communities to justify this investment. Using a sample of 251 farmers, this study found that factors such as land size, perceived soil fertility, household size, and access to support services were significant predictors of irrigation participation. The results from the treatment effect model indicated that access to irrigation plays a positive role in the welfare of rural households, with irrigators spending about ZAR2 000 per adult equivalent on consumption more than the non-irrigators. The study, therefore, concluded that government investments in smallholder irrigation for poverty reduction are justified. The other factors that influenced household consumption were off-farm income, land size, livestock size, education level, family size and access to support services and infrastructure. The study recommends that investments in smallholder irrigation continue for poverty reduction, and that priority should also be on finding other feasible rural micro-projects and development initiatives to complement smallholder irrigation and significantly reduce rural poverty.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges of Small-Scale Irrigation And Its Implications For Livelihood Improvement: (The Case Of Tigray Regional State, Northern Ethiopia)
PY  - 2015
AB  - The paper examines the challenges and opportunities of small-scale irrigation schemes in northern Ethiopia, with the view of strengthening their significance in improving rural livelihoods in Tigray region. It adopts quantitative and qualitative research approach. A total of 100 respondents from three weredas were involved in the survey. When the Pearson relationship of the different independent variables is seen in relation to agricultural production, factors such as investment and construction of ponds, investment in purchase of inputs, investment in purchase of pumps, total irrigated land in ha and revenue from agricultural products are playing an important role in promoting agricultural production and there is positive and significant relationship to agricultural production. The research result also identified that the problems of small-scale irrigations as shortage of agricultural inputs specially improved seed and pesticides, financial constraints especially for the purchase of motor pumps, high cost of irrigation, shortage of water pump technologies, spare parts and gabions, technical problems such as maintenance of motor pumps, insufficient market information and market networks, shortage of ponds and diversion, infrastructure specially road and storage, theft of fruits, diseases and pests. The result of the research also indicates that there is potential for the development of small-scale irrigation specially water, land and labour. In conclusion, if small-scale irrigation schemes are to play their role, an integrated effort of all development partners such as government (specifically Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development, Woreda Office of Agriculture and Rural Development), cooperative promoters, microfinance institutions, private banks, donor agencies, private sector and the society at large is crucial to address the aforementioned problems faced by farmers. Moreover, farmers should establish viable and strong linkages with development /extension agents and other cooperative societies in the areas of irrigation, agricultural production, finance, marketing and technology adoption.

TI  - Rural households livelihoods ' strategies and opportunities with regard to farming :a case of Intsika Yethu Local Municipality.
PY  - 2013
AB  - South Africa and other developing countries are grappling with high levels of poverty as a result of slow to negligible rural development. Irrigation development is one essential component that can be used to address the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in rural areas. In the President‟s “State of the Nation Address” in 2011, the President of South Africa outlined measures to reduce hunger and poverty in communal areas through enhanced government‟s expenditures in rural infrastructure developments, especially for such amenities as irrigation and roads, with a view to promoting food security. The broad objective of this study is to assess livelihood strategies and opportunities with regard to farming in Qamata area of Intsika Yethu Local Municipality. The stratified random sampling method was applied in order to choose a sample of 70 household that were interviewed by means of semi-structured questionnaires. Out of these, 53 belonged to the irrigation project and 17 farmers were non-irrigation farmers. The results show that women play an active role in agriculture. The Multiple Regression model was used to assess the relative importance of different livelihood strategies adopted by both irrigation and non-irrigation farmers in improving household food security and welfare in Qamata. More specifically, the study assessed the impact of different livelihood strategies on production of butternut, goats, maize and poultry (Chicken) in Qamata. The results show increased agricultural production, crop diversification and higher incomes from irrigation farming as compared to dry land farming. Irrigation farming has enabled many households to diversify their sources of income and therefore include activities and enterprises that contribute to enhanced household welfare. The study showed that household size is crucial in crop production, followed by gender of the household head. The government and research institutes need to come up with programmes to train people on ways to produce crop and livestock products more efficiently.

TI  - IMPACT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ON PROFIT EFFICIENCY OF VEGETABLE FARMING IN WEST JAVA, INDONESIA: STOCHASTIC FRONTIER APPROACH
PY  - 2014
AB  - Infrastructure plays an important role in increasing farm profit, since it reduces transaction costs which affect input and output price. The vegetable farming profit is relatively high although it varies, due to different infrastructure conditions. The study was conducted to analyze the level of profit efficiency due to various infrastructure conditions and to reveal the determinants of vegetable farming profit. The research was conducted in West Java, Indonesia with 192 sample farming activities. The results indicate that vegetable farming was not yet efficient, with an efficiency level of 0.53, and around 70 percent of farming activities having an efficiency level below 0.7. Factors that influenced significantly profit were seed price, chemical fertilizers, wage, and non-land capital formation. The increase of crop diversification, land conservation technology, seed technology, number of credit, farmer’s education, and market access to input market are very effective in increasing vegetable farming profit efficiency.

TI  - Water budgeting in major rabi crops under surface irrigation in Western Indo-Gangetic Plains
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>A water budget confers the relationship between input, output and changes in the amount of water at an individual farm level to the watershed level depending upon point of interest. Basic components of water budgets are precipitation, evapotranspiration, change in soil moisture storage, deep percolation and runoff. However, non-availability of water balance parameter is the main problem for achieving the more crop per drop. Therefore, the current study was undertaken at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi farm (Mid-block, MB) during rabi 2016-17 to study the water budget of different major rabi crops (wheat, mustard, chickpea) under surface irrigation. Water budget components like soil moisture were measured by gravimetric method periodically, and daily crop-evapotranspiration (ETc) and stage-wise effective rainfall (Pe) for the test crops were estimated using FAO-CROPWAT- 8.0 model. Irrigation scheduling was done on the basis of soil moisture depletion method and total volume of water applied measured through star flow meter. The total volume of irrigation water applied during the entire crop period was 337.75, 211.54 mm and 182.90 mm, for wheat, mustard and chickpea, respectively. The results revealed that both in late- and timely - sown mustard (MB-3A-1 and 3A-2), chickpea (MB-9-A) and wheat crops (MB-3A-3, 6-A and 12-A), the highest ETc was recorded during mid-season stage (i.e. 82.90, 79.50, 94.07, 126.04, 114.02, 132.61 mm, respectively). The deep- percolation losses varied from 29.3-31.8 % for sandy loam soil to 40.2-42.2 % for clay loam soil under different crops due to larger amount of irrigation water applied in clay soil. These water budgeting parameters are location and crop specific and so to be estimated for crops, seasons and regions.</jats:p>

TI  - Water management in India: the multiplicity of views and solutions
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractThere is very limited scientific evidence to support some of the ideas in the water sector that guide India’s government policies in these sectors. Further, the interdisciplinary perspective required for the design of economic instruments, institutions, and laws and regulations to implement existing policies is lacking in social scientists. This article discusses the growing debate on water management options for India, the tone and tenor of policy debate and the inconsistency. It summarizes 10 scholarly articles from various authors which reflect the multiplicity of views on water issues and solutions for water management in the country.

TI  - Planning and management of irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa: reducing the environmental and health costs
PY  - NA
AB  - Development of irrigation can result in negative environmental and human health impacts. Irrigation undertaken without full consideration of these impacts can have serious adverse repercussions, not only undermining the investment but also worsening poverty and contributing considerably to peoples\u2019 suffering. The impacts are strongly inter-linked because it is changes in the environment that cause changes in health. Furthermore, mitigation measures that reduce environmental damage often improve health outcomes. In the past, research into impacts, and the development of impact assessment methodologies, has focused primarily on large scale, capital intensive, schemes. However, small scale and less formal water management interventions, which are increasingly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, can also have significant environmental and health impacts. This paper summarizes the findings of a study of environmental and health issues associated with all scales of irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. It is not a compendium of data, but rather provides an overview and framework for understanding policy and programming issues. It is recommended that a pragmatic approach to address current environmental and health planning includes three levels of implementation: i) strategic planning at the national and regional level; ii) full environmental and health assessment for government and donor funded projects; and iii) development of simplified tools for impact assessment relevant to community led, NGO and small private projects.

TI  - Links between Irrigation, Agriculture and Level of Living
PY  - 2011
AB  - Present study analyse irrigation, agriculture and level of living in the districts of Orissa. District wise scenario of irrigation, agriculture and living standard were revealed with the help of different indexes developed for the study, which are groundwater development index, irrigation coverage index, composite irrigation index, agricultural development index,Level of living index and poverty ration index. Balasore, Bargarh, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Ganjam, Jajpur and Puri districts show higher irrigation and agriculture development. While Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Kandhamal, Malkangiri, Nawapara, Raygarh and Sundargarh districts show lower irrigation and agriculture development. Groundwater development index values of 25 districts are found low to very low. Half of the districts show medium agricultural development index values; while level of living is found at medium level in majority of the districts. About 60% of rural families below poverty line comprise of agricultural labourers, marginal and small farmers. The study delineated the links and/or missing links between irrigation resources, agriculture development, poverty and level of living in the districts of Orissa, which is understood through a correlation matrix. Agricultural development index is significantly related with composite irrigation index, while level of living is significantly related with irrigation, agriculture and poverty indices. The regression analyses revealed that 71% variation in agricultural development index is explained by composite irrigation index.

TI  - An Analysis of Rural Poverty in Irrigated and Un-irrigated Areas: Micro Level Study
PY  - 2014
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyse variation rural poverty in irrigated and un-irrigated areas. Therefore, primary data was collected during 2013 - 14 (December - April) from the villages of Tamil Nadu state using simple random techniques. Descriptive analysis was carried out for the study. The results of the study demonstrated that employment days, income and consumptions of the households are higher in irrigated villages whereas less in un-irrigated village. Additionally, the number of household below poverty line (NHHBPL) and number of population below poverty line (NPBPL) are higher in un-irrigated village as compared to irrigated villages. Further, percentage of household below poverty line (PHHBPL) and percentage of population below poverty line (PPBPL) are identified more in un-irrigated village than irrigated villages. This shows that poverty level is higher in un-irrigated village and lower in irrigated villages which are expected in this study. The study also pointed out that irrigation is the crucial factor in alleviating poverty.

TI  - The Livelihoods Impacts of Irrigation in Western Africa: The Ghana Experience
PY  - 2021
AB  - Although agriculture remains the mainstay of the African economy, it is currently going through stress because of a multitude of factors including climate change. Thus, many countries in their efforts to transform their agricultural sectors are employing climate-smart initiatives including the provision of water harvesting technologies for irrigated crop production during the dry season. This paper examines the role of irrigation in the drive towards a transformation of smallholder agriculture in Africa. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews and individual questionnaires were employed for the data collection. The data were analyzed using the regression adjustment (RA) technique. The results indicate that irrigation has significant and positive impacts on farm incomes, employment, consumption, food security and non-farm businesses, all of which are necessary conditions for a successful transformation of smallholder agriculture in Africa. The impacts of irrigation on health and environmental sustainability are mixed—the positive being the ability of irrigators to pay for improved healthcare for their families and the negatives include the outbreak of waterborne diseases associated with irrigation water. Construction of irrigation facilities causes destruction to the environment but improves provisioning ecosystem services. It is generally concluded that access to irrigation is associated with higher farm incomes, employment, consumption, food security and engagement in non-farm business activities. The key policy implication of these findings is that African governments must formulate strategic policies that will accelerate investments in the provision of irrigation facilities to better promote the agenda to transform smallholder agriculture in the continent.

TI  - Why Study Sustainable Livelihood and Poverty Reduction?
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This introductory chapter utilizes a framework of inquiry on why people are poor based on sustainable livelihood and poverty reduction. A livelihood is sustainable when it copes with and can recover from stress and shocks, maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets, and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the next generation. This book examines the core issues, namely (1) the links between sustainable rural livelihoods and why people are poor; (2) the multilateral policy contexts of poverty; (3) poverty reduction within the context of globalizing world economy; (4) the economic and moral interdependence of humans and nature; and (5) the assessment of poverty among vulnerable groups, for instance, the elderly, the young, the ill, and the disabled. The themes of this volume orbit around characteristics and challenges of sustainable development, marginalization, social empowerment, social development theory, and poverty reduction strategies advocated by the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals worldwide. </jats:p>

TI  - Construction of Agricultural Products of e-Commerce Ecological Network System under the Background of "Internet Plus"
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The rapid development of Internet technology promotes the ecological renewal of traditional industries. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan clearly proposes to vigorously develop the Internet industry. Farmers are still the mainstay of China’s population, and “agriculture, rural areas, and farmers” have always been highly valued by the party and the state. However, the rural economy has always been a weak link in China’s economy, and agricultural products often have problems such as increasing production but not increasing income, relying on the weather, and having difficulties in sales. The root causes are the slow development of rural areas, farmers’ economic awareness and lack of economic information. The Internet has broken this existing situation with the idea of flat network, breaking through the restrictions of traditional agricultural products trading channels, enabling farmers to directly connect with the market, and effectively improving trading profits. Firstly, this paper points out the influence of the Internet on the global economy and industry and further summarizes the development of e-commerce. Then, the advantages and characteristics of e-commerce are explained, and the theoretical basis and present situation of e-commerce development of agricultural products in China are expounded. Finally, the paper puts forward the imagination of China’s e-commerce system of agricultural products, focuses on accelerating the standardization and systematization of agricultural products, and puts forward some suggestions and measures for the ecological evolution guarantee of agricultural products e-commerce. This paper is a research on the integration of agricultural products and ecological construction of e-commerce under the background of “internet plus.” It is aimed at offering suggestions and suggestions for promoting agricultural product sales and rural development and promoting rural economic development, which is of great help to China’s poverty alleviation cause and an effective way to achieve common prosperity.</jats:p>

TI  - Contribution of Agricultural Infrastructure to Rural Development in the Republic of Korea
PY  - 2016
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyse the effects of large-scale agricultural infrastructure investment on rural development. Accordingly, we selected the Yeongsan River Basin Comprehensive Development Project (YRBCADP) as the case project and evaluated the impacts of YRBCADP on agricultural and regional development individually. In terms of agricultural development, YRBCADP has contributed to the increase of farmland area, agricultural productivity, and farm income. The farmland of the project area was increased about 3.5 times, from 43 000 ha in 1970 to 150 000 ha in 2010, and the average rice yield per area was 3.97 t ha-1 in 1973. In addition, YRBCADP has affected regional development positively, such as population, regional income, and transportation accessibility. The ratio of population decrease was 25.6% in the project area but was 41.8% in the no-project area. The local tax per capita in the project area increased from 123 to 1747 million won in the period 1991–2011. The tidal embankment in YRBCADP has shortened travel distance, thus transportation costs were also reduced. This study reviewed the various effects of YRBCARD on rural development, and these results might offer useful information for making decisions for large-scale agricultural infrastructure investment.

TI  - What role can small-scale irrigation play in promoting inclusive rural transformation? Evidence from smallholder rice farmers in the Philippines
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We investigate how user-managed small-scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation. Cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the Philippines, finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy. We also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals. Based on these findings, we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries.

TI  - Speaking the same language: can the sustainable development goals translate the needs of inland fisheries into irrigation decisions?
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigated agriculture and inland fisheries both make important contributions to food security, nutrition, livelihoods and wellbeing. Typically, in modern irrigation systems, these components operate independently. Some practices, commonly associated with water use and intensification of crop production can be in direct conflict with and have adverse effects on fisheries. Food security objectives may be compromised if fish are not considered in the design phases of irrigation systems. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a framework that can serve as a backdrop to help integrate both sectors in policy discussions and optimise their contributions to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Inland fisheries systems do play an important role in supporting many SDG objectives, but these contributions can sometimes be at odds with irrigated agriculture. Using case studies of two globally important river catchments, namely the Lower Mekong and Murray–Darling basins, we highlight the conflicts and opportunities for improved outcomes between irrigated agriculture and inland fisheries. We explore SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) as a path to advance our irrigation systems as a means to benefit both agriculture and inland fisheries, preserving biodiversity and enhancing the economic, environmental and social benefits they both provide to people.2

TI  - AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION: AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Eradication of poverty and hunger are prominent objectives of the MDGs which entails narrowing of inequality gap, access to food by the undernourished and acceleration of economic growth. The key role of agriculture in achieving the MDGs is unarguably very significant as many a scholar attested that agriculture provides food for the populace; generates employment and is a prerequisite stimulant for inter-sectoral linkages. This study is a bold move to assess the feasibility of agriculture in alleviating poverty using data from Nigeria and adopted an econometric method to test our guiding hypotheses. The findings suggested that growth in agricultural output has strong and significant influence in alleviating poverty (reducing the level of poverty). Therefore there is need to ensure a rapid increase in the output of agriculture like fishery, livestock, crops, forestry, staple, etc. through genuine investment in infrastructure, education, health and R&D to ensure sustainable economic growth and development.

TI  - Stakeholder consultations on small-scale irrigation schemes' constraints in Zimbabwe
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) have been considered a solution to viability challenges in drought-stricken farming areas in developing countries. However, the schemes face severe constraints. In this paper, relevant constraints are identified and ranked in terms of how serious the limitations are from the perspective of stakeholders in drought-prone areas of the Chipinge District in Zimbabwe. Information for the study was gained through a questionnaire and focus group discussions with small-scale irrigation farmers as well as key informant interviews with government irrigation officials, irrigation managers and members of the local community leadership. The information was garnered between August and December in 2017 with the analysis conducted using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, guided by the Theory of Constraints and classified in the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) framework. Results indicated that SSIS are important in the drought-prone areas of the Chipinge District regarding food security and income generation. However, technical issues bedevilling the schemes are considered to be the most challenging limitations. The most important constraints—ranked in descending order of gravity—are technical, economic, social, environmental, legal and political challenges. Based on these findings, the research strongly recommends modernising small-scale irrigation schemes’ infrastructure, among other issues, as a priority in Zimbabwe's drought-prone areas.</jats:p>

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Hotspots and Coldspots of Poverty in Nigeria
PY  - 2016
AB  - The study identified the hotspots and coldspots of poverty as well as the determinants of poverty of each identified group. Data were obtained from National Living Standard Survey and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey conducted by National Bureau of Statistics. Spatial econometrics technique was used to analyze data. The result of the analysis identified the hotspots and coldspots of poverty with average poverty rates of 82.6% and 31.8% respectively. The positive significance of spatial dependence of hotspots (r = 0.34) and coldspots (r = 0.21) indicated that spillover of poverty existed in significant proportion among senatorial districts in the two groups. Percentage of people employed in agriculture, type of soil, annual rainfall, household membership of association and access to credit are found to be important determinants of poverty in hotspots of poverty in Nigeria. Incorporation of poverty spillover when designing poverty alleviation programme, increased productivity of people employed in agriculture and the need to bridge the infrastructural gap between the hotspot and coldspots could play a significant role in reducing poverty incidence significantly in Nigeria.

AB  - The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of irrigation on rural poverty across districts in India. The secondary data from different sources have been culled using descriptive cum regression analysis. The statistically significant inverse and strong relationship between irrigation and rural poverty has been pointed out not only from descriptive analysis but also regressions which is expected in this study. The important finding of the study is that irrigation infrastructure is more pronounced as lag variable in determining rural poverty than as normal variable.

TI  - Rethinking irrigation modernisation: realising multiple objectives through the integration of fisheries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigation has been, and will remain, instrumental in addressing water security (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6), food insecurity (SDG 2) and poverty (SDG 1) goals. However, the global context in which irrigation takes place is changing rapidly. A call for healthier and more sustainable food systems is placing new demands on how irrigation is developed and managed. Growing pressures from competing water uses in the domestic and industrial sectors, as well increasing environmental awareness, mean irrigation is increasingly called on to perform better, delivering acceptable returns on investment and simultaneously improving food security, rural livelihoods and nutrition, as well as supporting environmental conservation. Better integration of fisheries (including aquaculture) in irrigation planning, investment and management can contribute to the modernisation of irrigation and the achievement of the multiple objectives that it is called on to deliver. A framework illustrating how fisheries can be better integrated with irrigation, and how the two can complement each other across a range of scales, from scheme to catchment and, ultimately, national level, is presented.

TI  - Community-Organized Irrigated Agriculture Mitigates Local Food Insecurity in India’s Drylands
PY  - 2015
AB  - People who live in semi-arid regions of India are often faced with challenges and constraints of poverty. Foremost among the challenges are the marginal environmental conditions for agriculture, often influenced by low and erratic rainfall. If a meager amount of rainwater is harvested and used sensibly, it could enhance irrigation opportunities leading to better agricultural production. However, due to the lack of proper water harvesting and distribution structures, most of the surface runoff from the rainfall is lost into the rivers. This article presents a case study of community-based lift irrigation practiced in the ecologically fragile drylands of India, with high potential for a more sustainable agriculture that promotes village-level food security.

TI  - Small Scale Irrigation and Agricultural Commercialization in Tigray
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper attempts to demonstrate how access to irrigation determines household’s decision to the extent of market participation in irrigated compared to rainfed systems. By doing so the paper identifies the role of irrigation in share of land allotted to cash crop production, while at the same time highlighting its role in market participation decision of farm households. The results from the sample t-test indicate that irrigation contributes significantly to increase in cash crop production and market participation decision by inducing shifts in farmers cropping mix. Analyzing household data from Kilte-Awlaelo woreda in Eastern Tigray, the findings from the 2SLS model revealed that production value, amount of credit and means of transport by car and mule as reference to human power have positive and significant association with households’ market participation decision. While, non-farm income and using donkey as a means of transport compared to human power have significant and negative association with households’ market participation decision. Overall, this paper concludes with implication for policy to link irrigation development with road infrastructure development and improvements in other marketing services, thus, can help in the long-term transform traditional subsistence agriculture into more market oriented and modern agriculture.

TI  - The impact of Irrigation on Agricultural Productivity: Evidence from India
PY  - NA
AB  - Using plot level production data from a nation-wide survey in India, we study the impact of irrigation on crop productivity, land prices and cropping intensities. Our main identification strategy is based on a sufficient number of households cultivating multiple plots of different irrigation status. After household fixed effects and plot characteristics are controlled for, our estimations show that irrigation has a strong and significant impact on all these outcomes with the dominant effects on cropping intensities. We find quality of irrigation also matters. Our results provide support for continuing investments to improve access and quality of irrigation in India.

TI  - An econometric analysis of the link between irrigation, markets and poverty in Ethiopia: The case of smallholder vegetable and Fruit Production in the North Omo Zone, SNNP Region
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper examines the anti-poverty impacts of irrigation and markets on the welfare of rural households within the PRISM framework. Specifically, the papers addresses: the magnitude of anti-poverty effects of irrigation and conditions strengthening the poverty-reducing impact of it; and the market constraints of fruit and vegetable producers. The relationship between irrigation, market-orientation of smallholders and poverty is examined using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis. In the descriptive analysis, low prices for vegetable and fruit, weak demand, lack of price information, and inadequate transportation have been identified as the main limiting factor for output market. The beneficial effect of irrigation, literacy rate of household heads, and extra years of schooling is readily apparent from the regression. A simulation approach is also used to explore the impact of irrigation and other factors, individually and together, on poverty. The results show that although irrigation reduces poverty, the effect is greater when combined with improving the literacy level of households. This evidence calls for policy measures that focus on the concurrent interventions in irrigation, education, markets, and other supporting inputs, thereby reducing poverty in the cash growing rural areas.

TI  - Access to irrigation and the escape from poverty: Evidence from Northern Mali
PY  - 2008
AB  - "Significant changes in the agricultural sector in northern Mali suggest that irrigation has made a large contribution to welfare increases over the past eight years. Using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and matched difference in differences with a small panel, this study estimates the impact of access to irrigation on poverty, production, and nutrient intakes. The findings suggest that gains in agricultural production value do not transfer uniquely to household consumption. The paper tests two alternative hypotheses about the distribution of agricultural gains: (1) the gains in agricultural production induced by irrigation yield higher household savings, or (2) intra-village transfers from irrigators to non-irrigators contribute to informal social insurance. The paper provides evidence of both saving and sharing within villages as complimentary strategies for consuming gains in agricultural production. This finding suggests that estimating the effects of a program, relying solely on household consumption, may underestimate the welfare gains of irrigation investment by ignoring the household's savings and informal insurance network." from Author's Abstract

TI  - Rural non-farm income and inequality in Nigeria.
PY  - 2009
AB  - "This paper investigates the contribution of rural non-farm income to income inequality by examining the contribution of specific income sources (farm income from irrigated agriculture, farm income from rainfed agriculture and non-farm income) to income inequality in Nigeria. The results reveal the relative importance of specific income sources to income inequality and the various determinants of income inequality in rural Nigeria. Although non-farm income is distributed more unequally than incomes from the other two sources, it contributes least to overall income inequality. Farm income from irrigated agriculture represents the most important inequality-increasing source of income." from authors' abstract

TI  - Investments in agricultural water management for poverty reduction in Africa: Case studies of Limpopo, Nile, and Volta river basins
PY  - 2008
AB  - Much of Sub-Saharan Africa is burdened with water scarcity and poverty. Continentally, less than four percent of Africa's renewable water resources are withdrawn for agriculture and other uses. Investments in agricultural water management can contribute in several ways to achieving the Millennium Development Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and ensuring environmental sustainability. Increased yield and cropping area and shifts to higher valued crops could help boost the income of rural households, generate more employment, and lower consumer food prices. These investments can also stabilize output, income and employment, and have favourable impacts on education, nutrition and health, and social equity. Investments in agricultural water management can cut poverty by uplifting the entitlements and transforming the opportunity structure for the poor. The overall role of investments in agricultural water management in eradicating hunger and poverty is analyzed. This paper contributes to the present debate and efforts to identify strategies and interventions that can effectively contribute to poverty reduction in Africa. It provides an overview of population growth, malnutrition, income distribution and poverty for countries in three case study river basins — Limpopo, Nile, and Volta. With discussions on the contribution of agriculture to national income and employment generation, the paper explores the linkages among water resources investments, agricultural growth, employment, and poverty alleviation. It examines the potential for expansion in irrigation for vertical and horizontal growth in agricultural productivity, via gains in yield and cropping area to boost the agricultural output. Factors constraining such potential, in terms of scarcity and degradation of land and water resources, and poor governance and weak institutions, are also outlined. The paper argues that increased investments in land and water resources and related rural infrastructure are a key pathway to enhance agricultural productivity and to catalyze agricultural and economic growth for effective poverty alleviation.

TI  - Economywide impacts of climate change on agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - Two possible adaptation scenarios to climate change for Sub-Saharan Africa are analyzed under the SRES B2 scenario. The first scenario doubles the irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, compared to the baseline, but keeps total crop area constant. The second scenario increases both rainfed and irrigated crop yields by 25% for all Sub-Saharan African countries. The two adaptation scenarios are analyzed with IMPACT, a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model combined with a water simulation module, and with GTAP-W, a general equilibrium model including water resources. The methodology combines the advantages of a partial equilibrium approach, which considers detailed water-agriculture linkages, with a general equilibrium approach, which takes into account linkages between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors and includes a full treatment of factor markets. The efficacy of the two scenarios as adaptation measures to cope with climate change is discussed. Due to the limited initial irrigated area in the region, an increase in agricultural productivity achieves better outcomes than an expansion of irrigated area. Even though Sub-Saharan Africa is not a key contributor to global food production (rainfed, irrigated or total), both scenarios help lower world food prices, stimulating national and international food markets.

TI  - Integrated assessment—how does it help unpack water access by marginalized farmers?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water is critical to the lives and livelihoods of rural communities in developing countries; however, access to water can be inequitable within communities. This paper uses a generalized integrated assessment approach to explore the determinants of water access by marginalized farmers in two villages in coastal Bangladesh, before and after the setup of local water institutions. The study was part of a broader project aimed at promoting socially inclusive agricultural intensification. An integrative framework was developed in this study to capture and link the diverse range of factors that influence the distribution of water, including the often-overlooked role of social dynamics and governance arrangements. While interventions around improving water resource infrastructure can be critical for freshwater availability, the case studies show that a breakdown of asymmetric power structures may also be needed for water access to all individuals, especially marginalized groups. Establishing a community-based water institution on its own does not necessarily address power issues in a community. It is imperative that the agency and capacities of the marginalized members are developed and that the institutional arrangements foster an enabling environment for marginalized members to influence decision making. Integrated assessment allowed the case studies to be explored from multiple perspectives so as to gain a greater understanding of the barriers and levers to obtaining equitable outcomes from water interventions.

TI  - Erratic rains and erratic markets: Environmental change, economic globalisation and the expansion of shallow groundwater irrigation in West Africa
PY  - 2008
AB  - Climate change and land degradation have considerably altered the conditions for rain-fed agriculture in Northern Ghana. Furthermore, population pressure has led to continuous farming of available agricultural lands and thus caused land degradation. Crop failure and decreasing yields that result from these environmental changes have caused further impoverishment of what was already Ghana’s poorest region. In the past, youth often opted for migration to Ghana’s wealthier south, in order to supplement meagre agricultural livelihoods. However, since the mid-1990s many farmers have started to develop the shallow groundwater irrigation (SGI) capacities of their home region for vegetable gardening. This development has helped a great deal to ameliorate poverty and to reverse rural-urban migration. However, while the irrigators were initially able to profit from the development of good road access to northern Ghana and an increasing demand for vegetables in Ghana’s south, many now frequently meet with market failure. While the sale of fresh tomatoes is met with stiff competition from small-scale farmers from neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ghana’s market is flooded with cheap tomato paste from countries where the production of tomatoes is highly subsidised. Global and regional competition has started to render SGI, developed as a means to locally adapt to environmental change, increasingly risky. As markets become as unreliable as the rains, Ghanaian farmers now face the uphill task of dealing simultaneously with global climate change and globalisation.

TI  - Do the Poor Benefit from Corporate Social Responsibility? A Theory-Based Impact Evaluation of Six Community-Based Water Projects in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2015
AB  - Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can work as an effective means towards minimising business risk and maintaining amicable relationships with diverse groups of stakeholders. While many studies have examined the impacts of CSR on firm value and customer perceptions, little is known about the effects of a philanthropic engagement of the private sector on external stakeholder groups, such as local communities in developing countries. This paper examines welfare effects of six community-based water supply projects that were supported by a thermal power plant in Sri Lanka as part of the company's CSR strategy. The implications of these CSR activities are analysed from the perspective of the project beneficiaries, the majority of them poor smallholder farmers. Household production and labour income functions are estimated from survey data to analyse two pathways through which the water projects affect the beneficiaries' lives. First, the households get individual access to water that allows for the irrigation of home gardens, increases land productivity and changes households' farm output and income (irrigation channel). Second, the projects have an indirect effect on households' income via a time channel, i.e. the effect that due to the individual water access the households save time as there is no need any more to fetch water from far away water bodies or wells. This allows for a reallocation of labour time for other productive income-generating activities. Despite the considerable costs that households have to bear for an individual water connection, the study finds a systematic, positive net income effect of the projects on the beneficiaries via both the irrigation and the time channel. Qualitative evidence supports these findings and also reveals additional positive, non-monetarised project impacts. As the water projects would not have been realised without the subsidiary financial support of the power plant, it is concluded that the company's CSR engagement is increasing the welfare of the beneficiary communities.

TI  - Too big to handle, too important to abandon: Reforming Sudan’s Gezira scheme
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Participatory irrigation management (PIM) has been broadly promoted by public administrators and donor organizations. The reasons for this push include performance failures of state-controlled irrigation schemes and the need to improve irrigation productivity for meeting rising food demands. A popular reform for increasing participation and ownership is represented by Irrigation Management Transfers (IMTs). IMTs mean replacing the government with the civil society (farmers) in irrigation management, and they go beyond working with the public sector as in PIM. These widely implemented reforms produced mixed experiences. Besides, the evaluation of IMT cases is reliant on scarce quantitative data. IMTs are also difficult to replicate due to methodological issues. However, qualitative research can engage with stakeholders’ perceptions and narratives, especially the most relevant target group, namely farmers. We provide in this study stakeholders’ opinions and attitudes towards several waves of IMT reforms in the Gezira scheme in Sudan. This mega-scheme is of high developmental and socio-cultural importance for the country ever since the independence from the British Empire. Using a perception survey and in-depth interviews with key informants, we illustrate the failure legacies to reform the Gezira scheme by enhancing farmers’ participation through Water User Associations (WUAs). While both farmers and experts have suggested a poor implementation, inadequate farmers’ involvement and unclear objectives of the reforms, the reforms’ recurrent failures are explained within complex historic and political contexts. There are long-standing legacies of development missteps of the Gezira scheme, with no clear and ultimate triggers of performance deterioration. Besides, splits in professional cultures, power imbalances, political instrumentalization (of farmers) and the lack of farmers’ awareness or capacities are salient factors for understanding the poor state of the Gezira scheme. It is difficult for stand-alone irrigation management reforms to be successful. Such reforms need to be embedded within a comprehensive policy package that prioritizes irrigation governance and proposes sound regulations based on clear roles, consensus-making and prior consultation.

TI  - TRADITIONAL IRRIGATION AND WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN HIGHLAND ETHIOPIA: CASE STUDY IN DANGILA WOREDA
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper examines traditional irrigation practices and their contribution to rural livelihoods in Dangila woreda (district) in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. Data were collected from November 2010 to May 2011 through a questionnaire survey of 126 irrigators and field observation of irrigation practices. The results show that over 90% of the irrigators used furrow systems. Around 54% of them reported that irrigation had contributed 11–20% to their household incomes in the past 12 years (1999/2000–2010/2011). The majority of the farmers agreed that the use of irrigation has increased in area coverage, crop outputs and contribution to household incomes over the past two decades. Water was distributed on rotation turns headed by water committees that were headed by individuals locally referred to as Yewha Abat (water fathers). Over 60% of the respondents indicated that they faced water and irrigable land shortages where the latter significantly influence households' irrigation income (significant at p < 0.0005). Although traditional irrigation has been known in the study area for many years, the attention offered to it from state agencies has not been encouraging. The study recommends appropriate institutional support to be provided to smallholder irrigators to improve the overall performance of traditional irrigation schemes.

TI  - Prioritizing Rural Investments in Africa: A Hybrid Evaluation Approach Applied to Uganda
PY  - 2015
AB  - Prioritizing public investments requires information on relative returns that is difficult to derive from disparate evaluation studies. This article presents a ‘hybrid’ approach that combines ex post evaluation data with an economywide model for experimenting ex ante with alternative investment portfolios within a consistent, structural framework. The approach is used to evaluate rural investments in Uganda. Agricultural research and extension services are found to be more effective at promoting economic growth and poverty reduction than either rural feeder roads or irrigation infrastructure. This suggests that the government’s recent shift in emphasis from extension services to irrigation may potentially reduce the overall benefits of its agricultural investment plan.

TI  - Gradient effect on farmers’ income in the mountain areas and its implication for poverty alleviation strategies: Empirical analysis from the upper reach of Minjiang River, China
PY  - 2012
AB  - Using four types of settlements in the upper reach of Minjiang River as case, we establish structural models in farmers’ income of different settlement patterns based on rural household panel data to reveal the gradient effect on farmers’ income and determinants. The results indicate that: (1) except the resettlement area, the incomes for farmers living in river valley, semi-mountain, and high-mountain settlements present a decreasing trend with the elevation increasing; on the contrary, their nonfarm earnings show an increasing trend with the elevation decreasing; (2) from the effect on farmers’ income, there is a common feature that the nonfarm earnings and farming incomes have significant positive effects, and family size and productive expenditure have significant negative effects. One exception to this is the productive expenditure, which becomes insignificant in the model of resettlement area; (3) from the way of increasing farmers’ income and alleviating poverty, there are great differences for four types of settlements in mountain areas, however, the improvement of agricultural product sales, agricultural production subsidies, the expansion for nonfarm employment, and the control of the family’s size are the most effective approaches for poverty alleviation.

TI  - Effectiveness of Irrigation Access on Sticky Rice Productivity: Evidence from Lao PDR
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study estimates the impact of irrigation on household sticky rice productivity in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) by applying propensity score matching (PSM) and the difference-in-differences (DID) method. This paper utilizes panel data from the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) from 2003 to 2013. The results show that the average sales value and total production of sticky rice for irrigated households is greater than those for non-irrigated households by around 36 to 38% per season. Moreover, irrigated households experience improved sticky rice productivity of approximately 2.44 tons per hectare, per season, compared to non-irrigated households. In particular, compared to households with access to irrigation in one period of the surveys, households with access to irrigation in two periods of the surveys have nearly double the sticky rice productivity. Therefore, long-term access to irrigation is more effective for sticky rice productivity. However, we cannot find any evidence to support the impact of irrigation on household consumption. Some policy implications that can be derived from this research are that farmers should be intensively promoted to make the most use of irrigation, development of irrigation system is highly needed, and to ensure effectiveness of irrigation utilization local farmer involvement in monitoring procedure of irrigation is necessary.

PY  - 2017
AB  - In Tigray, over 78,000 dugout ponds have been constructed since 2000. The objective was to alleviate the problem of recurrent drought that prevails in the region every five to ten years. However, it has been reported that most of the ponds are not functional. Therefore, this paper presents an assessment of the dugout pond construction in Tigray with a particular emphasis to challenges and technical problems and pinpoints the causes that led to the poor performance of the ponds. Thus, even though rainwater harvesting ponds have the potential to ensure availability of water for various uses and generate income for smallholders, poor performance levels and insufficient impacts to local communities were widely observed in the study area due to inadequate site selection, absence of biophysical survey during design and construction, leakage and evaporation losses, and poor management of the ponds.

TI  - Making Technological Innovation Work for Sustainable Development
PY  - 2015
AB  - Sustainable development requires harnessing technological innovation to improve human well-being in current and future generations. However, poor, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic or political power to shape innovation processes to meet their needs. Issues arise at all stages of innovation, from invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Three insights should inform efforts to intervene in innovation systems for sustainable development. First, innovation is not a linear process but rather a complex adaptive system involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global levels; interventions must take this complexity into account. Second, there has been significant experimentation in mobilizing technology for sustainable development in the health, energy, and agriculture sectors, among others, but learning from past experience requires structured cross-sectoral comparisons and recognition of the socio-technical nature of innovation. Third, the current constellation of rules, norms, and incentives shaping innovation is not always aligned towards sustainable development. Past experience demonstrates that it is possible to reform these institutions, and the imperative of harnessing innovation for sustainable development makes it necessary to do so. Many actors have the power to re-orient innovation systems towards sustainable development through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We offer three proposals to begin: mobilizing global financing to invest in inventing suitable and affordable technologies to meet sustainable development objectives; developing measures to engage marginalized populations systematically through all stages of the innovation process; and establishing channels for regularized learning across domains of practice.

TI  - Effect of Adoption of Irrigation on Rice Yield in the Municipality of Malanville, Benin
PY  - 2017
AB  - The paper employed a Heckman selectivity model to determine factors influencing the adoption of irrigation and its effect on rice yield in Benin. Results from probit estimates indicate that farmer's age, gender, extension services, access to credit, market participation, distance to irrigation scheme, use of tractor and fertilizer are factors affecting the probability of irrigation adoption. Results from Heckman second stage estimates show that the adoption of irrigation contributes significantly to rice yield improvement by 57 per cent. For robustness checks of the estimated effect of adoption of irrigation, the propensity score matching method was used. The results indicate that the percentage increase in rice yield due to irrigation adoption varies between 55 per cent and 60 per cent. This confirms the finding of the Heckman estimates. Other variables explaining rice yield are education, extension services, access to credit, market participation, off farm income, use of tractor, labour, and fertilizer. These results imply that besides the adoption of irrigation the provision of complementary services are needed to achieve the objective of productivity improvement.

TI  - Investment in irrigation as a poverty reduction strategy: analysis of small-scale irrigation impact on poverty in Tigray, Ethiopia
PY  - 2008
AB  - The regional government of Tigray has invested in millions of Birr to develop irrigation schemes as a strategy of poverty reduction. The study was based on a representative sample of 613 farm households (331 irrigators and 282 non-irrigators) drawn using three stage stratified sampling with probability proportional to size. The main aim of this paper is to study the impact of irrigation on household income, therefore, to contribute to the scant literature on irrigation-poverty reduction nexus in Ethiopia, which policy makers can use it as an input to make informed policy decisions in their future endeavors. We found that farming income is more important to irrigating households than to non-irrigating households, while off-farm income is negatively related with access to irrigation. We also found that irrigating households\u2019 average income is above the regional average, while non-irrigating households\u2019 average income is 50 percent less than the average income of irrigating households. Although there can be other factors, which may contribute to the difference in income, these results are in line with our expectation and supports the decision of the Tigray government to use irrigation as a poverty reduction tool. We have used a stochastic dominance analysis and found that the results are consistent. This result differs from a previous study by Pender et al. (2002), which argues that irrigation has less impact in agricultural yields than expected, reducing returns to investment in modern irrigation.

TI  - Increased malaria incidence following irrigation practices in the Endorheic Rift Valley Basin of Sidama Region, Ethiopia.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Water resource development practice such as irrigation is key to ensuring economic growth and food security in developing countries. However, unintended public health problems such as malaria linked to such development projects have been a concern. This study aimed to determine the impact of irrigation on malaria incidence and vector mosquito abundance in southern Ethiopia.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Eight years' malaria morbidity data were extracted from the medical registers of health facilities in both irrigated and non-irrigated settings.

TI  - Water at the Centre of Poverty Reduction: Targeting Women as a Stepping Stone in the Nadowli District, Ghana
PY  - 2018
AB  - Poverty reduction has been a challenge in developing countries, pushing many development partners to devise strategies to tackle it. One of such strategies is the provision of water services. Although there has been much focus on water provision, the practice and benefits of integrating multiple-use water services in the design and implementation have been underexplored. This paper argues for the role of multiple-use water services in reducing rural poverty, especially among women. This is based on a case study that was conducted in two communities in the Upper West Region where multipleuse water services have been provided. Data was collected using focus groups discussion mainly with water user associations who are made up of women only, survey of 26 households, and physical observations of the water infrastructure and activities around the infrastructure. We found that access to water services saved time in water collection and contributed to increase household productive hours. Consequently, this resulted in increased output in their economic activities with positive ripple effects on other sectors of the rural economy, leading to poverty reduction as indicated by the participants. It is argued that investing in multiple-use water services is a major way of empowering women to actively engage in multiple streams of income and thus a great potential for achieving the sustainable development goals.

TI  - Re-thinking the unimpeded tube-well growth under the depleting groundwater resources in the Punjab, Pakistan
PY  - 2018
AB  - Groundwater resources are crucial in sustaining agro-ecosystems and ensuring food security in many parts of the world, including Pakistan. However, the sustainability of groundwater resources is subject to a number of challenges, including over-extraction, deterioration in quality, and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and population growth. Given the current state of groundwater resources in Pakistan, policymakers seek to manage groundwater resources by limiting groundwater extraction. To achieve this goal on a national scale, it is important to understand the determinants of the decisions made by local farmers in respect of tube-well adoption. This study investigates smallholder farmers’ decisions to adopt tube-well technology in the face of dwindling groundwater resources and falling water tables. Analysis is based on a cross-sectional survey of 200 rural households from the arid to semi-arid predominantly groundwater-irrigated plains of the Punjab province, Pakistan. It is found that farmers will adopt tube-well technology in pursuit of reliable irrigation water supplies to hedge against production risks but not against the risk associated with unfavourable extreme events (downside risk) such as total crop failure. This suggests that the adoption decision is influenced by the expected long-term rather than the short-term benefits. This paper draws attention to the need to regulate groundwater resource exploitation by requiring the use of tube-well technology to be accompanied by irrigation water-efficient techniques and technologies.

TI  - Is water and land redistribution a driver of economic growth and poverty reduction? Lessons from Zimbabwe
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper analyses the case of Zimbabwe since independence to examine the extent to which the redistribution of land and water in developing countries results in economic growth and a reduction in poverty. In order to maximize water's contribution to poverty reduction and economic growth it is necessary to (1) distinguish between communal and commercial farmers; (2) ensure that institutions are in place to support the new communal farmers and enable them to make decisions about how best to use their new wealth; and (3) design irrigation systems with low operational costs and easy maintenance.

TI  - Crop Water Productivity of Irrigated Teff in a Water Stressed Region
PY  - 2013
AB  - In water stressed regions such as the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia, increasing Crop Water Productivity (CWP) is imperative for sustainable food and water security. This paper presents CWP of Teff (Eragrostic Tef), a staple food in Ethiopia and an important export crop. Field experiments were conducted under irrigated agriculture during the dry seasons in the periods: 1) November 2010 to March 2011; and 2) December 2011 to April, 2012 at Melkassa Agricultural Research Centre in Ethiopia. Teff crop was irrigated at sixteen different water application depths ranging from 100 to 25 % of the optimum Crop Water Evapotranspiration (ETc.) during the four growing stages, the initial, development, mid season and late season. The effect of seeding rates of 25 kg/ha and 10 kg/ha on lodging and yield of the crop was also determined. The main results were: 1) At 25 % deficit irrigation applied for the whole growth period, Teff CWP was the highest at 1.16 and 1.08 kg/m3 respectively for the seeding rates of 25 kg/ha and 10 kg/ha; 2) the CWP slightly decreased to 1.12 and 1.07 kg/m3 when the 25 % deficit was applied during the late season stage; 3) the crop yield response factor (Ky) of 1.09 and 1.19 was obtained for seeding rates of 25 kg/ha and 10 kg/ha respectively; the equivalent biomass response factor (Ky) was less at 0.88 and 0.96 respectively.

TI  - The effect of infrastructural challenges on food security in Ntambanana, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - Rural infrastructural inadequacies in South Africa are well documented, but their effects on local food security remain relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the effects of insufficient infrastructural services on food security issues at household and community level in the area of Ntambanana, which is characterised as a dry environment with few water reservoir facilities effective farming. Focus group discussions were held with existing groupings of men and women, and interviews were conducted with governmental officials and community members. A questionnaire then was used to confirm responses and test the reliability of information from the interviews. Our study found that there was poor infrastructure and inadequate support from relevant organisations; the roads were not in good condition limiting access to market facilities and other destinations and lack of an efficient and effective transportation system crippling the performance of small-scale farmers. Recommendations emerging from this study include the need for attention to be paid to address the fundamental deficiencies that hinder food security. Better infrastructure would enable rural areas to compete with the urban markets and to attract internal and external investors.

TI  - OPTIMIZING TEFF PRODUCTIVITY IN WATER STRESSED REGION OF ETHIOPIA OPTIMISER LA PRODUCTIVITE DE TEFF DANS LA REGION DE STRESS HYDRIQUE DE L'ETHIOPIE
PY  - 2011
AB  - Smallholder rainfed agriculture, characterized by a low-input and low-output system, has been the main stay of the Economy of Ethiopia. In the past two decades, growing population pressure in the highland areas of rainfed agriculture on a rapidly dwindling water resources and declining natural resource base has put irrigated agriculture to a prominent position on the country’s development agenda. Deficit irrigation is viewed as one of the best alternative methods of irrigation to optimize crop and water productivity of the 10 million ha arable land of Ethiopia. Teff is a rainfed crop and is the major staple food crop in Ethiopia. It has no gluten and is considered a healthy food grain. This paper reports on the field experimental findings on Teff productivity under deficit irrigation in Melkassa, one of the water stressed regions in Ethiopia. The experiment was done with a factorial combination of various levels of irrigation application (100, 75, 50, 25 and 0% of the optimum irrigation requirement) and different dates of irrigation during the four growth stages of Teff. The seeding rates were 15 and 25 kg/ha. Irrigating Teff at 75% of its optimum irrigation requirement with a seed rate of 15kg/ha has resulted in a yield of 5 ton/ha. At 50% irrigation application and 25 kg/ha seed rate, the productivity was 3 ton/ha. Both are significantly higher than the average yield of 1 ton/ha for rainfed Teff. Proper land preparation contributed to the increase in yield as it minimized water and nutrient loss from the irrigated field. Also, the lower seeding rate significantly reduced lodging problems and boosted the productivity.

TI  - Understanding Agriculture Production and Food Security in Ethiopia from the Perspective of China
PY  - 2018
AB  - Food security and sustainable agricultural development are the hot issues of scientific research, especially after the population affected by hunger surprisingly increased in 2016. Long-lasting and recurrent famines caused by natural disasters and wars have afflicted Ethiopia. Unlike Ethiopia, which is still struggling to achieve food self-sufficiency, China managed to quickly become food self-sufficient at a rapid speed, despite the fact that it also faced the same challenges of famine over the last century. In the backdrop of differing environmental and socio-political challenges the two countries face, comparing the similarities and differences between the two countries will yield important lessons and insights for Ethiopia to follow to achieve food self-sufficiency. Here, the progress towards food security in Ethiopia and China is presented to quantitatively compare the gap of agricultural production between both countries. We found that food production in Ethiopia is heavily constrained by drought, soil degradation, climate change, out-dated agricultural production technologies, and poverty. According to these challenges, we examined corresponding responses in China to propose solutions for achieving food self-sufficiency in Ethiopia, given the realities of its unique national situation.

TI  - Conceptual framework for revitalisation of small-scale irrigation schemes in southern Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper presents a conceptual framework for revitalising small-scale irrigation schemes which are either performing poorly or have partially collapsed due to a combination of infrastructural, social-economic, institutional and governance problems, among others. The framework is based on the understanding that an irrigation scheme consists of four mutually interlinked systems: the physical system, the cropping system, the economic system and the social-organisational system. The conceptual approach has two main elements: defining the methodology for revitalisation and implementation of the revitalisation process. The methodology is defined by conducting diagnostic studies to assess water availability, irrigation system, socio-organisation, economic, and market conditions of the scheme. The implementation process involves rehabilitating physical infrastructure, building the capacity of the farmers and extension workers to sustain the revitalised scheme and developing a framework for monitoring and evaluating the performance of that scheme. The whole revitalisation process is built on the foundations of learning from past experience (historical perspective) and continuous stakeholder consultation. The application of the framework and the hypothesis that improved understanding of existing schemes and improved training for farmers results in improved performance of small-scale irrigation schemes are yet to be investigated. The authors invite readers' reaction to the proposed framework

We focus on risk related to agriculture, since vulnerability and agriculture are intimately linked in SSA due to the location of the poor, their dependence on agriculture and the inherent risks of an agricultural livelihood. We argue that agricultural growth is one of the most effective means for improving permanent incomes and reducing vulnerability. However, agriculture is not homogeneous, and the inherent risks vary across countries and regions. Therefore, we also discuss appropriate investment strategies and policy instruments for different sets of risks." from Authors' Abstract

TI  - Assessment of Suitable Areas for Home Gardens for Irrigation Potential, Water Availability, and Water-Lifting Technologies
PY  - 2018
AB  - The study was conducted in Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia to assess potentially irrigable areas for home gardens, water availability, and feasibility of water-lifting technologies. A GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique was applied to access the potential of surface and groundwater sources for irrigation. The factors affecting irrigation practice were identified and feasibility of water-lifting technologies was evaluated. Pairwise method and expert’s opinion were used to assign weights for each factor. The result showed that about 345,000 ha and 135,000 ha of land were found suitable for irrigation from the surface and groundwater sources, respectively. The rivers could address about 1–1.2% of the irrigable land during dry season without water storage structure whereas groundwater could address about 2.2–2.4% of the irrigable land, both using conventional irrigation techniques. If the seven major dams within the basin were considered, surface water potential would be increased and satisfy about 21% of the irrigable land. If rainwater harvesting techniques were used, about 76% of the basin would be suitable for irrigation. The potential of surface and groundwater was evaluated with respect to water requirements of dominant crops in the region. On the other hand, rope pump and deep well piston hand pump were found with relatively the most (26%) and the least (9%) applicable low-cost water-lifting technologies in the basin.

TI  - Does access to small scale irrigation promote market oriented production in Ethiopia
PY  - NA
AB  - The study examined the extent and nature of market oriented production in irrigated compared to rainfed systems in Ethiopia. By doing so the paper identifies the role of irrigation in market-oriented production, while at the same time highlighting the main constraints to market oriented development. Our results indicate that irrigation contributes significantly to increases in market participation, volume of marketed produce and, hence, income, by inducing shifts in farmers\u2019 cropping mix. The impact of commercialization of production on household food security is not direct and immediate mainly because of failures in the food market. While irrigation enhances market production, there are series of factors that pose serious constraints to market production. Land size, oxen holding, access to market and means of transport were found to be important determinants of market oriented production calling for policy interventions in land markets, access to productive assets and infrastructure development and policy measures to improve the performance of agricultural markets. The study also found education has market promoting effect in terms of increasing the probability of participation and volume of sale. Increased support to education can, thus, help in the long-term to transform traditional subsistence agriculture into more market-oriented agriculture. Finally there are unobserved site specific effects, related to location and other covariates, which influence market participation and volume decisions.

TI  - Sustaining participation in irrigation systems of Ethiopia: what have we learned about water user associations?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Community participation, defined as engaging users of schemes in the decision-making processes for the planning and implementation of irrigation projects, is critical for the sustainability of irrigation schemes. This study was carried out in three regional states of Ethiopia to investigate the contribution of water user associations (WUAs) to sustaining participation in irrigation projects. The paper demonstrates that the poor understanding of community participation and institutional development by project staff in donor-supported irrigation projects results in the poor performance of WUAs in enhancing participation in irrigation systems. The interventions of external bodies in setting up the WUA by-laws and in determining the responsibilities of users and WUA committees contributed to the low level of participation. The transfer of schemes to WUAs without building WUA committees' abilities in operation and maintenance constrained their ability to sustainably manage irrigation schemes. The WUA committees are male-dominated and the views of women are hardly represented in the decision making. Therefore, establishing WUA committees that reflect the interests and inputs of scheme users is crucial to achieve fair decision making. Local authorities and non-governmental organizations could do more to change perceptions and behaviour to reflect the importance of gender equity in sustaining the positive outcomes of irrigation at household and community levels.

TI  - Spawning migration of
            <i>Labeobarbus</i>
            species of Lake Tana across the Gilgel Abay River Weir, Ethiopia: The challenges to fish spawning migration and proposed management solutions
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lake Tana is one of the largest freshwater bodies in East Africa, with its 18 Labeobarbus species being the world's last remaining Cyprinid species flock. Many of them feed and grow in Lake Tana and migrate to the tributaries of the lake to reproduce. The construction of irrigation structures is increasing in the tributary rivers, however, without due attention being given to the spawning migration routes and critical spawning habitats. The present study examined the impacts of the Gilgel Abay Weir on the spawning migration of these species and discusses possible interactions with other human-related impacts and potential mitigation measures. Fish samples were taken twice monthly from July to November 2019, both below and above the weir with gillnets. No spawning migration to the upstream of the weir has occurred since its construction, with the weir being a barrier to their spawning migration route of Lake Tana fisheries. Of the 11 species caught, only Labeobarbus intermedius (a habitat generalist) was observed above the weir, with the species diversity being significantly higher below the weir (p < 0.05) than above it. The total number of species observed during the present study was also lower, compared with previous reports. The fisheries impacts may also have been exacerbated by other contributing factors such as habitat destruction, river system degradation, destructive fishing practices and weed infestation, a situation which may lead to the collapse of Lake Tana fisheries and ultimately the lake's ecology. Reversing this situation is crucial, noting the implementation of such measures as habitat restoration and improvement, replacing the weir with environmentally friendly technologies, prohibition of illegal fishing, and construction of fish ladders could definitely alleviate the observed negative impacts of the Gilgel Abay Weir on the fisheries.

TI  - Micro And Macro-Level Approaches For Assessing The Value Of Irrigation Water - Micro and Macro-Level Approaches for Assessing the Value of Irrigation Water
PY  - 2005
AB  - Many countries are reforming their economies and setting macroeconomic policies that have direct and indirect impact on the performance of the irrigation sector. One reason for the movement toward reform in the water sector across countries is that water resources are increasingly becoming a limiting factor for many human activities. Another reason for increased pressures to address water policy issues is that many countries are in the process of removing barriers to trade, particularly in agricultural commodities. Therefore, knowledge of the value of water when crafting domestic and macroeconomic policies is important to compare the variable impacts of reform across sectors of the economy and populations within the country. Researchers have used many methods for assessing the value of irrigation water. This survey reviews a broad literature to ascertain how two basic questions have been addressed by research over the past few decades. First, what is the value of water across different sectors and levels? Second, how will this value change under different macroeconomic and domestic policies? This survey details a number of methods for approaching these two questions. The literature has been organized according to a progression from theoretical underpinnings to empirical approaches to how the value of irrigation services are relevant to the link between globalization and poverty.

TI  - Farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in Benin: a stakeholder-consultation approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractThis article examines rice farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in the municipality of Malanville, Benin. Farmers’ positive perceptions of irrigation include the use of irrigation for insurance against drought, crop yield improvement, higher income, food security and poverty reduction. Analysis of constraints reveals that farmers face major constraints such as lack of agricultural credit, poor access to production inputs, inadequate knowledge of water resources management, poor access to agricultural information and markets, and flooding of fields. Specific constraints in the irrigation scheme of Malanville include the high cost of irrigation and unavailability of water.

TI  - Smallholder adaptation to climate change: dynamics and limits in Northern Ghana
PY  - 2011
AB  - Climate change and land degradation result in decreasing yields and crop failures in Northern Ghana and have caused further impoverishment of Ghana’s poorest region. Farmers have diversified their livelihoods to adapt to uncertain environmental conditions in various ways. While traditionally a diversification of the production and migration were the prime means of adaptation, many farmers have started to intensify their production by adopting shallow groundwater irrigation for vegetable gardening for Ghana’s urban markets. This has helped to cope with a changing environment, ameliorated poverty and reversed rural–urban migration, while the local hydrology curbed an over-exploitation of groundwater resources, commonly associated with an uncontrolled farmer-driven expansion of groundwater irrigation. This research confirms that farmer-driven small-scale irrigation can play an important role in the process of climate change adaptation. However, while farmers tried to integrate in the larger economy, they have become subject to market failures that in their essence are caused by unfair and unpredictable patterns of global trade. It is this double exposure to global environmental change and economic globalization that need to be taken into consideration when local adaptive capacities are discussed. Many convincing arguments call for the revision of some of the most unfair and devastating economic practices; however, the need to enhance adaptive capacity towards global climate change for poor parts of the population in the south should be added to the discussion.

TI  - Effect of Small-scale Irrigation on the Farm Households’ Income of Rural Farmers: The Case of Girawa District, East Hararghe, Oromia, Ethiopia
PY  - NA
AB  - Irrigation is one means by which agricultural production can be increased to meet the growing food demands in the world. This study evaluated the effect of small-scale irrigation on farm household income in production. The specific objective of this study is to identify the factors in-fluencing participation in small-scale irrigation and provides bases for policy makers in Girawa district, Eastern Hararghe zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data were collect-ed for the study. Primary data were collected from 200 sample respondents drawn from both par-ticipant and non-participant households. Preliminary statistics and econometric models were em-ployed for data analysis. The logistic regression estimation of factors affecting participation re-vealed that age of household head, non-farm income, livestock size, size of cultivated land, dis-tance between plot and irrigation scheme, means of transportation and participation of household heads in social organization significantly affected the participation decision of households in irri-gation farming. Results showed that participation in irrigation has a significant, positive effect on farm households’ income. Therefore, policy makers should give due emphasis to the aforemen-tioned variables to increase participation in irrigation farming and improve the livelihood of rural households.

TI  - On positive externalities from irrigated agriculture and their policy implications: An overview
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water has important economic values, mainly in the agricultural sector. Beside enhancing agricultural output and crop diversification, irrigation generates positive externalities which have been little emphasized by the literature. The purpose of this review is to investigate the direct, indirect and potential benefits of water use in agriculture by taking an additional step towards the identification and economic evaluation of the observed positive, social, environmental and ecological effects of irrigation. Five categories of contributions are examined: irrigation returns flows for groundwater recharge; biodiversity and wildlife habitat; landscape aesthetic and cultural values; nutrient recycling and retention; and improved health, nutritionand living conditions. Knowing the economic value of such positive externalities would help to get the right policy incentives for better water use and increased water savings in a context of growing water scarcity.

TI  - The Role of Assets in the Enhancement of Households' Income: A Study of Poverty Alleviation among Rural Communities of Kelantan and Terengganu
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper aims to examine the role of assets and entitlements on the enhancement of farmers’ income. Using a structured socio-economic questionnaire, 302 randomly selected farmers in both Kelantan and Terengganu states were tested. To answer the study’s objectives, one way ANOVA test was carried out and tested. The results indicated that access to land, fertilizers, tractors, and health facilities, quality of housing, market, and livestock have significant positive impact on farmers’ wellbeing. Access to irrigation and having savings (at banks and/or homes) were found to have significant negative impact on farmers’ monthly income. Education and association memberships are not essential factors that might contribute to the enhancement of farmers’ livelihood. Investing in productive assets was found to be more effective rather than safekeeping the money in a bank or at home. However, households and farmers deal with their own assets and entitlement differently. As a result, assets are found to decrease the income of farmers partially due to the farmers’ decision-making strategies which seems to be poor and inadequate. Therefore, incorporating psychological perspective such as farmers’ behaviours and perceptions are utmost important in order to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying the farmers who are falling in poverty trap.

TI  - Irrigation Water Management in Small Scale Irrigation Schemes: the Case of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake Basin
PY  - 2014
AB  - Appraisals of irrigation water management scenarios are crucial in project performance monitoring. A comprehensive irrigation water management study has been conducted on four small scale irrigation schemes in the Ethiopian rift valley lake basin. It is observed that from 147 irrigators 68% faced irrigation water supply unreliability, 79.1% encountered unfair distribution of water and 66 % underwent through timeliness problem in water distribution occasionally. All the investigated schemes witnessed a weak (50 % of all scheme users noted poor) organization of irrigation scheme administration. The Water Users Associations (WUAs) lack clear laws/by-laws and strategies to lead small or major canal operations and maintenances. Without a strong WUA it is impossible to think of filling farmer’s skill gap, to have a working maintenance strategy, fair distribution of irrigation water, reliable irrigation water supply and timely delivery of irrigation water.

AB  - <jats:p>Climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity and evidence shows possibility of shifts in earth's climate. Concern over the potential effects of long-term climatic change on agriculture has been raised over the past decade. Change in the climatic conditions on the globe created threat to the availability water for agriculture production. The present chapter is an attempt to distil what is known about the likely effects of climate change on water availability to agriculture for food security and nutrition in coming decades. Apart from few exceptions, the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture water resources in the future are not understood in any great depth. There are many uncertainties as to how changes in various environmental parameters will interact with the availability of water and further agriculture production. The future consequences of water resources on agriculture are discussed and summarized. Possible mitigation and adaptations to changing water availability for agriculture are also discusses.</jats:p>

TI  - The Relationship between Smallholder Irrigation and Household Food Availability and Dietary Diversity in Greater Tzaneen Municipality of Limpopo Province, South Africa
PY  - 2016
AB  - Irrigation farming has the potential to address household food security challenges in developing countries. This paper examines household food availability, consumption and dietary diversity for irrigating and non-irrigating households in Greater Tzaneen municipality of Limpopo Province of South Africa. The paper uses primary data collected from 180 households comprising of irrigation scheme irrigators, independent (non-scheme) irrigators, and non-irrigating households. Data analysis employed descriptive analysis and analysis of variance to compare food security components of the different types of households. Results provide sufficient evidence that smallholder irrigation farming contributes significantly to household food security through improved food availability and dietary diversity. However, since most households are net food buyers, it is essential to have policies that are formulated with an understanding that household food security is not only a function of the food that farming households produce for their own consumption but more so a function of total household income. The results inform agrarian reform debates on whether South Africa should continue investing in smallholder irrigation farming for improved household welfare. An integration of smallholder irrigation farming in strategies for growing the rural economy and contributing to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction is, therefore, recommended.

TI  - A re-examination of the impact of irrigation on rice production in Benin: An application of the endogenous switching model
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Irrigation offers important opportunities for enhancing crop yield and production in developing countries. This paper provides a re-examination of the impact of irrigation on rice production in Benin. It employed an endogenous switching model to account for bias due to observable and unobservable factors. The results indicated that the age of the farmer, gender, education, extension services, credit, access to media, ownership of mobile phone, off-farm income, and distance from home to irrigation scheme are factors affecting the probability of the adoption of irrigation. The results also revealed that adoption of irrigation is positively associated with rice productivity improvement. Farm variables such as soil fertility, labor, and fertilizer and herbicide application have a positive effect on rice productivity. Other variables increasing the rice yield were: education, credit, off-farm income, and access to media. These findings suggest that investments in irrigation should be accompanied by the provision of institutional support measures and complementary farm inputs to enhance the impact of irrigation on rice production.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>An attempt has been made in this paper to analyse the spatio-temporal variations of cropping intensity and irrigation intensity, and their relationship, in North Twenty Four Parganas district in West Bengal, India from 1996/97 to 2015/16. The relationship between cropping intensity and irrigation intensity has been assessed using partial correlation, residual mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis. One-way ANOVA has been conducted for testing the equality of cluster means. Temporal analysis from 1996/97 to 2015/16 has shown a low positive correlation between cropping intensity and irrigation intensity for the entire district. Analysis at Agricultural Block level has revealed that cropping intensity decreased in many cases even after an increase in irrigation intensity. In general, cropping intensity has increased with the increase in irrigation intensity in the Coastal Saline Region and the Ichhamati Basin, whereas cropping intensity has increased even after a decrease in irrigation intensity in the Gangetic Plains Region in the district.</jats:p>

TI  - Risk, Infrastructure, and Rural Market Integration: Implications of Infrastructure Provision for Food Markets and Household Consumption in Rural Indonesia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Utilizing original panel data collected in 2007 and 2010 in rural Indonesia for 2261 households located in 98 villages in 7 provinces, this paper investigates the food markets' functions with different extents of integration, and aims to interlink three important factors in the process of economic development — risk, infrastructure and welfare — of the rural poor. Focusing especially on irrigation systems and local paved roads, we explore the potential effect of infrastructure in relation to the global food price crisis that occurred in 2007–08 and thereafter affected poor households in rural Indonesia. The most important finding from our empirical analysis can be seen in the villages with relatively low integration to the surrounding markets, but which had access to irrigation systems. In those villages food prices, and in particular the price of rice, were kept lower, even when rural Indonesia experienced a spike in food prices. This implies that, although the implication is contrastive to rice producers (net sellers), irrigation facilities offset the negative effects for rural households by maintaining a relatively abundant food supply in local markets. Along with this investigation, the threshold estimation examines whether there exists a certain threshold for the proportion of local paved roads that divides villages according to either lower or higher spatial connectivity. Our results clearly indicate the existence of such a threshold. These findings suggest that when evaluating the potential role of irrigation and the effectiveness of irrigation development and management, it is important to pay more attention to the functions of the surrounding markets as related to rural road conditions, in addition to the direct impact of irrigation on agricultural productivity as it affects households.

TI  - UTILISATION OF IRRIGATION FACILITIES TOWARDS POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE UPPER WEST REGION OF GHANA
PY  - 2011
AB  - The economy of the Upper West Region of Ghana is largely agrarian with an estimated 86 percent of the population engaged in agricultural production as a source of livelihood. However, agriculture in the region is beset with a single maxima and erratic rainfall pattern which leads to poor yield of crops. This goes to worsen the poverty situation of the people. In order to mitigate the negative impact of this problem, the Government of Ghana and other development partners have provided some irrigation facilities in the region to ensure all-yearround farming activities so as to increase food production. The irrigation facilities are however underutilized. This study therefore set out to find the underlying causes of the underutilization. The study found among other things, the causes of underutilization to be non-adherence to the project planning stages, poor construction works, low technical capacity of agricultural extension agents, and weak management of Water User Associations. Underutilization can be curbed by involving farmers in the irrigation planning process as well as

TI  - Evaluating the impact of tax-for-fee reform (fei gai shui) on water resources and agriculture production in the Zhanghe irrigation system, China
PY  - 2008
AB  - This article questions the effectiveness and viability of rural Tax-for-Fee reform (Fei Gai Shui) on water resources and agriculture production, taking the Zhanghe Irrigation System of China as a case study example. The Fei Gai Shui reform has been heralded as a possible solution for reducing the excessive fiscal burden on peasants. While the reform may achieve in relieving peasant burdens significantly, the initial impact of Fei Gai Shui on water resources and agricultural production indicate least satisfactory trends. The policy shows significant impact on rice yield and area. It might also have profound impact on cropping pattern but it has yet to be seen. Dependence on local water resources such as ponds show significant increase after Fei Gai Shui as it discouraged farmers to rely on regional water sources. Although the lower regional water use under Fei Gai Shui reduced the water charges paid by farmers, the savings were mostly offset by increasing pumping costs in accessing water from local ponds. Without any adjustments, the Fei Gai Shui is likely to cause serious predicament in agricultural sector. It is visioned that local water resources such as water ponds will continue to play an important role in sustaining agricultural production.

TI  - Title: "Questioning the Benefits of Irrigation Development within wider Water Resources Governance and Food Security Debates in the Lower Mekong Basin"
PY  - 2014
AB  - Within the context of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), irrigation is widely accepted uncritically as a public good that has positive benefits on both poverty reduction and food security. This brings to mind, Berkoff’s (2002) sardonic remark: “Irrigation is so obviously a good thing ‐ who can be against it?” While Overseas Development Aid (ODA) from Western nations supporting irrigation development was a prevalent feature of rural development programmes in Thailand in the 1960 ‐ 90s period, it has now been replaced in that country by domestically-sourced budgets, which continue to drive forward new system developments, constantly searching for new (or recycling old) sites and water resources to exploit, even if it means importing water from transboundary sources or overallocating water supplies. In the other countries of the LMB, Western ODA is still significant and increasingly is placed within a new justifying development narrative of a “water, energy and food nexus”, alongside climate change and food/water security concerns. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that a/ irrigation has not been as beneficial to vulnerable groups or the environment as is often assumed; and b/ the older lessons of irrigation development and management in Thailand are not being applied to or assimilated within the neighbouring states. Furthermore, there appears to be an over-emphasis by those concerned with the impacts of the present hydropower construction boom on the potential risks to food security and livelihoods, that tends to overlook similar or more serious development externalities from the irrigation sector. This paper raises some of these issues and highlights some pertinent questions for water resources planners, policy makers, development practitioners and researchers to consider.

TI  - Water use efficiency and influence of management policies, analysis for the small-scale irrigation sector in South Africa
PY  - 2009
AB  - With the growing water scarcity, the need for more efficient water use has worldwide increased in importance. In addition, cost-recovery is now widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of sustainable water management. This research aims to contribute to improved water management in the small-scale irrigation sector in South Africa, which also faces these challenges. In a first analysis the economic production value of irrigation water was determined. Results show that without government subsidies on inputs, the profitability of many smallholders was low. Achieving full cost recovery therefore appears to be problematic for the current users. In the next part the concept of sub-vector efficiencies is introduced as a measure for water use efficiency. The analysis shows that smallholders fail to reach their overall technical efficiency levels when it concerns water use. Even using the current technologies the potential to reallocate irrigation water to other water demands is substantial. In a third part an innovative two-steps simulation model was developed to study the impact of water pricing. The model introduces a representation of the technology and smallholder efficiencies in a profit maximisation model. Farmers appear to be quite responsive to water charges and adjust their water use, even when the charge is relatively low. Pricing water can thus be used to provide incentives for efficiency improvement. However, the introduction of a water price is also shown to significantly decrease farm profit, particularly for smaller farms. The last part of the study investigates the impact of improving the water rights system in South Africa. Using a contingent ranking experiment the WTP of smallholders for specific interventions is estimated. The results show that farmers are prepared to pay considerably higher water prices if this is connected with advancements in the water rights system. This implies that such interventions would improve the efficiency of the small-scale irrigation sector. A higher WTP for water is also interesting in the light of the cost recovery, because it allows the government to increase water charges. In general, this research shows how economic analyses can be used to inform policy making to improve water management.

Recemment, et de maniere utile une approche par bassin versant a ete promue basee sur l'efficacite de l'irrigation effective, mettant en avant qu'il faut exprimer la production agricole a partir de l'eau consommee. Neanmoins, etant donnee la necessite de prendre en compte les specificites de la gestion et de la productivite de l'eau, un argument est developpe pour ameliorer la comprehension de l'approche classique ou «efficacite locale de l'irrigation». 13 cet article analyse qui affectent ou sont influencees par l'efficacite locale, et qui construisent l'argumentaire. Quelques unes de ces situations sont: la pertinence de l'echelle en gestion de l'eau, la separation des activites de conception, de gestion et de surveillance, la relation entre l'efficacite et la planification, et le lien entre les besoins nets, et les pertes recuperees et non recuperees. Ce papier introduit le terme d' «efficacite atteignable», et emet l'hypothese que l'efficacite de l'irrigation classique a une utilite significative parce qu'elle reflete les observations des professionnels de l'irrigation et des agriculteurs que les efficacites locales influent considerablement sur la gestion et la productivite de l'eau au sein d'un bassin versant.

TI  - Rural Infrastructure and Agricultural Output Linkages: A Study of 256 Indian Districts
PY  - 2006
AB  - The linkages between infrastructure development and sustained output growth have been documented by many global empirical studies (Aschauer, 1989; Canning, 1998; Calderon and Chong, 2004) and worldwide reviews (Sawada, 2000; ADB et al., 2005; Estache et al., 2005; Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa, 2006). Crosscountry analyses have also documented strong linkages between infrastructure and agricultural output growth. For example, using cross-sectional data for 47 less developed countries including India, Antle (1983) found a strong and positive relationship between infrastructure development and aggregate agricultural productivity. Using annual data for 58 countries Binswanger et al., (1987) reported a positive and significant correlation between road development and aggregate crop output. These views have been substantiated by many Asian studies (Ruttan, 2002; Mundlak et al., 2004). Studies from Indian settings also document evidence of positive linkages between various types of infrastructure and agricultural output growth (Antle, 1984). Rural infrastructure (both physical and institutional) such as irrigation, watershed development, rural electrification, roads, markets, credit institutions, rural literacy, agricultural research and extension, etc., together play a key role in determining the agricultural output in India. For instance, irrigation infrastructure increases the land use intensity and cropping intensity, and provides incentives to farmers to use yield increasing inputs, and thus results in higher agricultural output (Dhawan, 1988; Shah, 1993; Vaidyanathan, 1999; Narayanamoorthy and Deshpande, 2005). Rural electrification increases the energisation of pumpsets, which helps to increase the

TI  - Water, agriculture and poverty in the Niger River basin
PY  - 2010
AB  - Livelihoods in the Niger River basin rely mainly on rainfed agriculture, except in the dry extreme north. Low yields and water productivity result from low inputs, short growing seasons, dry spells, and excessive water. The overlap of traditional and modern rules impedes secure access to water and investments in agriculture by generating uncertain land tenure. Improved agriculture and water management require technical, sociological, and regulatory changes to address the wider causes of poverty. Illiteracy and poor water quality, both correlated with high infant mortality, are pressing problems. Rapidly increasing population, climatic changes and dam construction contribute to rural vulnerability.

TI  - Consumption, habit formation, and savings: Evidence from a rural household panel survey
PY  - 2018
AB  - Protecting consumption from the effects of uninsured risk is vital for rural farming households, who tend to be poor and live close to subsistence level. Income uncertainty and habit formation play important roles in the consumption and savings. Variability in weather conditions has a strong linkage with variability in agricultural income in developing countries. This study analyzes consumption and saving decisions of rural farm households in India. Using household panel data for 4 years, we estimated consumption equation accounting for habit formation under income uncertainty. Our findings suggest an evidence for habit formation among rural households. Additionally, we found that both annual and seasonal weather risks significantly influence savings among rural households. Findings from this study also suggest a robust and vibrant farm economy and that the nonfarm economy could contribute to the economic well‐being of rural farming households.

TI  - Rapid Estimation of Crop Water Stress Index on Tomato Growth.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The goal of this research is to use a WORKSWELL WIRIS AGRO R INFRARED CAMERA (WWARIC) to assess the crop water stress index (CWSIW) on tomato growth in two soil types. This normalized index (CWSI) can map water stress to prevent drought, mapping yield, and irrigation scheduling. The canopy temperature, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit were measured and used to calculate the empirical value of the CWSI based on the Idso approach (CWSIIdso). The vegetation water content (VWC) was also measured at each growth stage of tomato growth. The research was conducted as a 2 × 4 factorial experiment arranged in a Completely Randomized Block Design. The treatments imposed were two soil types: sandy loam and silt loam, with four water stress treatment levels at 70–100% FC, 60–70% FC, 50–60% FC, and 40–50% FC on the growth of tomatoes to assess the water stress. The results revealed that CWSIIdso and CWSIW proved a strong correlation in estimating the crop water status at R2 above 0.60 at each growth stage in both soil types. The fruit expansion stage showed the highest correlation at R2 = 0.8363 in sandy loam and R2 = 0.7611 in silt loam. VWC and CWSIW showed a negative relationship with a strong correlation at all the growth stages with R2 values above 0.8 at p < 0.05 in both soil types. Similarly, the CWSIW and yield also showed a negative relationship and a strong correlation with R2 values above 0.95, which indicated that increasing the CWSIW had a negative effect on the yield. However, the total marketable yield ranged from 2.02 to 6.8 kg plant−1 in sandy loam soil and 1.75 to 5.4 kg plant−1 in silty loam soil from a low to high CWSIW. The highest mean marketable yield was obtained in sandy loam soil at 70–100% FC (0.0 < CWSIW ≤ 0.25), while the least-marketable yield was obtained in silty loam soil 40–50% FC (0.75 < CWSIW ≤ 1.0); hence, it is ideal for maintaining the crop water status between 0.0 < CWSIW ≤ 0.25 for the optimum yield. These experimental results proved that the WWARIC effectively assesses the crop water stress index (CWSIW) in tomatoes for mapping the yield and irrigation scheduling.

TI  - A compact to revitalise large-scale irrigation systems using a leadership-partnership-ownership ‘theory of change’
PY  - 2016
AB  - In countries with transitional economies such as those found in South Asia, large-scale irrigation systems (LSIS) with a history of public ownership account for about 115 million ha (Mha) or approximately 45% of their total area under irrigation. In terms of the global area of irrigation (320 Mha) for all countries, LSIS are estimated at 130 Mha or 40% of irrigated land. These systems can potentially deliver significant local, regional and global benefits in terms of food, water and energy security, employment, economic growth and ecosystem services. For example, primary crop production is conservatively valued at about US$355 billion. However, efforts to enhance these benefits and reform the sector have been costly and outcomes have been underwhelming and short-lived. We propose the application of a 'theory of change' (ToC) as a foundation for promoting transformational change in large-scale irrigation centred upon a 'global irrigation compact' that promotes new forms of leadership, partnership and ownership (LPO). The compact argues that LSIS can change by switching away from the current channelling of aid finances controlled by government irrigation agencies. Instead it is for irrigators, closely partnered by private, public and NGO advisory and regulatory services, to develop strong leadership models and to find new compensatory partnerships with cities and other river basin neighbours. The paper summarises key assumptions for change in the LSIS sector including the need to initially test this change via a handful of volunteer systems. Our other key purpose is to demonstrate a ToC template by which large-scale irrigation policy can be better elaborated and discussed.

TI  - Negative impact of small-scale irrigation schemes: A case study of Central Tigray regional state, Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ethiopia is endowed with three major resources (land, water and human labor), an opportunity for intensive agriculture such as irrigation farming. Although the government of Ethiopia is implementing various small and large scale irrigations, irrigation and irrigation dams have both positive and negative consequences to the livelihoods of rural farm households. It contributes to livelihood improvement through increased income, food security, employment opportunity, social needs fulfillment and poverty reduction. However, besides its positive impacts irrigation and irrigation dams also comprise negative effects towards the living standards of the people who are living near to irrigation areas. The negative risks to public health seem to dominate the literature on the health effects of irrigation. Hence, it causes different levels of debilitation and diseases for both man and livestock. However, regardless of the positive effects, the negative impacts of irrigation are hardly ever studied. To this end, this paper is aimed to analyze the negative effects of small-scale irrigation on households’ living standard. A twostage sampling procedure was used to first select peasant associations and then sample respondents.

TI  - Ground water and climate change
PY  - 2012
AB  - As the world's largest distributed store of fresh water, ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling human adaptation to climate variability and change. The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food security will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.

TI  - Groundwater depletion and water extraction cost: some evidence from South India
PY  - 2014
AB  - From less than 6 million ha in 1950–51, groundwater-irrigated area increased to about 45 million ha in 2010–11, which is over 62% of India's net irrigated area. But the rapid development of groundwater has brought many negative outcomes for farmers. An attempt is made in this study to find out the losers and gainers of groundwater irrigation using survey data on 234 dug-well- and bore-well-owning farmers selected from two regions having different agro-economic settings in the Pudukkottai District of Tamil Nadu, a state in South India. The study shows that the dug-well- and bore-well-owning farmers had to incur a huge additional cost on account of modifications of wells in order to keep up with the falling water level. The modification cost alone accounted for about 33–48% of the real capital of bore-wells. The pumping cost of water is found to be higher for bore-wells fitted with submersible pump-sets as compared to deep bore-wells fitted with submersible pump-sets.

TI  - What Contributes to Disparity in Rural-Urban Poverty in Tamil Nadu?: A District Level Analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Eradicating world hunger and extreme poverty has been a high profile issue on the global development agenda. Yet the distribution of rural-urban poverty and the extent of its disparity remain unknown. To-date poverty has been regarded largely as a rural issue. The poverty rates are higher in the rural areas in almost all developing countries, and in aggregate terms most people still live in rural areas (World Bank, 2008). However, due to globalisation the population of even developing countries is urbanizing fast (UNDP, 2006). Would the locus of poverty move from rural to urban poverty? Would the urban share of poverty grow over time? Should future poverty reduction strategies also target urban areas? Haddad et al., (1999) compiled rural and urban poverty measures for eight countries and found that for seven of them the urban share of the total number of poor increased over time. The poor urbanise faster and this is found to be consistent with cross-sectional data for 39 countries and time series data for India covering various survey rounds spanning 1974 to 1997-98 (Ravallion, 2002). New economic opportunities in the urban areas attract rural migrants, such that urban areas act as magnets that attract poverty. To other observers, urbanisation has been seen as a new source of poverty. Although poverty in developing countries remains predominantly rural, data are lacking on the extent to which absolute poverty in the world is a rural or urban phenomenon (Ravallion et al., 2007). In this paper, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the extent of disparity in rural and urban poverty for India, with emphasis on Tamil Nadu State. The level of aggregation in most studies has been the national or Indian economy as a whole, leaving little scope for analysing the import of widening regional disparity in rural-urban poverty in India. Intra-regional disparities at the district level are hardly explicit in macro level data for the state as a whole. In particular the studies covering district-wise (sub-state level) data especially on Tamil Nadu State are almost none. The analysis on poverty using aggregate state level data may not reveal the true extent of disparity in poverty as the agro-climatic and other controlling

TI  - Determinants of Small-Scale Irrigation Use for Poverty Reduction: The Case of Offa Woreda, Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Small-scale irrigation is one of the agricultural activities used by rural farmers to improve the overall livelihood of the rural community by increasing income, securing food, meeting social requirements, and reducing poverty. The main objective of this study was to look into the factors that influence small-scale irrigation for poverty reduction among small-holder farmers in the Offa Woreda, Wolaita Zone. Government and nongovernmental organizations supplied small-scale irrigation and training to small-holder farmers in the study area at various times; however, the key determinants impacting small-scale irrigation use were not fully identified in the study area. The study location was chosen for this study purpose because no prior in-depth research had been conducted. Simple random sampling was used to select the three kebeles for the study. A total of 134 people were included in the study sample frame. The sample was chosen using simple random sampling and the proportional probability-to-size (pps) method, which was proportional to the size and used multistage sampling procedure. The primary data were collected using the interview schedule. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive and econometric analyzes in SPSS version 21. Qualitative data were also collected through focus groups and key informant interviews. A factor that influences small-scale irrigation use was investigated using a binary logistic regression model. The binary logistic regression model revealed that both the irrigation participants (37.3%) and the nonparticipant (62.7%) families had a combination of personal and demographic, economic, institutional, and social influencing factors that hinder their likelihood of using irrigation. HH age, annual income of the household, distance from the closest farm sight, farm experience, participation in training, access to irrigation, and sex of HH were positively and significantly influencing factors in the model, while total ownership of livestock of households and health status of households were negatively significant variables. As a result, the Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Office, as well as the Water Mining and Energy Offices, should devote scientific attention to the significant factors that influence irrigation use to boost farm family production and productivity.</jats:p>

TI  - Gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst smallholder Ethiopian women farmers
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Although Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can offer economic and food security opportunities for women farmers, success in the uptake of these technologies is contested by gendered constraints. Previous studies that use the household head as a unit of analysis to explain adoption patterns do not adequately demonstrate the extent to which women smallholders are restricted by gendered constraints. This study uses 344 women and men survey respondents involved in conservation agriculture (CA) and small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) as data sources for examining the effect of gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst women in three areas in Ethiopia. Qualitative and quantitative data collections were applied using survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test and binary logistic regression using statistical software for the social sciences (SPSS) version 24. Thematic and narrative analysis methods were used to analyze qualitative data. The findings show that women smallholders uptake is affected by limited access to credit, extension, restricted membership in cooperatives and water user associations, lack of access or user rights to land, skill training, information, and restricted mobility. Agricultural development interventions should be implemented by accepting and considering individual farmer's entitlement to development. Expanding off-farm diversification and rural employment opportunities through changing the land tenure system, which is currently state-owned, are essential to enhance women smallholders’ access to land and other agricultural inputs.

TI  - Importance of irrigated agriculture to the Ethiopian economy: Capturing the direct net benefits of irrigation
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study is an attempt to quantify the actual and expected contribution of irrigation to the Ethiopian economy for 2005/06 and 2009/10 cropping seasons using adjusted net gross margin analysis. After obtaining adjusted gross margin values for rain-fed and irrigation systems under different typologies, irrigation’s contribution was calculated to be about 5.7 and 2.5 percent to agricultural and overall GDP during the 2005/06 cropping season. By the year 2009/2010, irrigation’s contribution to agricultural and overall GDP is estimated to grow to about 9 and 3.7 percent, respectively. After relaxing some of the underlying assumptions, the future contribution of irrigation to agricultural GDP will rise to about 12 percent while the contribution to overall GDP will be about 4 percent. Recommendations for enhancing irrigation’s contribution and policy implications for cost recovery and sustainability of irrigation investment are drawn.

AB  - Farmers at Dotito Irrigation Scheme were trained to be successful entrepreneurs and the government encouraged them to be business minded whenever running their farming activities. These people also attend workshops on entrepreneurship skills organised by the government. Dotito Irrigation farmers were trained to manage their resources strategically. They depend on their farm produce to meet their day to day needs. The feasibility and practicability of the questionnaire was studied through the pilot test. Analysis of data was done using content analysis. The research also examined the hypothesis and has shown that strategic entrepreneurship has a significant correlation with an increase in agricultural productivity at Dotito Irrigation Scheme.

PY  - NA
AB  - Agua y produccion agraria can indisolublemente unidas. El regadio permite aumentar y estabilizar las cosechas, mejorando las rentas de los hogares rurales. En las zonas mas pobres del mundo el regadio no se ha explotado de acuerdo al potencial productivo y los rucursos existences. El mundo tiene recursos suficientes para alimentarse, pero muchos paises veran aumentada su dependencia alimentaria del exterior debido a la escasez de recursos por habitante. La expansion del regadio en el mundo se ha ralentizado en los ultimos 20 anos. El regadio, como motor de desarrollo rural y vehiculo de reduccion de la pobreza, ha cobrado importancia tras la crisis alimentaria de 2007-2008, y el posterior encarecimiento de las materias primas agrarias. La gestion del aqua y de la tierra en las regiones mas pobres precisa tanto inversiones productivas como mejoras en la gobernanza y la participacion de la mujer. Este articulo analiza estas cuestiones y trata de identificar los retos mas acuciantes para 2011-2020.

TI  - Economic effects of water use and landholding scale to farming in South Asia: evidences from Indo-Gangetic basin
PY  - NA
AB  - Water use and landholding factors are widely acknowledged as major determinants of agricultural development in agrarian regions of the Indo-Gangetic basin (IGB). High attention is mainly given to irrigation policy while land is often apprehended through soil productivity aspects. However, the nexus between land scale and water consumption in respect to the economic implications of agricultural development is poorly elaborated. To this aim, this paper examines the economic effects of water use and landholding scale to farming in agricultural communities of IGB area. The research is based on an extensive survey conducted in representative areas of Pakistan, India and Nepal situated along the IGB basin. The results signify that the economic viability of marginal and small landholders and water users is threatened when the study focuses on the land scaling effects to farming. Practical recommendations towards the rescheduling of irrigation and land use policies are introduced.

TI  - Influence of Small-scale Irrigation Schemes on Improving Livelihood of Rural Farm Households; A Case of Perkerra Irrigation Scheme, Baringo County
PY  - 2017
AB  - Irrigation contributes to livelihood improvement through increased income, food security, employment and poverty reduction. Perkera irrigation Scheme has not fully achieved its objectives as expected. The main purpose of this study was to assess the role of small-scale irrigation schemes on the livelihoods of rural farm household in Perkerra Irrigation Scheme. This study specifically identify the scheme crops and its effect on livelihood of farmers. The study randomly sampled 388 small-scale household farmers living within and around the Perkerra Irrigation Scheme. Well-structured questionnaires for the household data collection and interview guide for the scheme officials were used in the study. This research employed descriptive statistics to assess the relationship between irrigation scheme outcomes and community livelihoods. Field raw data was entered into SPSS and cleaned before analysis. The research established positive effects on the livelihoods of farmers belonging to the scheme. 312(98%) were able to provide food for their families, 308(96%) grow crops for consumption, 291(92%) able to take three meals a day together with their families and 240(75%) said that their families no longer rely on relief food. However, 187 (59%) of farmers in the scheme did not receive nutritional support for their children. Most farmers did not agree to the statement that they received seeds and fertilizer. Most respondents, 192 (60%) strongly agreed they possessed skills in farming compared to that time before the irrigation system. Farm machinery like tractors are made available to farmers in the scheme. The scheme need look into and boost social well-being of farm household as a holistic approach to rural development especially in the area of medical care and facilities.

TI  - Essays on irrigation development, farm production and unaccounted costs : theory and empirical evidence
PY  - 2010
AB  - A review of the literature related to issues involved in irrigation induced agricultural development (IIAD) reveals that: (1) the magnitude, sensitivity and distribution of social welfare of IIAD is not fully analysed; (2) the impacts of excessive pesticide use on farmers’ health are not adequately explained; (3) no analysis estimates the relationship between farm level efficiency and overuse of agro-chemical inputs under imperfect markets; and (4) the method of incorporating groundwater extraction costs is misleading. This PhD thesis investigates these issues by using primary data, along with secondary data from Sri Lanka. The overall findings of the thesis can be summarised as follows. First, the thesis demonstrates that Sri Lanka has gained a positive welfare change as a result of introducing new irrigation technology. The change in the consumer surplus is Rs.48,236 million, while the change in the producer surplus is Rs. 14,274 millions between 1970 and 2006. The results also show that the long run benefits and costs of IIAD depend critically on the magnitude of the expansion of the irrigated area, as well as the competition faced by traditional farmers (agricultural crowding out effects). The traditional sector’s ability to compete with the modern sector depends on productivity improvements, reducing production costs and future structural changes (spillover effects). Second, the thesis findings on pesticides used for agriculture show that, on average, a farmer incurs a cost of approximately Rs. 590 to 800 per month during a typical cultivation period due to exposure to pesticides. It is shown that the value of average loss in earnings per farmer for the ‘hospitalised’ sample is Rs. 475 per month, while it is approximately Rs. 345 per month for the ‘general’ farmers group during a typical cultivation season. However, the average willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid exposure to pesticides is approximately Rs. 950 and Rs. 620 for ‘hospitalised’ and ‘general’ farmers’ samples respectively. The estimated percentage contribution for WTP due to health costs, lost earnings, mitigating expenditure, and disutility are 29, 50, 5 and 16 per cent respectively for hospitalised farmers, while they are 32, 55, 8 and 5 per cent respectively for ‘general’ farmers. It is also shown that given market imperfections for most agricultural inputs, farmers are overusing pesticides with the expectation of higher future returns. This has led to an increase in inefficiency in farming practices which is not understood by the farmers. Third, it is found that various groundwater depletion studies in the economics literature have provided misleading optimal water extraction quantity levels. This is due to a failure to incorporate all production costs in the relevant models. It is only by incorporating quality changes to quantity deterioration, that it is possible to derive socially optimal levels. Empirical results clearly show that the benefits per hectare per month considering both the avoidance costs of deepening agro-wells by five feet from the existing average, as well as the avoidance costs of maintaining the water salinity level at 1.8 (mmhos/Cm), is approximately Rs. 4,350 for farmers in the Anuradhapura district and Rs. 5,600 for farmers in the Matale district.

TI  - Irrigation, Productivity and Poverty Linkages in Irrigation Systems in Java, Indonesia
PY  - 2006
AB  - This paper analyzes irrigation-poverty linkages, and determines how and to what extent irrigation contributes to poverty alleviation, and whether there are any spatial patterns in poverty in irrigation systems. It also identifies conditions under which irrigation has greater anti-poverty impacts. The analysis is based on primary data collected during the 2000--2001 agricultural year, from four selected irrigation systems and rainfed areas in Java. The results indicate that irrigation has significant poverty reducing impacts. Poverty varies across irrigation systems and across locations within the systems. In general, crop productivity is relatively higher and poverty is lower in middle parts of the systems compared to head and tail parts. Further, locational differences in poverty are more pronounced in larger systems where locational inequities in water distribution and productivity differences are also high. Crop productivity, the size of landholdings and location of households are important determinants of poverty, in addition to demographic factors such as family size. The smaller the systems with well managed infrastructure, relatively equitable water distribution and diversified cropping patterns supported with market infrastructure, the greater the poverty reducing impacts of irrigation. Overall, the study findings suggest that improving the performance of irrigation systems by enhancing land and water productivity, diversifying cropping patterns and improving water distribution across locations would help reduce poverty in presently low productivity-high poverty parts of the systems.

TI  - Developing a User-Based Decision-Aid Framework for Water Storage Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia
PY  - 2015
AB  - The development of water storage schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is considered a major aid for those regions with unequal water distribution, limited accessibility and anticipated climate change impacts. Great attention is given by many SSA countries to set up different water storage schemes that may improve rural and urban development on a national level. The funding for the water storage schemes is often derived from foreign agencies which conduct feasibility studies for the financing of potential investments. Often however, the feasibility studies rely on a single monetary criterion which may not identify the most appropriate water storage in each case. In addition, limited data availability in many SSA countries increases the difficulty of identifying the most suitable storage option. This paper develops a multicriteria framework for the integrated evaluation of water storage strategies in Sub-Saharan African countries. A set of economic, agronomic and opinion-based criteria are assessed through the PROMETHEE II outranking approach. The introduction of crop modeling complements the limited field data available in agronomic criteria and enhances the scientific rigor of the method. Ethiopia is adopted as a representative case of SSA countries where a diverse set of water storage options is currently under construction, often financed by foreign agencies.

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>This chapter presents the framework of sustainable livelihoods. The interests of this chapter derive from three issues: (1) How can one determine who in the population achieves a sustainable livelihood and who does not? That is, how does sustainable livelihood assist in eliminating poverty and reduce deprivation in rural communities? (2) What livelihood resources and institutional processes are necessary for enabling or constraining sustainable livelihoods for different groups? That is, does household livelihood help individuals or families to escape poverty? (3) What are the practical, operational, and policy implications of adopting a sustainable livelihood approach to poverty reduction? Namely, what constitutes a satisfactory basis for adopting a livelihood framework?</jats:p>

TI  - IMPLICATIONS OF RURAL IRRIGATION SCHEMES ON HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY. A CASE OF LOWER GWERU IRRIGATION SCHEME, ZIMBABWE
PY  - 2016
AB  - Rural poverty is a major challenge in most developing countries especially in Africa where the majority of people are still living below the poverty datum line. In Zimbabwe, poverty is made more severe by occasional droughts associated with climate change, climate variability and failed socio-economic-political governance. One of the ways to mitigate the impact of drought and prevent deepening poverty is the introduction of small irrigation schemes. However, there is a raging debate on the social and economic viability of these schemes on household livelihood security and income. This paper aims at investigating the socioeconomic impacts of Lower Gweru Irrigation project in Zimbabwe. A case study approach was used in this study. Primary data was gathered using self-administered questionnaire and complemented by secondary data. Results demonstrated that rural irrigation has a critical role in ensuring sustainable household and community income. Irrigators fared well regarding wealth accumulation, household food security and quality of life as measured through the use of standardised HDI. In light of the above, there is a need to fund and develop more rural irrigation schemes so as to ensure livelihood security and rural development in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on welfare and vulnerability to poverty in South African farming households
PY  - 2022
AB  - Many empirical studies have documented the role of farm management practices such as irrigation in reducing poverty and improving household well-being. Few studies, however, have looked at the impact of irrigation farming on poverty vulnerability and the welfare of rural farming household. This study examined the factors that influence farmers’ participation in irrigation farming, as well as how it affects farmers' food consumption expenditure per capita (proxy for welfare), poverty gap index, poverty severity and poverty vulnerability. The study's data was collected from farming households in the northern and coastal parts of the Eastern province of South Africa. The endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was employed in the study to account for selection bias that could be caused by both observed and unobserved household factors. The empirical result shows that gender, household size, educational attainment, crop diversification, and market outlet among others influenced farmers' decision to practice irrigation farming. Farmers engaging in irrigation farming boosted their food consumption per capita by 44%, while non-participants would have increased their consumption expenditure per capita by 23% if they had participated. Moreover, participating farmers reduced their poverty gap index by 20% and poverty severity by 22%, whereas non-participating farmers could have reduced their poverty gap index and poverty severity by 5% and 17%, respectively had they engaged in irrigation farming. Participation in irrigation farming also reduced poverty vulnerability by 25%, while non-participants may have reduced poverty vulnerability by 3%. The findings suggest that enhancing farmers' access to irrigation is crucial to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to eradicate poverty in all its manifestations everywhere.

TI  - Targeting Irrigation Expansion to Address Sustainable Development Objectives: A Regional Farm Typology Approach
PY  - 2021
AB  - Sustainable water management is a core sustainable development goal (SDG) that also contributes to other SDGs, including food and water security, ecosystem health, and climate adaptation. To achieve these synergies, policies must target efforts to regions that best correspond with development objectives. This study designs a targeting strategy for irrigation expansion in southern Mexico—a region long considered to have strong potential for sustainable irrigation development. We use an integrated farm typology and decision tree approach to identify priority municipalities for irrigation expansion. We use multivariate statistics to examine the relationships among farm characteristics in 933 municipalities, classifying each according to four farm types: lowland, midland, midland-irrigated, and highland. We then partition municipalities into 11 farm-type subgroups, each ranked by priority level for receiving irrigation interventions following Mexico’s National Water Program guidelines. Results identify a ‘highest-priority’ subgroup of 73 municipalities comprised mostly of midland and highland farm types. These types are characterized by low irrigation use, small farmland areas, high vulnerability to climate, high marginalization (poverty), strong representation from indigenous communities, low maize yield, and high rates of subsistence production. Findings provide a crucial first approximation of where irrigation expansion would best address water policy priorities and sustainable development objectives in southern Mexico. This study also provides a useful framework for scaling organizations tasked with targeting development efforts across large spatial scales.

TI  - Indonesia Rice Irrigation System: Time for Innovation
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Indonesia is likely to face a water crisis due to mismanagement of water resources, inefficient water systems, and weak institutions and regulatory organizations. In 2020, most of the fresh water in Indonesia was used for irrigation (74%) to support the agricultural sector, which occupies 30% of the total land area in Indonesia. Of all agricultural commodities, rice is one of the major and essential commodities, as it is the basic staple food for almost every Indonesian. However, in 2018, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH) reported that 46% of Indonesian irrigation infrastructure is moderately to heavily damaged. Looking at how irrigation can be very crucial to the welfare of Indonesian population, this study conducted an extensive literature review of the historical, current, and future management of irrigated rice production systems in Indonesia. This study has clearly shown that the irrigation systems in Indonesia have existed for thousands of years and, thus, there is a close relationship between irrigation and the socio-cultural life of the Indonesian population. Aside from how climate change influences water availability for irrigation, rice production with a constant water ponding system has been found to contribute to climate change, as it emits methane (CH4) and other greenhouse gases from agricultural fields of Indonesia. Therefore, the required modernization of irrigation systems in Indonesia needs to consider several factors, such as food demands for the increasing population and the impact of irrigated agriculture on global warming. Multi-stakeholders, such as the government, farmers, water user associations (WUA), and local research institutions, need to work together on the modernization of irrigation systems in Indonesia to meet the increasing food demands of the growing population and to minimize the impacts of agriculture on climate change.</jats:p>

TI  - Is Irrigation Rehabilitation Good for Poor Farmers? An Impact Evaluation of a Non-Experimental Irrigation Project in Peru
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper analyses the effect of a set of irrigation rehabilitation projects conducted over the last 10 years in Peru. The projects were conducted without the aim or the tools for a full-fledged impact evaluation. Nevertheless, this paper attempts an evaluation through the use of alternative data sources such as household surveys and geographic information, a strategy of identification of beneficiaries and control households based on spatial proximity to the projects’ sites, and an econometric approach consisting of a double-differencing technique. The empirical analysis is guided and interpreted with the help of a theoretical model that considers the effects of an irrigation project on the distribution of production, employment and income for different types of landowners. The paper concludes that the irrigation projects implemented in Peru had a positive impact on intended beneficiary households, but not in the way it could have been simplistically expected. The project did benefit the poor but not by increasing production in their own small plots but by providing them with better employment opportunities in larger farms.

TI  - Technical efficiency of sprinkler irrigation in Swaziland: a case study of the Lusip Phase 1 in Lubovane area
PY  - 2013
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the technical efficiency of sprinkler irrigation of smallholder sugarcane scheme in the Lubovane area of Swaziland in terms of design parameters, frequency of water application, adequacy of irrigation and irrigation uniformity. The study was done in Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo and Ziyanhle irrigation schemes. Data were collected from each scheme using both primary and secondary data sources between June and September 2013. Primary data included informal interviews and field measurements about operations of the schemes while secondary data included literature review and design documents. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. All the schemes were under-performing in terms of the frequency of irrigation, adequacy and irrigation uniformity. Both Imbali Yamadlenya Farmers Association (FA) and Nxutsamlo FA had their emitters discharging more water than the designed specifications while at Ziyanhle FA the discharge was below the design specification. The flow variations for Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA were 9.3%, 18.6% and -38.4% respectively. The operating pressure variations were found to be 10%, 8.6% and -40% for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The first two schemes were over-irrigated while Ziyanhle FA was under-irrigated. The farmers in all the schemes had no systematic irrigation scheduling. They used the â€œfeelâ€ method to determine soil moisture content with one irrigation pattern adopted for the entire season. The calculated CWRs were 4.1mm/day, 11.1mm/day and 1.7mm/day for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The observed basic infiltration rates for Nxutsamlo, Ziyanhle and Imbali Yamadlenya irrigation schemes were 19.8mm/h, 31.8mm/hr and 10.2mm/hr respectively which meant the soil could absorb water from the sprinklers without experiencing surface runoff. The calculated CUs for Nxutsamlo FA, Ziyanhle FA and Imbali Yamadlenya FA were 55%, 45% and 70% respectively while the DUs calculated were 33.3%, 50% and 60% for all the schemes respectively. The project management need to develop technical interventions for capacity building of the smallholder farmers to better manage their irrigation schemes in order to achieve the projectâ€™s goal of reducing poverty and improving their livelihoods and that of their communities.,WaterNet

TI  - WHY IMPACTS OF IRRIGATION ON AGRARIAN DYNAMISM AND LIVELIHOODS ARE CONTRASTING: EVIDENCE FROM EASTERN INDIAN STATES
PY  - 2014
AB  - Irrigation, agriculture, poverty and standard of living were analysed in five eastern Indian states to delineate the links and/or missing links between the standard of living scenario and performance of the irrigation and agriculture sectors. Different indices were constructed for assessment of district- wise scenarios of irrigation, agriculture, poverty and standard of living; accordingly, the majority of the districts in the eastern Indian states showed both the irrigation and agricultural scenarios at a low level, which may be attributed to the meagre groundwater-irrigated area due to the low level of groundwater development (27%) and dependence on a surface irrigation system that suffers from a low level of irrigation efficiency and intensity. Lack of an assured irrigation service has a bearing on the low productivity of the major crop paddy and food grain production. Better living conditions and less poverty were found in the districts where relatively better irrigation and agricultural performance were observed. Multiple regression revealed 60% (R 2 >0.60) variation in living conditions was predicted by the indicators of agriculture and poverty excluding the indicators of irrigation, which is attributed to the fact of lower groundwater exploitation for irrigation in most of the districts of eastern Indian states due to poor institutional and infrastructure support resulting in a lower impact of irrigation on the poverty and standard of living scenarios.

TI  - Water storage in an era of climate change: addressing the challenge of increasing rainfall variability. Blue paper
PY  - NA
AB  - Rainfall variability is a key constraint to agricultural production and economic growth in many developing countries. This is likely to be exacerbated in many places as rainfall variability is amplified (even where the total amount of rain increases) as a result of climate change. Changes in rainfall will also increase variability in groundwater recharge and river flow, thus affecting all water sources. Water storage, in its various forms, provides a mechanism for dealing with variability which, if planned and managed correctly, increases water security, agricultural productivity and adaptive capacity. As such, water storage can make an important contribution to safeguarding livelihoods and reducing rural poverty. However, ill-conceived water storage is a waste of financial resources and, rather than mitigate, may aggravate unpleasant climate change impacts. Systems that combine complementary storage options are likely to be more adaptable and acceptable than those based on a single storage type. More systematic planning and management is required to avoid the mistakes of the past and to ensure more effective and suitable storage systems for the future

TI  - Performance of Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes Under Climate Change in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review of the Evidence
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:p>Small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) in developing countries have been crucial, but the evidence about their performance has not been sufficiently analyzed. This chapter documents such evidence by reviewing and classifying the performance indicators. It also assesses literature on whether there are discernible trends in the efficiency of SSIS, identifies and classifies SSIS constraints, and characterizes various channels through which SSIS might affect poverty. Objectives are achieved via a systematic review of literature from 1990 to 2017. Results indicate a lack of standardization of irrigation performance indicators, and there is evidence that irrigation has boosted agricultural performance. Even though SSIS were associated with higher productivity than rain-fed agriculture, they performed below their full potential due to undervaluation of irrigation water by irrigation authorities, farmer characteristics, costs, institutional setups, the policy environment, and design, cultural, community, and environmental issues. SSIS are important tools for poverty reduction, and relevant policy implications are outlined. </jats:p>

TI  - Do cooperatives help the poor? Evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - NA
AB  - This paper analyzes how producer cooperatives may bene t households in rural environments. In a multi-period model I characterize the conditions that must hold so that the always poor can exit poverty when participating in cooperatives. In particular, I explore whether cooperatives help poor households to exit poverty by increasing productivity and facilitating access to modern technologies that involve xed investments (soil conservation practices and irrigation systems). I test the implications of the model using the Ethiopian Rural Household Surveys (ERHS). Results indicate that cooperatives increased productivity for households that were not poor in 1994. Furthermore, while they had a negative e ect on adoption of xed cost technologies, the had a positive e ect on adoption of pesticides and participation in agricultural extension programs. Very preliminary, all comments welcome ∗I am extremely grateful to Professors Brad Barham and Laura Schechter for their advice and guidance, and to Professor Jennifer Alix-Garcia and the participants at various research meetings at the UW-Madison AAE Department for their helpful suggestions.

TI  - Profitability in Crops Cultivation in India: Some Evidence from Cost of Cultivation Survey Data
PY  - 2013
AB  - Indian agriculture has achieved tremendous growth in production and productivity of crops after Independence. Between 1950-51 and 2009-10, production of foodgrains increased from 51 million tonnes (mt) to 233 mt, while oilseeds production increased from 5.16 mt to 29.76 mt. Similar growth has also been achieved in sugarcane, cotton, fruits, vegetables and other crops (Government of India, 2009). Per capita availability of these commodities has also increased. The increased volume of crop output, which resulted from the intensification of agriculture after the introduction of green revolution during the mid-sixties, helped to increase the wage rate and generate more employment opportunities in the rural areas particularly for the landless labourers (Dev and Ranade, 1998; Saleth, et al., 2003; Narayanamoorthy and Deshpande, 2003). The incidence of rural poverty has also reduced considerably from 56.44 per cent during 1972-73 to 28.33 per cent in 200405 mainly because of the improved production of agricultural commodities, as proved by a number of studies (Ahluwalia, 1978; Narayanamoorthy, 2001; Saleth et al., 2003; Hussain and Hanjra, 2003; 2004). These achievements would not have been possible without the incisive role of Indian farmers (Swaminathan, 2008). Despite these achievements, there are not great news from the farm sector since the early 1990s. Farmers’ suicides, indebtedness, crop failures, un-remunerative prices for crops and poor returns over cost of cultivation are the prominent features of India’s agriculture today. Farmers committing suicides were not common before the early 1990s, but it became a widespread phenomenon today in many States in India. Over two lakh farmers committed suicides in India between 1990-91 and 2009-10 and the proportion is alarmingly high in States like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (Sainath, 2010). Why is this happening in India? Is it because of poor returns from crop cultivation? Or due to failures caused by vagaries of monsoons?

TI  - On-farm adoption of irrigation technologies in two irrigated valleys in Central Chile: The effect of relative abundance of water resources
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract This paper examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys in Central Chile. Results show a low and narrow range of adoption, with only 30 % of farmers adopting technologies. Through a Latent Class Analysis, 2 types of farmers were identified, a small group comprising moderate to intensive users, and a second one consisting of the majority of farmers mostly constrained in natural capital. Furthermore, the econometric analysis indicates that education, diversification, continuous access to water, and perception of water reliability increase the adoption. Conversely, higher water-land ratios, presence of community reservoirs, and earthen canals reduce the uptake. Overall, the dominance of fruit and horticulture production, access to agricultural credits, and full irrigation of the farm are the main drivers of adoption. The latter is a critical factor, indicating a relative abundance of water resources, which, alongside contextual characteristics, discourages farmers from implementing technologies. The low adoption rate, as well as the hindering factors, will challenge public and private organizations to design and implement policies aiming to improve water reliability and management. To generate incentives and increase awareness on the scarcity of the resource in the light of the predicted reductions in water availability because of climate change will be crucial as well.
