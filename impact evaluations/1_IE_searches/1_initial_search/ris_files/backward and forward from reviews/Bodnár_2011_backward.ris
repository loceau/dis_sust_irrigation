N2  - This paper evaluates the ex post impact of adopting improved groundnut varieties on crop income and poverty in rural Uganda. The study utilizes cross-sectional data of 927 households, collected in 2006, from seven districts in Uganda. Using propensity score matching methods, we find that adopting improved groundnut varieties (technology) significantly increases crop income and reduces poverty. The positive and significant impact on crop income is consistent with the perceived role of new agricultural technologies in reducing rural poverty through increased farm household income. This study supports broader investment in agriculture research to address vital development challenges. Reaching the poor with better technologies however requires policy support for improving extension efforts, access to seeds and market outlets that simulate adoption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The recent economic downturn in Zimbabwe impoverished the majority of households. To assist vulnerable rural households improve their food security, the British Department for International Development implemented a seed relief program from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 that emphasized recycling of maize open pollinated varieties (OPV). Using data collected from 597 households in six districts in 2006, this study assesses the effectiveness of the program in terms of its targeting of beneficiaries, the flow of information from participating NGOs to beneficiaries on the need to recycle the seeds, and the level of recycling done at the end of the program. The empirical results suggest that the targeting method participating NGOs use inadvertently excludes relatively vulnerable households while including large proportions of relatively well-endowed households in the program. The choice of varieties to distribute is guided more by the ecological adaptability of available commercial seeds and less by preferences of beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that seed selection information is critical in encouraging beneficiaries to recycle distributed seed, not all of them received it. In conclusion, it may be stated that the program undoubtedly contributed to increased food productivity by vulnerable households but its overall effectiveness could have been enhanced through (i) the involvement of the beneficiaries in the choice of types of seed to be distributed, (ii) better targeting of beneficiaries, and (iii) improved information flow between NGOs and beneficiaries.

N2  - We summarize the findings of a recently completed study of the productivity impacts of international crop genetic improvement research in developing countries. Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of “modern varieties” for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions.

N2  - While the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) has been long considered a driving force behind the successes of the “Green Revolution”, no prior study has attempted to develop an aggregate estimate of the value of the CGIAR System’s impacts. However, economic ex post impact assessments have been conducted for some of the most outstanding individual innovations of the System. This study aggregates benefit estimates from specific technologies, and sets such against total investments in the CGIAR centers, so as to derive estimates for five different aggregate benefit–cost scenarios. Impact assessment has been pursued in a largely decentralized manner by individual research centers, and, as a result, methods and approaches differ among studies. Consequently, a critical review process was necessary for determining the reliability of individual impact estimates. A framework including two overarching principles for evaluating study reliability – (1) transparency and (2) demonstration of causality, as well as accordant criteria and indicators, was developed to assess individual estimates of economic impact before inclusion in scenarios of aggregate benefits. Against an aggregate investment of 7120 million 1990 US dollars, resultant benefit–cost ratios for research to date range from 1.9 to 17.3, depending on scenario. However, the true value of benefits arising from the CGIAR is probably in excess of even the upper bounds of these results, as only a small subset of System impacts have been quantified.

N2  - Risk and its consequences pose a formidable threat to poverty reduction efforts. This article reviews a plethora of community-based risk management arrangements across the developing world. These types of arrangements are garnering greater interest in light of the growing recognition of the relative prominence of household- or individual-specific idiosyncratic risk as well as the increasing shift towards community-based development funding. The article discusses potential advantages (such as targeting, cost and informational) and disadvantages (such as exclusion and inability to manage correlated risk) of these arrangements, and their implications for the design of community-based social protection programs and policies.

N2  - Between 1978 and 1984, a massive shift from collective to household agricultural production took place in China. These incremental reforms, which Deng Xiaoping called "crossing the river while feeling the rocks," eventually gave 95 percent-160 million rural Chinese families-the right to oversee household plots, leading to stunning gains in productivity.1 Despite the success of the HRS, the enhancement of property rights is an ongoing reform process. Landholders depended on tenure agreements that could be changed at any time. Rural areas did not have the same right to profit from appreciating land values as urban landholders. As cities have expanded rapidly, municipalities have requisitioned rural land and issued it to new users at urban prices much higher than that paid to the rural villages. The policy debate about the appropriate pace for strengthening rural land use rights continues. This reform, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), provided strong incentives for farmers to increase labor and improve land, since they could profit from any marketable surplus they produced. Meanwhile, the state set quotas and purchased crops, providing reliable markets for increased production. It also strongly supported farmers by managing irrigation and the agricultural extension system. The state's earlier investments in rural nonfarm infrastructure paid off under the reforms, as workers released from agriculture by the more efficient use of labor found employment in local rural industries. In the years following the property reforms, the quality of life in rural China improved dramatically: per capita rural income more than doubled from 1978 to 1984. Having examined the substance, process, and effects of the reforms, this paper asks what lessons from the reforms are relevant for other developing countries. In spite of differences among countries, some elements of the Chinese reform experience seem highly relevant to others engaged in the struggle to develop.

N2  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of agricultural interventions in improving the nutritional status of children in developing countries. Design Systematic review. Data sources Published and unpublished reports (after 1990) in English identified by searching 10 databases (Agris, Econlit, Eldis, IBSS, IDEAS, IFPRI, Jolis, PubMed, Web of Science, and World Bank), websites, previous systematic reviews, and reference lists and by contacting experts. Study selection Included studies assessed effects of agricultural interventions aiming at improving the nutritional status of children (bio-fortification, home gardens, small scale fisheries and aquaculture, dairy development, and animal husbandry and poultry development). Only studies that used a valid counterfactual analysis were included. Before/after studies and participants/non-participants comparisons affected by selection bias were excluded. Data analysis Results were analysed for four intermediate outcomes (programme participation, income, dietary diversity, and micronutrient intake) and one final outcome (prevalence of under-nutrition). Analysis was by summary tables of mean effects and by meta-analysis (for vitamin A absorption). Results The review included 23 studies, mostly evaluating home garden interventions. The studies reviewed did not report participation rates or the characteristics of participants in programmes. The interventions had a positive effect on the production of the agricultural goods promoted, but not on households’ total income. The interventions were successful in promoting the consumption of food rich in protein and micronutrients, but the effect on the overall diet of poor people remains unclear. No evidence was found of an effect on the absorption of iron, but some evidence exists of a positive effect on absorption of vitamin A. Very little evidence was found of a positive effect on the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children aged under 5. Conclusions The question posed by the review cannot be answered with any level of confidence. The data available show a poor effect of these interventions on nutritional status, but methodological weaknesses of the studies cast serious doubts on the validity of these results. More rigorous and better designed studies are needed, as well as the establishment of agreed quality standards to guide researchers in this important area.

N2  - This article analyzes international commodity price movements, assesses food policies in response to price fluctuations, and explores the food security implications of price volatility on low-income groups. It focuses specifically on measurements, causes, and consequences of recent food price trends, variability around those trends, and price spikes. Combining these three components of price dynamics shows that the variation in real prices post-2000 was substantially greater than that in the 1980s and 1990s, and was approximately equal to the extreme volatility in commodity prices that was experienced in the 1970s. Macro policy, exchange rates, and petroleum prices were important determinants of price variability over 2005–2010, highlighting the new linkages between the agriculture-energy and agriculture-finance markets that affect the world food economy today. These linkages contributed in large part to misguided expectations and uncertainty that drove prices to their peak in 2008. The article also argues that there is a long-lasting effect of price spikes on food policy around the world, often resulting in self-sufficiency policies that create even more volatility in international markets. The efforts by governments to stabilize prices frequently contribute to even greater food insecurity among poor households, most of which are in rural areas and survive on the margin of net consumption and net production. Events of 2008—and more recently in 2010—underscore the impact of price variability for food security and the need for refocused policy approaches to prevent and mitigate price spikes.

N2  - The 2008 spike in world grain prices is widely recognised to have had serious impacts on food security and poverty, but these high grain prices are commonly described as low in historical terms – an inconsistency resulting from the use of advanced- and global-economy price indices in calculating real prices. This ignores the high share of food in poor people's expenditures and the indirect effects of income growth on expenditure patterns of rich consumers. Poor consumers have not experienced the same falls in real food prices and are more vulnerable to price shocks. Different price indices must be developed to take account of differences between consumer groups.

T1  - Impact of access to land on food security and poverty: the case of Philippine agrarian reform. Land reform, land settlement and cooperatives
A1  - Guardian
Y1  - 2003///
N2  - Agrarian reform in the Philippines seeks to solve the centuries-old problem of landlessness in rural areas. Through the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) initiated in 1987, the government addressed key national goals: the promotion of equity and social justice, food security and poverty alleviation in the countryside. After over 14 years of the CARP, however, the programme is yet to be completed and is currently burdened with major issues - from opposition by landlords and lack of support from legislators, to wide gaps in fund resources. Various studies, however, have shown that agrarian reform has had a significant impact on farmer beneficiaries. Increased per capita incomes, reduced poverty incidence, higher investments in physical capital, and greater household welfare and productivity were reported, aside from social justice and peace attained in the countryside. Land redistribution alone was not enough to liberate the small farmer from poverty and ensure the success of the CARP. Support services for the agrarian reform communities became pivotal in enhancing food security and building infrastructures that promote food production, enhance community trading and increase rural household income. Despite the many serious setbacks to the CARP's full implementation, and given the positive results of the various impact studies, this article shares the view of many observers that the CARP's overall performance is positive and encouraging. It has clearly benefited a significant portion of the rural population through its various programmes intended to alleviate poverty, ensure food security, and empower people towards the overall development of the country.

N2  - The overall goal of our paper is to understand the impact that irrigation in China has had on grain production and incomes, in general, and income and poverty alleviation in poor areas, in particular. The paper seeks to meet three objectives. First, we describe the relationship among irrigation status, yields and household crop revenue. Second, we seek to understand the magnitude and nature of the effect that irrigation has on yields and crop revenue. Finally, we seek to understand the impact that irrigation has on incomes in poor areas. Our analysis shows that irrigation contributes to increases in yields for almost all crops and in income for farmers in all areas. The importance of crop income in poor areas and the strong relationship between crop revenue and irrigation provides evidence of the importance of irrigation in past and future poverty alleviation in China. We also show that in the majority of the villages that invested in new irrigation, returns are positive even after accounting for increases in capital and production costs.

N2  - This paper seeks to critically examine the conceptual linkages between the issue of land rights for women, with household food security on the one hand and gender equality on the other. After a brief analysis of shifts in both international and national policy discourse and practice in terms of control over land as vital for food security, it seeks to analyse the implications of this for gender relations. The paper argues that in a context of diversified rural livelihoods, the contribution of agricultural production to household subsistence has been declining. This trend has been reinforced by a decline in public investment, stagnant growth and fluctuating prices for agricultural products. Men have been able to access the better paid, non-farm jobs, while leaving women behind to manage agricultural production. The renewed link between production and food security in agricultural policy has however meant allowing men not to have responsibility for household food security. While a right to land for women is a positive development, it appears also to be leading to an enhancement of work burdens, without much change in terms of status or decision-making authority.

N2  - Vietnamese land-tenure policy reforms were embedded into general economic reforms (Doi Moi), enabling the country’s transition toward a market economy. Since 1998, they were implemented incrementally together with complementary instruments such as agricultural market liberalization and new economic incentives. Major steps included disentangling socialist producer cooperatives and assigning land-use rights to its former members, developing and adapting a national legal framework (Land Law), and enhancing tenure security through gender-balanced inheritable land-use certificates. In addition to promoting individualized rights, successive reforms have contributed to accelerating the agricultural transformation process by encouraging perennial crop and agroforestry systems (and thus long-term leasehold), and allowing rural land rental and land sales markets to re-emerge. During the 1990s, combined reform efforts sped up agricultural growth and industrialization, thereby enhancing food security, and combating hunger and rural poverty. Individualized rights, liberalized product and input markets, and a new entrepreneurial spirit resulted in intensified irrigated rice production, agricultural diversification, and better food quality. Although reform achievements—accompanied by policy interventions such as export quotas—are tremendous in terms of improved nutritional status and rural livelihoods, more efficient farming and agrarian structures, more secure land investment, access to collateralized credit, and poverty reduction, some challenges to consolidate reforms exist. These challenges include addressing increased urban–rural and regional income disparities, landlessness resulting from emergency land sales, misuse of local elites’ power in land allocation, and endangered “commons” through land privatization.

Attention is focused on three major effects: (a) direct tangible impact of FT arrangements on the income, welfare, and livelihoods of rural households; (b) indirect effects of fair trade for improving credit access, capital stocks, investments, and attitudes to risk; and (c) institutional implications of fair trade for farmers' organisations and externalities for local and regional employment, bargaining, and trading conditions. Although direct effects in terms of net income remain fairly modest, important benefits are found to include capitalising farmers and strengthening their organisations.

N2  - This study examines the impact of two decades of neoliberal policy reform on food production and household livelihood security in three West African countries. The rice sectors in The Gambia, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mali are scrutinized as well as cotton and its relationship to sorghum production in Mali. Although market reforms were intended to improve food production, the net result was an increasing reliance on imported rice. The vulnerability of the urban populations in The Gambia and Côte d’Ivoire became especially clear during the 2007–2008 global food crisis when world prices for rice spiked. Urban Mali was spared the worst of this crisis because the country produces more of its own rice and the poorest consumers shifted from rice to sorghum, a grain whose production increased steeply as cotton production collapsed. The findings are based on household and market surveys as well as on an analysis of national level production data.

N2  - This article documents the long-term welfare effects of household nontraditional agricultural export (NTX) adoption. We use a panel dataset that spans the period 1985–2005, and employ difference-in-differences estimation to investigate the long-term impact of nontraditional agricultural export adoption on changes in household consumption status and asset position in the Central Highlands of Guatemala. Given the heterogeneity in adoption patterns, the analysis differentiates the impact estimates based on a classification of households that takes into account the timing and duration of nontraditional agricultural export adoption. The results show that while, on average, welfare levels have improved for all households irrespective of adoption status and duration, the extent of improvement has varied across groups. Long-term adopters exhibit the smallest increase in the lapse of two decades, in spite of some early gains. Conversely, early adopters who withdrew from nontraditional agricultural export production after reaping the benefits of the boom period of the 1980s are found to have fared better and shown greater improvements in durable asset position and housing conditions than any other category.

N2  - The main focus of this book is on the causation of starvation in general and of famines in particular. The traditional analysis of famines concentrates on food supply. This is shown to be fundamentally defective—it is theoretically unsound, empirically inept, and dangerously misleading for policy. The author develops an alternative method of analysis—the ’entitlement approach’, which concentrates on ownership and exchange. Aside from developing the underlying theory, the approach is used in a number of case studies of recent famines, including the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, the Ethiopian famines of 1973 and 1974, the Bangladesh famine of 1974, and the famines in the countries of the African Sahel in the 1970s. The book also provides a general analysis of the characterization and measurement of poverty. Various approaches used in economics, sociology, and political theory are critically examined. The predominance of distributional issues, including distribution between different occupational groups, links up the problem of conceptualizing poverty with that of analysing starvation. The book contains some technical economic analysis, but the text of the book has been kept as informal as possible, so that the text is accessible to the non‐technical reader, and the main lines of reasoning and their applications to the case studies are easily followed. Technicalities and mathematical reasoning are confined to the four appendices, which (1) present a formal analysis of the notion of exchange entitlement, (2) provide illustrative models of exchange entitlement, (3) examine the problem of poverty measurement, and (4) analyse the pattern of famine mortality based on the Bengal famine of 1943.

N2  - This paper provides arguments for discussions of the role of property rights for food security and child nutrition in rural Africa. The results are drawn from a case study in the Kafue Flats of Zambia. They show that unclear jurisdictional boundaries and weak authorities facilitated re-negotiations of property rights related to natural resources in the context of the Southern African food crisis 2002–2003. Access to natural resources was skewed towards the more powerful. On average, food intake was temporarily 50% lower than the annual mean, compared to a less than 10% decrease in the lean season 2003–2004. Large inequalities existed between different clusters of villages, according to the history of immigration and ethnicity. Yet the variability was greatest within villages. Households, which reported increasing difficulties with access to natural resources, had less diversified income-generating activities, lower food intake and more children showing impaired growth. Discussions addressing the growing disparities in rural areas should focus on a realistic implementation and enforcement of property rights in context of situated local power-relations, next to the harmonization of different tenure systems related to natural resources.

N2  - Given heavy dependence on rainfed maize production, countries in East and Southern Africa must routinely cope with pronounced production and consumption volatility in their primary food staple. Typical policy responses include increased food aid flows, government commercial imports and stock releases, and tight controls on private sector trade. This paper examines recent evidence from Zambia, using a simple economic model to assess the likely impact of maize production shocks on the domestic maize price and on staple food consumption under alternative policy regimes. In addition to an array of public policy instruments, the analysis evaluates the impact of two key private sector responses in moderating food consumption volatility – private cross-border maize trade and consumer substitution of an alternate food staple (cassava) for maize. The analysis suggests that, given a favorable policy environment, private imports and increased cassava consumption together could fill roughly two-thirds of the maize consumption shortfall facing vulnerable households during drought years.

N2  - The current controversy about large-scale land acquisitions by foreign investors has put\r\nland rights issues and responsible agricultural investment more visibly back on the\r\nglobal development agenda.\r\n1 It has also raised questions regarding the world’s future\r\ndevelopment trajectory. In both respects, it has opened up important international\r\nspace for discussion on how to improve land administration systems and investment in\r\nagriculture, so that the land rights and livelihoods of smallholder farmers, pastoralists\r\nand other vulnerable groups are strengthened.\r\n‘Land grabbing’, however, is an issue of concern that is broader than foreign land\r\nacquisitions. It is important to focus on the potential threats that foreign land\r\nacquisitions pose to the land rights and livelihoods of smallholder farmers, pastoralists,\r\nindigenous communities and other vulnerable groups. But it should neither divert\r\nattention from the role being played by domestic elites and weaknesses in national land\r\nadministration systems, nor should it preclude the possibility that foreign investors\r\ncould play a constructive role in supporting smallholder farmers.\r\nThis paper aims to contribute to the current debate by reflecting on the challenges\r\nbeing faced and some of the possible responses. In particular, it focuses on various\r\nproposed principles and guidelines for promoting good land governance and\r\nresponsible investment in agriculture.

N2  - In the last decades Vietnam has become a major supplier in the world's rice market. This position is the result of the policy reforms that have been implemented in the agricultural sector. This paper assesses the impact of the liberalization policies and focuses on the spatial price differences in the domestic rice market. The results show that price patterns correlate strongly in the Mekong River Delta. Even prices in other regions are integrated with price patterns in the South. Interestingly, private traders in the Mekong Delta are only indirectly responsible for the latter result. They satisfy local demand and deal with state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In the framework of the national food security policy, the state-owned food companies ‘subsidize’ transactions between the South and the North. Moreover, the state-owned food companies still dominate export transactions. The latter issues constitute two major queries for policy makers involved in the liberalization of the rice market, as further policy measures should not jeopardize the interests of domestic rice consumers.

N2  - Bangladesh has made notable progress in achieving food security, despite extreme population pressures, limited land resources, and an agrarian structure dominated by small and tenant farmers. After two decades of sluggish performance prior to the late 1980s, the production of rice—the dominant staple food—has increased much faster than the population. The development of minor irrigation, particularly private, investment-based expansion of shallow tubewells, has contributed to this impressive performance, and was an outcome of the government’s market liberalization policy for irrigation equipment in the late 1980s. This policy promoted rapid expansion of irrigated “boro” rice farming in the dry season. The fast diffusion of boro rice in the rain-fed, low-yielding “aus” rice area contributed to accelerated growth in rice productivity, a reduction in the unit cost of production, and a decline in real rice prices. Together, these factors have been a major factor behind attainment of food security and moderately reduced poverty in Bangladesh over the last two decades.

N2  - This paper investigates the reasons for the low application of external fertilizers on farms in Kenya and Uganda. The analysis uses a large panel of household data with rich soil fertility data at the plot level. The authors control for maize seed selection and household effects by using a fixed-effects semi-parametric endogenous switching model. The results suggest that Kenyan maize farmers have applied inorganic fertilizer at the optimal level, corresponding to the high nitrogen-maize relative price, in one of the two survey years and also responded to the price change over time. In Uganda, even the low application of inorganic fertilizer is not profitable because of its high relative price. The authors conclude that policies that reduce the relative price of fertilizer could be effective in both countries, while the efficacy of policies based on improving farmers' knowledge about fertilizer use will be limited as long as the relative price of fertilizer remains high.

N2  - Using weekly price data for two sub-periods, this paper analyses how Ugandan maize markets performed in the years following agricultural market liberalisation in the early 1990s. For each time period, the extent of integration, causality among spatial locations and relative importance of spatial locations in price formation are examined. The extent of integration, defined as a set of markets that shares common long-run price information, and the causal relationships among markets have been tested within Johansen's cointegration framework. The relative importance of each market locations is examined by estimating the common trend coefficients with a dynamic vector moving average model. Results indicate that, while there has been an overall improvement in spatial price responsiveness, the northern districts, which have been in a state of insurgency since 1986, continue to lack integration with major consumption markets in the central region. Causality test results show that, compared with the 1993–4 time period, representing the early years of liberalisation, interdependence among markets has increased. Estimates of the common integrating trend suggest that public policies, such as price stabilisation, can have desired impacts by targeting a small number of locations. These results are consistent with recently conducted household and market surveys in the country.

N2  - The Green Revolution brought modern science to bear on a widening Asian food crisis in the 1960s. The speed and scale with which it solved the food problem was remarkable and unprecedented, and it contributed to a substantial reduction in poverty and the launching of broader economic growth in many Asian countries. Improved cereal varieties, fertilizers, irrigation, and modern pest control methods lay at the heart of the Green Revolution, yet it was much more than a technology fix. It also required a supporting economic and policy environment. The need for markets that could handle the surge in production and the need to educate farmers about the new technology and ensure that they had access to the inputs and receive an adequate reward to their investments, led governments across Asia to actively intervene in launching and implementing the Green Revolution. Government interventions were also important for ensuring that small farmers were included in the revolution and did not get left behind. Even with the success of the Green Revolution, there are remaining social and environmental problems that still need to be resolved and a continuing need to increase yields to meet Asias growing food needs. There is also urgent need to bring the Green Revolution in an appropriately modified form to Sub-Saharan Africa.

The analysis reveals that public spending on road infrastructure is characterised by relatively high, but regionally strongly concentrated, returns in terms of rural household welfare. This is quite in contrast to the returns to public expenditures in education, which have attributes of much wider reach but less intensity. Public investments in agriculture show results that are low in magnitude and in statistical significance, mostly due to a poor link between public expenditures in agriculture and productivity in the sector.

The comparison in both cases is with farming systems that are “organic by default.” Survey data from a large organic coffee contract farming scheme in Uganda are reported and analyzed using a standard OLS regression and a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimate of the Heckman selection model. The analysis finds that, controlling for a range of factors, there are positive revenue effects both from participation in the scheme and, more modestly, from applying organic farming techniques.

N2  - With the financial support from various development partners, Ethiopia has designed and implemented several programs to improve household food security. Yet, food insecurity is still a major challenge to several millions of people in the country and it is questionable whether the different food security programs implemented over the past years have been successful. Using a propensity score matching method to control for pre-intervention differences, this study examined the impact on household food calorie intake of an integrated food security program (IFSP), which had been implemented in Northwestern Ethiopia by two non-governmental organizations as a case study. The estimated results provide evidence that IFSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on food calorie intake. In particular, IFSP has raised physical food calorie intake by 30% among the beneficiary households. However, we also found that IFSP has differential impact depending on family size, landownership and gender of head of household. Overall, the paper provides evidence that supporting integrated food security programs is important to improve food security in rural areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Malawi's implementation of a large-scale agricultural input subsidy programme has attracted significant international interest. This paper reviews the programme from 2005/06 to 2008/09. Nationwide disbursement of heavily subsidized fertilizers and seed to large numbers of beneficiaries represents a significant logistical achievement and substantially increased national maize production and productivity, contributing to increased food availability, higher real wages, wider economic growth and poverty reduction. However, the latter years of the programme have been accompanied by high international fertilizer prices and costs and high maize prices, the latter undermining the programme's food security, poverty reduction and growth benefits for many poor Malawian farmers relying on purchased maize for substantial amounts of their staple food requirements. Estimated economic returns to the programme have been satisfactory, given other programme benefits not captured in cost—benefit analysis. With substantial reductions in both prices and subsidized volumes of fertilizers in subsequent years, there is considerable scope for building on achievements to raise programme effectiveness, efficiency and benefits. Any application of Malawi's subsidy experience to other countries should take into account the special characteristics of the Malawian maize economy and measures needed to raise programmes' effectiveness and efficiency and their contribution to sustainable development policies.

Mungbean has strengthened economies, opened up new market niches, improved health, promoted better agricultural policies, and prompted close networking at many levels to share skills and knowledge, build social capital, and enhance local capacity for research and production.

N2  - Policy makers have high expectations for the rural non-farm economy (RNFE). Given high income shares, growing employment, and frequently low capital requirements, they see the RNFE as a potential pathway out of poverty for their rural poor. Yet available evidence suggests that pro-poor rural non-farm growth does not occur automatically. For the poor to benefit from rural non-farm growth, policy makers must stimulate buoyant rural economies, with robust non-farm income growth, not simply low-productivity employment. Moreover, the poor must gain access to growing market niches. Fluid labor markets provide one important bridge linking the rural poor to growing non-farm opportunities.

N2  - Following more than a decade of seemingly inexorable increases in the number of undernourished people, estimates for 2010 presented in this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World show a glimmer of hope, with the first fall since 1995. But that still leaves nearly a billion people going hungry, and is it too early to know if this is the beginning of downward trend or merely a momentary dip in the number of undernourished. This edition focuses on a particular group of countries in protracted crisis where levels of undernourishment are estimated to be at almost at 40 percent. The report highlights actions that can be taken to rationalize the way protracted crises are handled. As this edition of SOFI 2010 shows, there are many challenges facing countries in protracted crisis; but they are not insurmountable - there is hope. Through improved understanding of the nature of protracted crisis comes the ability to respond more effectively.

N2  - Among South Asian countries, Nepal liberalized most extensively during the 1980s and 1990s on both domestic and external fronts. In South Asia, Nepal has the lowest per capita income, highest dependence of population on agriculture and second highest poverty rate. At the same time, Nepal has the lowest average tariffs in South Asia and has taken several steps to downsize its public food distribution system and remove a host of agricultural subsidies. The outcomes from these policy reforms in Nepal are mixed. Aggregate indicators of food sufficiency and security (per capita food availability, extent of malnourishment) show improvement in Nepal since liberalization. Relative to other South Asian countries, Nepal is doing better on some indicators, like extent of undernourished population, while on other indicators, like stunting of children, Nepal is actually doing the worst. More importantly, the gains from liberalization across regions in Nepal have been uneven. The reason for such an uneven outcome is lack of complementary policies from the government that would lead to spatial integration of markets (e.g. the creation of physical and marketing infrastructure). Liberalization has in effect reinforced the ex-ante hierarchy across regions in Nepal. The paper then reviews the role and reform of the Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) within this broader context.

N2  - During the 1990s, the Government of Zimbabwe implemented an Agricultural Recovery Programme to help smallholder farmers recover from repeated severe droughts. The programme aimed to provide drought-affected smallholders with crop packs (free seeds and fertiliser) and mechanised tillage services. This article evaluates the coverage, poverty-sensitivity and impact of the programme using a more in-depth analysis of household survey data than has been done to date. The programme’s tillage component was unsuccessful, repeatedly reaching less than 5% of its target group; the crop pack component, however, reached four-fifths or more of its target group. Most of the poorer households received crop packs, but richer households were slightly more likely to get them. Those who did receive crop packs planted larger areas under staple crops, regardless of their poverty status. These findings are generally robust for a range of poverty proxies. Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence on the impact, if any, of crop packs on grain yields. Crop packs—properly attuned to local agro-ecological conditions—may serve a useful role in post-drought recovery. Steps must be taken, however, to ensure that all the poor receive crop packs. Attempts by government to provide mechanised tillage to hundreds of thousands of smallholder households are not recommended.

We considered impacts on income, savings, expenditure, and the accumulation of assets, as well as non-financial outcomes including health, nutrition, food security, education, child labor, women’s empowerment, housing, job creation, and social cohesion. The available evidence shows that microfinance does harm, as well as good, to the livelihoods of the poor.

N2  - The final evaluation of the LOL Food for Peace Dairy DAP among vulnerable Zambian smallholder farmers extended over a period of several months, beginning in mid-June, and extending through December 2008. Beginning with a pre-planning period, preparation of the survey protocol, and quantitative survey instrument design and pre-testing, a final quantitative survey was undertaken by the LOL field team in August/September. This was subsequently followed by four weeks in September 2008, when the lead evaluation consultant worked with the program team in Zambia. More than half of this period was spent meeting individually and in groups with the direct beneficiaries of the program in four provinces, meeting with the managers of the milk collection centers and observing daily activities. The consultant also spent some time with private sector processors who are now purchasing increasing volumes of smallholder dairy producer milk. The LOL field team completed data entry and initial tabulation of the quantitative survey by late November. These data, considered along with information gathered in the field by the consultant were used to develop the current final evaluation report. This project represents the first dairy project FFP has ever contracted with Land O’Lakes - an organization that is not an NGO. Here a different approach was tested to lifting vulnerable rural households out of the recurrent cycles of need for food assistance and socio-economic government support to economic self-sufficiency.

In this paper we present from survey results the impact of new, improved varieties on food security of farmers who had previously participated in PVS or CBSP, or both. A total of 230 households from eight locations, representing different social classes (A, B, C), castes (Dalit, Janajati, BCTN; referring to Bahun, Chhetry, Thakuri and Newar) and gender (male- or female-headed households) were randomly surveyed to assess changes in household food security after the adoption of improved varieties. Use of improved varieties, on average, increased production by 50%, compared to the existing local cultivars (2.4 t ha−1) and this was reflected in the improvement of food security by 1.6 months (24% increase) in the year for all farmers. Food security for male-headed households increased from 7.4 to 9.1 months and for female-headed households from 6.4 to 7.9 months (by 23% in both). The average food security of all castes improved by 23%–31% but the increased food availability of the underprivileged castes of Dalits (from 5.1 to 6.4 months) and Janjati (from 5.8 to 7.6 months) from lower food security levels is more important than that for BCTN (from 7.5 to 9.2 months). Similarly, food deficit households (C and B) had higher food availability over the food surplus households (A). The results indicate that the targeted participatory approach can reverse the findings of past maize research and development efforts which benefited only the elite farmers.

T1  - An Impact Evaluation of Land Titles on Rural Households in Peru

N2  - Abstract: Property rights are seen as a prerequisite for economic development and poverty reduction essentially because improvements in land rights are assumed to reduce the risk expropriation, increase the possibilities of trade of land, and reduce credit rationing. If property rights are not clear there is a significant risk of expropriation which acts like a random tax on returns of investment affecting the level of investment as well as the composition of the investment. Moreover improvements of rights act as reductions in transaction cost and therefore also increase the probability of trading land. Similarly, in competitive credit markets titling encourages lenders to recognize land as collateral reducing the risk premium on lending and hence reducing the restrictions to access and interest rate faced by the poor borrowers. In credit markets with imperfections collateral can reduce agency problems and therefore improve access to credit. The Peruvian rural titling program, PETT, distributed property titles to over 1.1 million rural households, and is possibly one of the largest formalization program targeted to rural areas in the developing world, provides a dramatic natural experiment for testing the channels through which the titles can impact households welfare. This paper conducts an evaluation of the impact over households of having access to a PET title on the reduction of risk of expropriation, gains from trade of land, credit access, including the likelihood of obtaining formal credit, and provision of public goods at the level of the neighborhood. Because the quasi-random program implementation in large measure breaks the link between title acquisition and the variables behind the four channels of impact identified (investment in the household or plot, trade in land, credit demand, and provision of public goods), we are able to construct plausible comparison groups in program and non-program regions via propensity score techniques and use kernel-based matching to estimate the average treatment effect of government property titling. This paper develops a unique new dataset for all rural Peru, which is also a full panel for the LSMS 2000 and partial panel with LSMS 1997. Our results shed light and yield useful insights on the potential impact of titling efforts on investment, security, financial market integration and the provision of local public goods in poor rural communities of Peru.

N2  - As the world approaches the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – which include a goal of reducing the proportion of hungry people by half – the 2010 Global Hunger Index (GHI) offers a useful and multidimensional overview of global hunger. The 2010 GHI shows some improvement over the 1990 GHI, falling by almost one-quarter. Nonetheless, the index for hunger in the world remains at a level characterized as “serious.” The result is unsurprising given that the overall number of hungry people surpassed 1 billion in 2009, even though it decreased to 925 million in 2010, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The highest regional GHI scores are for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, but South Asia has made much more progress since 1990. In South Asia, the low nutritional, educational, and social status of women is among the major factors that contribute to a high prevalence of underweight in children under five. In contrast, in Sub-Saharan Africa, low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV and AIDS are among the major factors that lead to high child mortality and a high proportion of people who cannot meet their calorie requirements. Some countries achieved significant absolute progress in improving their GHI. Between the 1990 GHI and the 2010 GHI, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam saw the largest improvements. Twenty-nine countries still have levels of hunger that are “extremely alarming” or “alarming.” The countries with “extremely alarming” 2010 GHI scores – Burundi, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Eritrea – are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the countries with “alarming” GHI scores are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The largest deterioration in GHI scores was seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, largely because of conflict and political instability. Economic performance and hunger are inversely correlated. Countries with high levels of gross national income (GNI) per capita, an important measure of economic performance, tend to have low 2010 GHI scores, and countries with low levels of GNI per capita tend to have high GHI scores. These relationships do not always hold, however. Conflict, disease, inequality, poor governance, and gender discrimination are factors that can push a country’s level of hunger higher than what would be expected based on its income. In contrast, pro-poor economic growth, strong agricultural performance, and increasing gender equity can reduce hunger below what would be expected based on income. The high prevalence of child undernutrition is a major contributor to persistent hunger. Globally, the biggest contributor to the world GHI score is child underweight. Although the percentage of underweight in children under the age of five is only one of three elements in the GHI, it accounts for nearly half of the world GHI score. Child undernutrition is not spread evenly across the globe, but instead is concentrated in a few countries and regions. More than 90 percent of the world’s stunted children (children whose height is low for their age) live in Africa and Asia, where rates of stunting are 40 percent and 36 percent respectively. To improve their GHI scores, countries need to accelerate progress in reducing child undernutrition. Recent evidence shows that the window of opportunity for improving child nutrition spans the period from -9 to +24 months (that is, the 1,000 days between conception and a child’s second birthday). This is the period when children are in greatest need of adequate amounts of nutritious food, preventive and curative health care, and age-appropriate care practices for healthy development and when interventions are most likely to prevent undernutrition from setting in. After age two, the effects of undernutrition are largely irreversible. To reduce child undernutrition, governments should invest in effective nutrition interventions targeted to mothers and children during the window of opportunity. These interventions should focus on improving maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation, promoting sound breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, providing essential micronutrients, and adopting salt iodization, while also ensuring appropriate immunization. Achieving high coverage of these interventions could have a rapid impact on improving early childhood nutrition. Governments should also adopt policies that deal more broadly with the underlying causes of undernutrition such as food insecurity, lack of access to health services, and poor caring and feeding practices, which are exacerbated by poverty and gender inequity. Poverty-reduction strategies focused on reducing inequities are therefore part of the solution for improving early childhood nutrition, as are policies specifically aimed at improving the health, nutrition, and social status of girls and women.

N2  - At the turn of the millennium, irrigated land made up about a fifth of the arable area in developing countries, having doubled to about 200 million hectares since the early 1960s. Yet, this relatively small proportion of arable land produced 40 percent of all crops and close to 60 percent of cereal crops—but it also accounted for about 80 percent of all water use in developing countries. As the world’s popula- tion expands from its present 6.5 billion to a projected 8.2 billion in 2030, demand for agricultural production and, thus, water will increase. Increased attention to efficient water management will be essential to meeting that demand. Globally, water is an increasingly scarce commodity—in the next 25 years more than a quarter of the developing world population will face severe water scarcity. The rapidly growing numbers of urban and industrial consumers will be prepared to pay more for water than the agricultural sector at present.

N2  - The world's demand for food is expected to double within the next 50 years, while the natural resources that sustain agriculture will become increasingly scarce, degraded, and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In many poor countries, agriculture accounts for at least 40 percent of GDP and 80 percent of employment. At the same time, about 70 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas and most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.World Development Report 2008 seeks to assess where, when, and how agriculture can be an effective instrument for economic development, especially development that favors the poor. It examines several broad questions:How has agriculture changed in developing countries in the past 20 years? What are the important new challenges and opportunities for agriculture? Which new sources of agricultural growth can be captured cost effectively in particular in poor countries with large agricultural sectors as in Africa? How can agricultural growth be made more effective for poverty reduction? How can governments facilitate the transition of large populations out of agriculture, without simply transferring the burden of rural poverty to urban areas? How can the natural resource endowment for agriculture be protected? How can agriculture's negative environmental effects be contained? This year's report marks the 30th year the World Bank has been publishing the World Development Report.

N2  - Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50%, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

N2  - Pest populations of the cassava mealybug Phenacoccus manihotiMat.-Ferr. (Homoptera; Pseudococcidae) were reduced successfully by the biological control agent Apoanagyrus (Epidinocarsis) lopezi De Santis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. The economics of the project were evaluated based on data from field trials, socio-economic surveys, published results, and financial information provided by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the national programmes. Costs and benefits for the biological control of P. manihoti were calculated over 40 years (1974–2013) for 27 African countries, for four different scenarios, taking into account that impact by A. lopeziand speed of the impact differ between ecological zones. A reasonable calculation considering compounded interest resulted in a benefit cost ratio of about 200 when cassava was costed at world market prices, and of about 370–740 when inter-African prices were considered.

N2  - This paper constructs a baseline and pursues an overall impact evaluation of the PETT (Programa Especial de Titulación de Tierras), an ambitious rural titling program created in Peru in 1992. The general evaluation of impacts on farmers shows a picture of not many positive effects, at least in the short period of the evaluation (2004-2006) and for a limited sample of farmers located in the Coast and Sierra regions. On average, most income variables (and income composition) do not seem to be impacted by titling, and there are no detectable effects on investments (except for permanent pasture in the Sierra) or other outcome variables, such as credit, land markets, or land conflicts. However, this general picture hides important impacts that may occur for some groups of farmers, or for farmers facing different constraints in the pre-intervention stage. Given the limitations, we investigated in more detail two important channels that are behind the potential impacts of rural titling programs: credit access and use of land rental markets.

N2  - This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of phases I and II of the twophase, 11-year Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Program (KAPP). A planned third phase of the APL did not materialize. The two projects in phases I and II were approved by the World Bank’s Executive Board on June 17, 2004, and June 11, 2009, respectively. Agriculture (including crops, livestock, and fish) is the key sector for economic growth and poverty reduction in Kenya. It plays a pivotal role in employment creation, food security, exports, and sustainable development. However, in the early 2000s the Kenyan economy and the agricultural sector were performing poorly, with declining productivity and competitiveness, and growing poverty and food insecurity. Multiple underlying factors were behind such poor performance: pervasive governance problems, weak infrastructure and economic services, domestic policy shortcomings, and legal and regulatory constraints. The government of Kenya developed a new strategy to reverse those trends and revitalize the economy. The Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS; 2003–07) identified agriculture, trade and industry, and tourism as the key sectors to drive the recovery process and contribute to improving food security and reduce rural poverty. It was followed by launching the Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture (SRA) to provide an enabling environment for increasing agricultural productivity, promoting investments, and encouraging private sector involvement in agriculture. The long-term objective of KAPP, as stated in the project appraisal document was to contribute to a sustainable increase in Kenya’s agricultural productivity and improvement of the livelihoods of its rural communities.” This overarching objective was expected to be achieved through improved performance of the agricultural technology supply and demand system by means of a phased APL with an initial design of 12 years, over three phases, which would be financed by a combination of credits and grants from the International Development Association. The two phases of KAPP, eventually implemented over 11 years, was the main support the World Bank provided to the agriculture sector in Kenya from 2004 through 2015.

N2  - This report focuses on growing trade in food staples in the Southern and Eastern African region of Africa as one of the largest growth opportunities available to African farmers. This paper examines the impact of regional trade in food staples, both for maintaining farmer incentives in surplus food production zones and for moderating price spikes in deficit areas. The paper begins by identifying the geographic extent of major maize market sheds in Eastern and Southern Africa. It then focuses on the South Eastern Africa market shed, the one centered in Malawi, Northern Mozambique and Zambia. This analysis concentrates on the regions two most important food staples, maize and cassava. Given the volatility of the region's rainfed maize production, this section aims to empirically evaluate the impact of maize production shocks on staple food prices, production incentives, consumption and trade. To do so, the paper develops a spatially disaggregated model o f maize and cassava markets in order to evaluate the impact of supply shocks, with and without cross-border trade.

N2  - Irrigation has made a major contribution to poverty reduction in the past decades, enabling higher yields and better nutrition. Despite these achievements, large-scale irrigation schemes have usually yielded low returns and attracted negative publicity because of their adverse environmental and social impacts. As a result, the Bank has largely switched its support for irrigation away from new construction toward rehabilitation and policy reform. This evaluation supports the need for reform but shows that there are substantial benefits from further investment in infrastructure. This study analyzes these issues through an impact evaluation of one of the last "old generation" of projects in which the Bank directly supported creation of a new irrigation scheme: India's Second and Third Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Projects (AP II and AP III). Together these projects created a new command area, the Srisailem Right Branch Canal (SRBC), and rehabilitated an existing one that had been constructed with Bank assistance, the Sriramasagar Project.

The projects were simultaneously approved in June 1995 along with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy. At that time, Ethiopia was strugghg to rebuild itself after nearly two decades of Mamist rule, a civil war, and a series of droughts. Ethiopia had only a rudimentary institutional framework, a very limited private sector, and at all levels of governance, a marked lack of experience in modem economic and technical management. Poverty was, and remains, extreme. One of the poorest countries in the world, Ethiopia’s per capita GDP is just $150 per year, and is growing at only 1.5 percent per year. Such slow growth is not enough for the country to emerge from its poverty trap. About 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas and the population of some 70 million is growing rapidly-at about 2 percent per year - and, if unchecked, would double by the mid-2040s (2006 CAS).

N2  - This book presents the results of a series of 15 country case studies conducted by FAO to explore the experience with agricultural trade-related reforms and food security. The coverage included countries at different stages of development with the main focus on low-income countries that are likely to be at greater risk of food insecurity. The purpose of this analysis was forward looking: to draw lessons from past policy reform processes at the country level in order to inform future national and multilateral policy reform efforts about likely implications for food security. The results of this study suggest that, particularly for countries at earlier levels of development, trade reform can be damaging to food security in the short to medium term if it is introduced without a policy package designed to offset the negative effects of liberalization. Part 1 is a synthesis of the case study findings, while Part 2 presents the individual country case studies.\n

N2  - A farmer-managed, agroenvironmental transformation has occurred over the past three decades in the West African Sahel, enabling both land rehabilitation and agricultural intensification to support a dense and growing population. This paper traces the technical and institutional innovations, their impacts, and lessons learned from two successful examples. The first is the story of the improvement and replication of indigenous soil and water conservation practices across the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. Rehabilitation of at least 200,000 hectares of degraded land enabled farmers to grow cereals on land that had been barren and intensify production through developing agroforestry systems. Additionally, rehabilitation appears to have recharged local wells. The second example is a farmer-managed process of natural regeneration, using improved, local agroforestry practices over an estimated 5 million hectares in southern Niger. This large-scale effort reduced wind erosion and increased the production and marketing of crops, fodder, firewood, fruit, and other products. In both cases, income opportunities were created, reducing incentives for migration. Women benefited from the improved supply of water, fuelwood, and other tree products. Human, social, and political capital was strengthened in a process of farmer-driven change. Fluid coalitions of actors expanded the scale of the transformation. These stories have important lessons for those who seek to create effective agricultural development partnerships and meet the challenges of climate change and food security.

N2  - This case study explores the development, dissemination, adoption, and impact of improved tree fallows in rural western Kenya. The processes of technology development and dissemination throughout the region are described and analysed using a variety of data collection methods as well as samples from both pilot areas where researchers maintained a significant presence and non-pilot areas where farmers learned of the technologies through other channels. Sample sizes for the quantitative analysis ranged from almost 2000 households for measuring the adoption process to just over 100 households for measuring impact indicators. Qualitative methods included long-term case studies for 40 households and focus group discussions involving 16 different groups. The paper describes the ways in which farmers used and modified improved fallow practices. It also examines the types of households using fallows and benefiting from their use. Empirical results suggest that improved fallows almost always double on-farm maize yields. In addition, the data indicates that poor households use improved fallows at a much greater rate (about 30%) than they do fertilizer (8%), though, on average, the size of fallow plots remains small, at 440 m2. As a result, despite these promising signs, the improved fallow systems were not found to be linked to improved household level food security or poverty indicators, primarily because the size of the fields under the agroforestry systems was on average, quite small. It is concluded that improved fallows represent a technically effective and financially profitable technology that is attractive to poor households with little cash available for investment. They are being used and adopted by a significant proportion of households in areas of western Kenya where they had been disseminated in the late 1990s. However, farm sizes are small and the ability of farmers to set aside land, even for a season is limited. Hence, the average size of improved fallow is small among adopting farmers.

N2  - This paper attempts to assess the impact of trade liberalization on growth, poverty, and food security in India with the help of a national-level computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth and income-poverty reduction projected to occur following trade liberalization do not necessarily improve the food security and/or nutritional status of the poor. Evidence from simulations of (partial) trade reforms reflecting a possible Doha-like scenario show that the bottom 30 percent of the population in both rural and urban areas would suffer a decline in calorie and protein intake, in contrast to the rest of the population, even as all households increase their intake of fats. The food security nutritional status outcome with regard to individual nutrients depends crucially on movements in the relative prices of different commodities along with changes in income levels. These results show that trade policy analysis should consider indicators of food security in addition to the overall growth and poverty measures traditionally considered in such studies.

N2  - The introduction of agricultural reforms has debatable effects on food security in developing countries. This research investigates how such effects influenced maize supply in two developing countries which were among the first to introduce agricultural reforms. Conclusions from the research suggest that agricultural reforms led to mixed results. This may be attributed to the sometimes stop-go nature of reform implementation. The mixed results are reflected in the weak maize output response to price changes. Overall country economic conditions, state of agricultural development can be attributed to the pace of response, hence effect on agricultural supply. Elasticity of maize output to changes in price and acreage are strongly significant in maize output for the case of Kenya. Both restricted models of maize production suggest that prior to the introduction of reforms acreage, prices and alternative crops were more elastic when simulated with Zambian data than with Kenyan data.

N2  - Maize and cassava are the staple food crops in Mozambique. Drought is the main source of production instability in maize. Cassava is widely touted as being drought resistant but disease exacts a heavy, often hidden, toll on edible production. In the lowland coastal regions of Central and Northern Mozambique, Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) is the most important source of biotic stress. Compared to drought, CBSD is unlikely to make headlines because damage is chronic and does not appear to fluctuate sharply from year to year, damaged production does not enter the market, and the yield consequences of infection are not transparent. Yet brown streak annually costs poor cassava-consuming households in Mozambique tens of millions of dollars in damaged production and foregone consumption. Brown streak is a problem that can be addressed by effective agricultural research and extension. Indeed, a partial solution to brown streak can be found in the region in the form of several sweet varieties that succumb to the disease but do not express root symptoms. The economic impact of these so-called tolerant varieties is the subject of this paper. We assess the impact of a focused five-year effort to multiply and distribute the tolerant-variety Nikwaha by the USAID-funded NGO Save the Children and its partners in six districts in coastal Nampula Province. Among the countries of the region affected by brown streak, such a concentrated program to combat CBSD via tolerant cultivars is only found in Mozambique. The analysis of the economic impact of Nikwaha is based on two data sources: the national rural household surveys in 2002 and 2003, and field- and household-level surveys conducted by Save the Children in participating communities. Although not providing definitive evidence, the national survey data attested to the potential for brown streak to adversely affect food security. The national survey data also pointed to a paucity of effective options to adjust to risk of CBSD which affected (an astonishing) 57% of the roots sampled over four years in the Save the Children field surveys. The demand for Nikwaha is strong because it tolerates root damage and scores favorably on consumption characteristics. Based on comprehensive field-survey data and conservative assumptions, the economic superiority of Nikwaha is reckoned at 25% per plant which is equivalent to about $70 per hectare at a median planting density of 3,000 plants. The Nikwaha project by Save the Children and its partners is projected to generate a 75% rate of return on investment and a total economic impact between 29 and 65 million USD in net present value. By the end of 2006, about 100,000 rural households are expected to have benefited from the project which started in 2002. The economic impact of this project is very high even in comparison to other successful agricultural research and extension projects for which the modal rate of return is between 40% to 60%. The project quickly identified a solution that addressed a major problem. Such a high rate of return epitomizes research that borrows technology with limited adaptation and testing. Both serendipity in finding a solution and focus on getting material to farmers played major roles in making the project a success. These high expected returns point to the potential for replicating two to three extension projects of similar intensity and recommendation domain in Mozambique. Other countries afflicted with brown streak in southern and East Africa should consider investing in similar propagation projects patterned after the Save the Children experience. A A sensitivity analysis shows that the projected rate of adoption is the parameter that conditions the results of our cost-benefit analysis. Survey responses suggest that the early acceptance of Nikwaha is strong, but more research is needed to determine the coverage of Nikwaha. In particular, the extent of adoption is projected to be about 15% in 2006. Determining the accuracy of this prediction will tell us a lot about the size of economic impact. Knowledge about the rate of return on this relatively low-cost investment is more certain. Even a low adoption performance of 15% by 2015 generates a rate of return on investment approaching 50%.

N2  - The importance of reviewing the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) became starkly apparent to the Independent Reviw Panel in 2008 as food prices soared. World leaders called for rapid action to stem the effects of food price inflation as 100 million people were pushed into poverty and the ranks of the 800 million already suffering hunger began to swell. As trade barriers on rice and other food commodities were resurrected and food price protests hit many developing countries, the world community was reminded of the importance of food security to economic and political stability. The questions posed to the Panel by the CGIAR membership became compelling.

In this context, the contributions made by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and its partners (principally, national agricultural research systems (NARS)) in the region to benefits generated for farmers, consumers, and the environment, are often overshadowed by negative or stagnant overall trends. As a result, this analysis attempts to identify, assess, and synthesize available evidence on the impact of agricultural research, so as to offer a systematic answer to the question: “Have the investments made by CGIAR–NARS in SSA been justified by documented benefits to date?”

N2  - Like other West African cotton producers, Burkina Faso’s cotton strategy has traditionally involved substantial government intervention in both input and output markets. Despite some notable successes, this state-led strategy had become widely criticized by the late 1980s for inefficiencies, inequities, and for inducing macro-economic instability. However, Burkina Faso rejected both the status quo and wholesale liberalization paths, and instead embarked on a more gradual and sequenced reform path that included strengthening farmers’ groups before partially liberalizing input and output markets. Although these reforms have coincided with Burkina Faso becoming the largest cotton exporter in Africa, this paper more rigorously assesses the success of these reforms through both descriptive evidence and a counterfactual analysis of what might have happened if the prereform status quo had continued. We conclude that the reforms were highly successful in terms of production growth, job creation, and in improving nutrition and poverty reduction among cotton producers. However, we also consider important caveats. Partly by design, the reforms were less successful at raising yields, stimulating development in the broader economy, or addressing environmental concerns. The more damaging criticism that the reforms have proved financially unsustainable is also considered. Without being apologist, we argue that the new institutions created under the cotton reforms at least provide a deliberative forum for successfully addressing the problem. A key challenge for the near future will be to ensure that the key institutions in this forum – particularly the farmers union and the former parastatal – are made more accountable to farmers and other key actors in the cotton sectors.

N2  - Agro-food standards, including those relating to product quality, food safety, and the environmental and social impacts of production, have become the focus of intense controversy among those concerned with African trade and the potential of establishing linkages that enable smallholder farmers to produce for higher value agro-food markets. Two divergent and very outspoken perspectives have come to dominate the issue. One of them casts standards in a negative light, as barriers to market access that effectively exclude large numbers of African smallholders and small enterprises who are unable to meet the requirements of markets for higher value goods. Overall, there is evidence of ongoing learning with adjustments being made in the foci and design of recent programs. Making the grade: smallholder farmers, emerging standards, and development assistance programs in Africa examines the emergence, varied forms, efficacy, and emerging operational lessons of these development assistance programs centered upon African smallholders and compliance with agro-food standards.

N2  - This case study builds on an ongoing large-scale quantitative research project undertaken by BIDS/IRRI since 1987 originally in 64 unions from 57 districts of the country. It adds a qualitative research component to examine the impact of modern rice varieties (MVs) on livelihoods in a structured sample of eight of these villages across a range of favorable and unfavorable contexts..... The quantitative research shows that for households with access to land there have been direct adoption impacts in the form of increased yields and higher profits. However, since rice now only represents around 20 percent of most households’ overall income, nonagricultural income is found to have gained dramatically in importance for rural households. While the profitability has declined over time, rice contributes to improved food security and provides a “springboard” for both rich and poor farm households moving into nonfarm income generation and employment... The qualitative research component generally confirmed these general findings, highlighting other factors such as the improved status associated with fixed-rent tenancy and “contract” labor arrangements. The qualitative research also shows negative adoption impacts such as shrinking common property resources (wild fish, vegetables, etc., and declining soil fertility, both of which may increase the long-term vulnerability of the poor. It also throws light on the processes of technology dissemination.... It was found that the linking of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies was useful in (a) generating complementary data of different kinds on similar issues and (b) generating new data missed within a purely quantitative approach. The sustainable livelihoods framework was a useful, flexible tool for structuring the qualitative data collection and analysis. However, the research study as a whole was limited by the fact that the qualitative component was “bolted onto” a quantitative study already underway. Therefore the framework, and the various data collection methodologies, were not systematically integrated across both components of the study. In conclusion, future agricultural research on rice may need to further address the question of MV adoption potential on risk-prone lands, the relevance of existing technology dissemination systems, the relationship between MV adoption and crop diversification, and the challenges of more sustainable crop management techniques

N2  - This study focuses on the role played by cooperative organizations in linking Ethiopian smallholder farmers to emerging supply chains and exchange networks. Three issues are addressed: (i) the trends and challenges in the Ethiopian agri-food market; (ii) the impact of collective action for the competitiveness of Ethiopian farmers; and (iii) how the competitiveness of Ethiopian rural cooperatives can be promoted. Research objectives are pursued in 5 analytical chapters based on different datasets. Using household survey data collected in 2005, the analysis in chapter 2 suggests that cooperative membership does not have an impact on agri-commodity (teff, maize, wheat, sesame, and coffee) commercialization. Only cooperatives that engage in collective marketing activities appear to have a significant and positive impact on smallholder commercialization. Using a sample of 200 agricultural cooperatives from the Ethiopian Highlands, the analysis in chapter 3 suggests that collective marketing activities face cyclical challenges related to increasing competition, and that the average cooperative is an unsustainable form of business organization. Based on data from 200 consumers in Addis Ababa, the analysis in chapter 4 shows that dairy value chains led by modern industries and supermarkets are still scare in Ethiopia, but are gaining market share as urbanization and incomes increase. Using bio-economic data in the major Ethiopian milk-shed, the analysis in chapter 5 suggests that membership in marketing cooperatives can have a positive impact on smallholder milk production and productivity, no effect on milk hygiene and a negative impact on milk nutritional value. Using a large bio-economic dataset from the Ethiopian Highlands, chapter 6 presents practical recommendations to optimize milk quality and safety in national dairy marketing cooperatives, so that Ethiopian smallholder farmers can better compete in the marketplace. Chapter 7 discusses the main findings, analysing in particular the determinants of farmer competitiveness within the cooperative framework.

N2  - This paper reviews the success of zero-tillage wheat in the rice-wheat systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Diffusion of the zero- tillage technology increased in the last decade, particularly in northwest India. In 2008, in India alone, the aggregate area in zero- or reduced- tillage wheat amounted to 1.76 million hectares, and it was used by 620,000 farmers. Zero-tillage wheat allows for a drastic reduction in tillage intensity, resulting in significant cost savings as well as potential gains in wheat yield through earlier planting of wheat. Wheat farmers who adopted zero tillage could enhance their farm income by about US$100 per hectare. The cost-saving effect alone makes zero tillage profitable and is the main driver behind its spread. The potential environmental benefits of zero tillage have yet to be fully realized and imply tackling the challenge of reducing tillage for the rice crop that follows wheat, retaining crop residues as mulch, and diversification of crops. Equity also poses a challenge: there is a need to extend the gains more rigorously to the less endowed areas and farmers. Zero tillage’s impact has been achieved through an intervention that has proven privately attractive; an enabling process that combined elements of persistence, flexibility, inclusiveness, and facilitation; and a context that implied the need for change. To replicate and extend this success, viable and dynamic innovation systems should be developed that can deliver and adapt interventions such as zero tillage. Addressing the existing knowledge gaps regarding zero tillage’s socioeconomic, livelihood, and environmental impacts would enhance the ability to outscale in

N2  - The concept of microcredit was first introduced in Bangladesh by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. Professor Yunus started Grameen Bank (GB) more than 30 years ago with the aim of reducing poverty by providing small loans to the country’s rural poor (Yunus 1999). Microcredit has evolved over the years and does not only provide credit to the poor, but also now spans a myriad of other services including savings, insurance, remittances and non-financial services such as financial literacy training and skills development programmes; microcredit is now referred to as microfinance (Armendáriz de Aghion and Morduch 2005, 2010). A key feature of microfinance has been the targeting of women on the grounds that, compared to men, they perform better as clients of microfinance institutions and that their participation has more desirable development outcomes (Pitt and Khandker 1998). Despite the apparent success and popularity of microfinance, no clear evidence yet exists that microfinance programmes have positive impacts (Armendáriz de Aghion and Morduch 2005, 2010; and many others). There have been four major reviews examining impacts of microfinance (Sebstad and Chen, 1996; Gaile and Foster 1996, Goldberg 2005, Odell 2010, see also Orso 2011). These reviews concluded that, while anecdotes and other inspiring stories (such as Todd 1996) purported to show that microfinance can make a real difference in the lives of those served, rigorous quantitative evidence on the nature, magnitude and balance of microfinance impact is still scarce and inconclusive (Armendáriz de Aghion and Morduch 2005, 2010). Overall, it is widely acknowledged that no well-known study robustly shows any strong impacts of microfinance (Armendáriz de Aghion and Morduch 2005, p199-230). Because of the growth of the microfinance industry and the attention the sector has received from policy makers, donors and private investors in recent years, existing microfinance impact evaluations need to be re-investigated; the robustness of claims that microfinance successfully alleviates poverty and empowers women must be scrutinised more carefully. Hence, this review re- visits the evidence of microfinance evaluations focusing on the technical challenges of conducting rigorous microfinance impact evaluations.

N2  - The hybrid rice technology is one of the many ways in which productivity of scarce resources devoted to rice production could be enhanced, with the consequent alleviation of food insecurity. The findings of this study show that the hybrid rice technology has so far made some sizable contributions to per-capita availability of rice in adopting countries with marginal spillover effects to other regions. However, at forecasted population growths, a massive intensification of adoption would be needed to maintain per-capita availability of rice at baseline levels. But even with adoption rates climbing significantly, much higher equilibrium prices are expected, which will represent a challenge for the hungry in many parts of the world. While hybrid rice has the potential to contribute significantly to improve production and food security, more efforts are needed

N2  - This case study explores the half century of successful efforts of the international wheat stem and leaf rust resistance programs within the context of the international agricultural research system. The study uses a historical perspective to examine the major factors that underpin the success, and presents the impacts on economic returns, food security, and poverty in developing countries. It concludes that the major reasons for success in research on durable stem and leaf rust resistance rested on the following: symbiotic relationships of the collaborative international and national programs; free exchange of genetic resources and information; human resource development; and long-term donor commitment. Data presented show that the use of durable rust resistance has significant economic returns as well as positive impacts on poverty reduction, nutrition, food security, and the environment. Nevertheless, in recent years, decreased donor support for agriculture and productivity has had negative effects. The recent occurrence of a new strain of stem rust that defeated key durable resistance genes has endangered large wheat areas in developing countries. This highlights the critical need for continuous research and vigilance to keep ahead of the ever changing pathogenic microbes

N2  - As in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of poor smallholders in Malawi are left out of the agricultural extension and credit systems. These households, characterized by landholdings of less than 1 hectare and very low crop yields, are unable to grow enough food to feed themselves even though they focus much effort on producing food crops, especially maize. It has been argued that most of these farmers are too poor and cash-strapped to be able to benefit from any kind of access to credit and that, even if they received adequate supplies of the right inputs, their land constraints are so severe that any increase in productivity would still fall short of guaranteeing their food security. For these households, credit to support nonfarm income-generating activities has been suggested as a policy alternative for alleviating their food insecurity. To gain a better understanding of the possible role of credit in improving household food security and alleviating poverty in Malawi, in November 1994 the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Department of Rural Development, Bunda College of Agriculture, University of Malawi, initiated a research program on rural financial markets and household food security in Malawi. The main objective of the research program was to analyze the determinants of access to credit in Malawi and its impact on farm and nonfarm income and on household food security. The study also sought to quantify the relationship between the demand for formal loans and that for informal loans. From a policy perspective, such an analysis is important for at least two reasons. First, by quantifying the welfare impact of access to financial services, it can inform policymakers about the social benefits (if any) of policy strategies to promote the formation and expansion of microfinance institutions in rural areas. Second, the analysis can provide knowledge about the relative importance of the various socioeconomic factors within or beyond the control of policy that determine whether or not some households will benefit from access to formal credit. This latter information can guide the design of institutional arrangements and the choice of financial services to be offered to different target groups. The research emanating from this program was published during 199698 in a number of reports and papers disseminated by IFPRI and the Bunda College of Agriculture, following an October 1996 workshop held at the college at which the major x research results were shared and discussed with policymakers, microfinance practitioners, and researchers. This research report presents an in-depth analysis addressing the research objectives described. The study analyzed the determinants of access to formal and informal credit and the demand for loans. It found that formal lenders in Malawisuch as rural banks, savings and credit cooperatives, and special credit programs supported by the government and nongovernmental organizationsprefer to give loans to households with diversified asset portfolios and therefore more diversified incomes. This is presumably done to increase and stabilize repayment rates. It also found that households in Malawi are generally credit constrained in both the formal and informal sectors of the credit market. For example, close to half of the households participating in formal credit programs still have binding credit constraints. However, Malawian households would borrow on average only about half the amount of any increase in their credit limits. The level of interest rates charged on loans seems not to be an important factor for households in deciding in which microfinance institution to participate. Nonprice attributes of credit institutions and their services play a larger role. These attributes include the types of loans provided and the restrictions on their use, as well as the types of nonfinancial services provided by the programs, such as training in the management of microenterprises. This result suggests that the acceptance of an institution by its clientele, and therefore its prospects for growth and sustainability, are determined by a range of characteristics of both its financial and its nonfinancial services. The main findings of the study regarding the impact of access to credit on household welfare outcomes do not support the notion that improving access to microcredit is always a potent means for alleviating povertyan opinion voiced, for example, at the Microcredit Summit in Washington, D.C., in February 1997. Both the tabular and the econometric analysis shows that when households choose to borrow they realize lower net crop incomes than nonborrowers. Although this result is not statistically significant, it nonetheless points out the risk of borrowing: that borrowers can be worse off after repaying the principal and interest. Two main reasons for the negative (albeit insignificant) relationship between borrowing and net crop incomes are identified. Both have important implications for financial sector policy and the conduct of rural financial institutions in Malawi. The first reason is the focus of the loan portfolio on one loan product, which provides farmers too much costly fertilizer for hybrid maize. Three of the four institutions investigated in this study provided agricultural credit, focusing mainly on an input package for hybrid maize. The second reason is the below-average rainfall in the two survey years and the concentration of the loan portfolios of the formal lenders on maize, a drought-sensitive crop. Consistent with the insignificant results for crop income, we find no significant impact of access to credit on the per capita incomes, food security, and nutritional status of credit program members. As the credit services of the formal institutions are mostly geared toward income generation, and in particular toward the growing xi of fertilized hybrid maize and tobacco, access to the type of credit products offered in Malawi is expected to have mostly indirect effects on consumption and nutrition through its potential effect on income. The rural financial institutions in Malawi covered in this study do not offer financial products, such as consumption credit and precautionary savings options, that could eventually have a direct effect on consumption or on nutritional status. Growing tobacco is found to be the most important determinant of household crop income. Another finding of the study, however, is the fact that households that grow tobacco are less food secure, with significantly lower per capita daily calorie intake and a higher prevalence of both chronic and acute malnutrition compared with households that do not. The food insecurity and malnutrition of tobacco households may be traced to the combination of larger than average household sizes because of the labor-intensive nature of tobacco growing and the high relative cost of buying maize for consumption. The study also found that the price of maize has a significant and negative direct impact on household per capita calorie intake, while its indirect effect on the latter through household income is positive but statistically insignificant. This finding is consistent with two other findings of the study: that the marginal impact of the price of maize on household income, although sizable, is not statistically different from zero and that smallholder farmers in Malawi are, on average, net buyers of maize because of their 59 percent average maize self-sufficiency. Therefore any increase in the price of maize is likely to have a negative impact on the food security of the average smallholder farm household. A major conclusion of this study is that the contribution of rural microfinance institutions to the income of smallholders can be limited or outright negative if the design of the institutions and their services does not take into account the constraints on and demands of their clients. Developing attractive credit services requires both identifying farm and nonfarm enterprises and technologies that are profitable under the conditions experienced by subsistence-oriented farmers and responding to the numerous constraints of resource-poor rural households. The results suggest that a strategy of expanding financial institutions in rural, drought-prone areas with inadequate market and other infrastructure mayat least in below-average rainfall yearshave no significant positive welfare effects. The risk of drought in Malawi, as in much of rainfed Sub-Saharan Africa and other countries, constitutes a considerable challenge for developing sustainable rural financial institutions. In such environments, a strategy providing for greater diversification of the portfolio of assets and liabilities of the rural financial institutions, as well as adequate provisions for loan defaults and the building up of reserves for rescheduling loans, is a necessary precondition for rural financial institutions to prosper and to be able to offer their clientele reliable access to future credit and savings services. The necessary resources, infrastructure, and socioeconomic environment are not yet in place for access to formal credit to realize its full potential benefits for Malawis rural population. Thereforeconsidering that the formation of sustainable rural financial institutions is a difficult task to achieve in rural economies that lack xii irrigation, exhibit insufficient hard and soft infrastructure, and support a poorly educated rural population adversely affected by malnutrition and disease, and considering that the benefits at the household level may not materialize in drought years the report recommends a cautious and gradual strategy for expansion of rural financial institutions in Malawi. This strategy would require direct support by the state through an adequate legal and regulatory framework, through the support of institutional innovations and pilot programs in rural areas that may ha

N2  - Flooding is a normal part of the ecology of Bangladesh. The 1998 flood was especially serious because of its depth and duration. At its peak, the flood covered two-thirds of the country, causing severe damage to the rice crop and threatening the food security of millions of households. Total rice production losses exceeded 2 million tons—about 10 percent of annual consumption. In sharp contrast to earlier flood disasters, particularly that of 1974, no major food crisis occurred. Instead, large-scale, private-sector imports, made possible by trade liberalization in the early 1990s, stabilized rice markets. Government food transfers to poor households also limited the impact of the flood on household access to food. This paper sheds light on the contribution of price stabilization to household food security following a major natural shock through estimates of the impact of rice prices and other factors on calorie consumption in 1998 and 1999. More broadly, the paper examines the components of the public and private response that prevented a major food crisis

N2  - This paper examines whether and to what extent amendments in inheritance legislation impact women's physical and human capital investments, using disaggregated household level data from India. The authors use inheritance patterns over three generations of individuals to assess the impact of changes in the Hindu Succession Act that grant daughters equal coparcenary birth rights in joint family property that were denied to daughters in the past. The causal effect is isolated by exploiting the variation in the timing of father's death to compare within household bequests of land given to sons and daughters in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The analysis shows that the amendment significantly increased daughters' likelihood to inherit land, but that even after the amendment substantial bias persists. The results also indicate a robust increase in educational attainment of daughters, suggesting an alternative channel of wealth transfer.

N2  - Without reliable information on large-scale investment, it is difficult to determine which of these positions is right or to advise countries on how to minimize the risks associated with such investments while capitalizing on any opportunities. This information is often not available to those affected, key decision makers, or the public. This report aims to overcome this information gap and provide key data needed to facilitate an informed debate about large-scale land acquisition. Its main focus is analytical rather than normative, and its purpose fourfold: Use empirical evidence to inform governments in client countries, especially those with large amounts of land, as well as investors, development partners, and civil society, about what is happening on the ground. Put these events into context and assess their likely long-term impact by identifying global drivers of land supply and demand and highlight how country policies affect land use, household welfare, and distributional outcomes at the local level. Complement the focus on demand for land with a geographically referenced assessment of the supply side, i.e. the availability of potentially suitable agricultural land. Outline options for different actors to minimize risks and capitalize on opportunities to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth, especially in rural areas. The World Bank recognizes that large scale agricultural investment poses significant challenges which can be addressed successfully only if stakeholders collaborate effectively. Together with FAO, IFAD, UNCTAD and other partners it has formulated seven principles that all involved should adhere to for investments to do no harm, be sustainable, and contribute to development. These principles are summarized in Box 1. ix

N2  - Promotion of hybrid rice has been the central goal of the government's rice production program since 2001. Yet, farmers' adoption rate has remained low despite concerted efforts and massive subsidies. The highly subsidized approach of the program has been not just ineffective but costly in terms of wasting scarce budgetary resources, compromising the government's regulatory functions, promoting corruption, and distorting farmers' choice of varieties. The government should remove the present system of subsidies on hybrid seeds and related agricultural inputs which are all private goods in nature.

N2  - This study - commissioned by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) – evaluates the direct effects (i.e. the direct and induced outputs) of budget support in Zambia. It forms part of a joint international evaluation of budget support in Zambia. The report focuses on strategies of the cooperating partners in providing budget support, the processes and structure of donor harmonization and alignment with government policies and systems, and the effects of budget support on induced outputs such as institutional performance, public financial management, and allocative and operational efficiency. The overall assessment of budget support in Zambia is positive: The evaluation concludes that budget support has helped to realize a number of objectives in Zambia, especially as a financing instrument supporting the national development strategy. At the same time, the evaluation also concludes that budget support could have been even more effective in Zambia, in particular as an instrument to promote good governance and effective state institutions. Weaknesses on the part of Zambian government as well as a lack of harmonization and coordination on the donor side have weakened the potential of the instrument in this respect.

N2  - This paper investigates the impacts of cotton marketing reforms on farm productivity, a key element for poverty alleviation, in rural Zambia. The reforms comprised the eliminaon of the Zambian cotton marketing board that was in place since 1977. Following liberalization, the sector adopted an outgrower scheme, whereby firms provided extension tiservices to farmers and sold inputs on loans that were repaid at the time of harvest. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower scheme, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme. Our findings indicate that the reforms led to interesting dynamics in cotton farming. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and productivity in cotton declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme of later years, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm productivity significantly increased.

N2  - This paper uses new data on agricultural policy interventions to examine the political economy of agricultural trade policies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, African governments have discriminated against agricultural producers in general (relative to producers in non-agricultural sectors), and against producers of export agriculture in particular. While more moderate in recent years, these patterns of discrimination persist. They do so even though farmers comprise a political majority. Rather than claiming the existence of a single best approach to the analysis of policy choice, we explore the impact of three factors: institutions, regional inequality, and tax revenuegeneration. We find that agricultural taxation increases with the rural population share in the absence of electoral party competition; yet, the existence of party competition turns the lobbying disadvantage of the rural majority into political advantage. We also find that privileged cash crop regions are particular targets for redistributive taxation, unless the country's president comes from that region. In addition, governments of resource-rich countries, while continuing to tax export producers, reduce their taxation of food consumers.
