TI  - Assessing the impact of the Green Revolution, 1960 to 2000
PY  - 2003
AB  - We summarize the findings of a recently completed study of the productivity impacts of international crop genetic improvement research in developing countries. Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of “modern varieties” for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions.

TI  - Measuring economic water scarcity in agriculture: a cross-country empirical investigation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract High water availability enhances agricultural performance and food security. However, many countries where water is abundant according to hydrological indicators face difficulties in the utilization of water in agriculture, being in a situation of economic water scarcity (EWS), due to lack of institutional and material means for water management and governance. EWS faces a stronger challenge of measurability, if compared to physical water scarcity. Since the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator on Integrated management of domestic and transboundary water resources (IWRM) is a unique attempt to quantify information on water management at a national level, we explore whether it can represent a valid metric for EWS measurement. We first show that a high level of water management is neither necessarily associated to high economic power of the country nor to low physical water availability. Then, we analyze whether the indicator can predict typical EWS situations such as low agricultural productivity and inefficient water use. Although the importance of water institutions for agriculture is well known through case studies at the local level, we make the first attempt to quantify the strengths of this relation at a global scale for different crops in climatic diverse countries. We detect a positive and significant association between IWRM level and yield, and consequently a negative and equally significant association between the IWRM level and the crop water footprint. Statistical significance holds also when potentially confounding variables are included in a multiple regression analysis. We infer from this analysis that good water management, as detectable through the IWRM indicator, improves land productivity and water saving, in turn mitigating EWS. Our findings pave the way toward the use of the IWRM indicator as a valuable tool for measuring EWS in agriculture, bridging the measurability gap of economic water scarcity, with straightforward policy implications in favour of investments in water management as a lever for enhancing food security and development.

TI  - Perspective: Positive experiences from Africa in water, sanitation and hygiene
PY  - 2004
AB  - Nowhere in the world is poverty more visible, more destructive and more pervasive than in Africa. Too often, Africa is associated with stories of failure and pessimism, of wars and famines, floods and unrest. Africa appears to be slipping back on many development indicators, even as other parts of the world move ahead. In 2003, however, there are prospects of achieving progress in water, sanitation and hygiene in Africa. Across the continent, there is a strong sense of the need for peace, democracy and co-operation. Through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative, industrialised countries are finally proposing to write off a significant part of the debt into which the poorest countries have fallen. Many African countries have written Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, which give clarity and direction to the development work in those countries. Within the water sector itself, the African Ministerial Conference on Water (AMCOW) has been formed to share ideas and lessons and to provide mutual support and active direction. Recent meetings, especially the World Summit on Sustainable Development (August 2002), are giving fresh political impetus to this work. This paper suggests five priorities for achieving the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goals in Africa. It relates them to practical examples of inspiring and positive initiatives in water and sanitation from across the continent. These examples have worked, or have the potential to work, at a large scale, are demonstrably sustainable, and do not benefit from too many unique local conditions. These characteristics enable the lessons from these examples to be useful for other people in, and indeed outside, Africa.

TI  - Key and Smart Actions to Alleviate Hunger and Poverty Through Irrigation and Drainage
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the pursuit of information to support the policies and actions to alleviate hunger and poverty from a perspective of the role and impacts of irrigation and drainage, this paper attempts to provide correlation between water scarcity, community and poverty. Many reviews have found strong direct and indirect relationships between irrigation and poverty. One of the main goals of the international community is to eliminate hunger and poverty and in this perspective, through the Millennium Development Goals much progress has been achieved and evidence obtained. Sustainable Development Goals and various United Nations and other initiatives, intend to move forward this agenda by making it a part of the broader development frameworks. In this paper, the important elements of the irrigation and drainage that affect the alleviation of hunger and poverty have been discussed. These elements are grouped into governance, rights-based developments, water rights and pricing, management, efficiency improvement, and role of technology. Both the potential and the need to make use of innovative technology and solutions in irrigation are underlined and these can be used to cater the challenges in different sub-sectors. The main focus of these solutions are on maximizing productivity and efficiency, reducing water losses, achieving sustainable intensification and managing demands on water resources and the associated trade-offs.

TI  - Global analysis of river systems: from Earth system controls to Anthropocene syndromes
PY  - 2003
AB  - Continental aquatic systems from rivers to the coastal zone are considered within two perspectives: (i) as a major link between the atmosphere, pedosphere, biosphere and oceans within the Earth system with its Holocene dynamics, and (ii) as water and aquatic biota resources progressively used and transformed by humans. Human pressures have now reached a state where the continental aquatic systems can no longer be considered as being controlled by only Earth system processes, thus defining a new era, the Anthropocene. Riverine changes, now observed at the global scale, are described through a first set of syndromes (flood regulation, fragmentation, sediment imbalance, neo-arheism, salinization, chemical contamination, acidification, eutrophication and microbial contamination) with their related causes and symptoms. These syndromes have direct influences on water uses, either positive or negative. They also modify some Earth system key functions such as sediment, water, nutrient and carbon balances, greenhouse gas emissions and aquatic biodiversity. Evolution of river syndromes over the past 2000 years is complex: it depends upon the stages of regional human development and on natural conditions, as illustrated here for the chemical contamination syndrome. River damming, eutrophication and generalized decrease of river flow due to irrigation are some of the other global features of river changes. Future management of river systems should also consider these long-term impacts on the Earth system.

TI  - The role of conservation agriculture in sustainable agriculture.
PY  - 2007
AB  - The paper focuses on conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till, NT) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, as a more sustainable cultivation system for the future. Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice-wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize-wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been used in these two environments to raise production sustainably and profitably. Benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global warming are also discussed. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to sustainably produce more food from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this goal.

TI  - Participatory Irrigation Management: Barind Model a New Sustainable Initiative
PY  - 2019
AB  - During the past 20 years, substantial efforts were made to improve irrigation Management-Operation & Maintenance (MOM) through introduction of participatory irrigation management (PIM). PIM proved generally successful on small and medium schemes but it has yielded limited results on large schemes. Stakeholder engagement in irrigation system shapes hydrosocial territories: (1) by reducing tension between stakeholders, (2) by redirecting regional planning and strategy, (3) by highlighting water crises, (4) by decentralizing water responsibilities and (5) by integrating values and beliefs from different stakeholders (Sandra Ricart, et.al, 2018). Privatization started to become politically fashionable in the late 1980. In this context privatization means off-loading government ownership or responsibility for operation into the private sector, either to the farmers themselves or to an intermediate private subcontractor. But is it just a means of off-loading responsibility from a government line management system that can't cope, or is it really to benefit the farmers? (Adrian Laycock, 2011). Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) is an autonomous authority. The BMDA does not require external finance and sustainable finance to operate the irrigation project. There are around 16,000 deep tube wells and surface lift pumps covering around 0.6 million hectares (round the year) under BMDA management. BMDA is managed by a board chaired by an appointee of the government. There are three other members representatives from farmers including other relevant department's representatives. BMDA has introduced innovative concept for prepayment for water; this was started using a system of using electronic prepaid meters. There are no formal WUOs established instead keeps a very close liaison with the farmers and the communities through their field offices, this approach appears to be effective. The chief executive of a successful irrigation project should have a clear idea about people, land and water.

TI  - Equity and productivity assessments in the Olifants River basin, South Africa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Emerging approaches to water resources development and management typically highlight equity and productivity as two main objectives. In the context of integrated water resources management within a river basin, managers and stakeholders often need a comparative assessment of different options for water augmentation and/or allocation. Pitting such options against predefined objectives, such as equity and productivity, requires an assessment of the effects that available options will have on these objectives. Available documentation indicates that not only does the interpretation of such objectives vary widely, but also the available methods for assessing equity and productivity run into significant limitations in the availability of adequate data. This limitation has largely kept decision makers from gaining a comprehensive overview of equity and productivity scenarios, whether within or across sectors, that could facilitate better-informed decisions. To address this methodological gap, this article scrutinizes different notions associated with equity and water productivity, and limitations in prevalent assessment methods with the view to develop and demonstrate pragmatic methodologies for assessing equity and productivity in data-scarce contexts. The discussion and findings are based on a review of relevant literature and empirical and consultative research work in the Olifants River basin in South Africa. The demonstrated methodologies for assessing equity and productivity, besides being useful in data-scarce contexts, are insightful for initiating several policy measures and also for exploring the relationship between equity and water productivity.

PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper is based on a review of experiences with a wide range of micro-agricultural water management technologies in sub-Saharan Africa with a special emphasis on southern Africa. The major finding of the study is that these technologies have the potential to make major contributions to improving food security, reducing rural poverty and promoting broad-based agricultural growth. However, there are serious policy impediments to successfully scaling out the use of these technologies at both national and regional levels. The paper makes seven specific policy recommendations whose implementation would enable promotion of wider uptake.

TI  - Agricultural intensification, irrigation and the environment in South Asia: Issues and policy options
PY  - 2008
AB  - High population pressure and the rapid pace of human activity including urbanization, industrialization and other economic activities have led to a dwindling supply of arable land per capita and a process of agricultural intensification in South Asia. While this process has significantly increased food production to feed the growing population, it has also entailed considerable damage to the physical environment, including degradation and depletion of natural resources and unsustainable use of land and water resources. This paper employs the analytical tools of economic theory, environmental and ecological economics to model the impact of irrigation in South Asia. It underscores the need for an eclectic approach to policy responses stemming from private and common property rights theories, externality theory and sustainability theory with a view to environmentalizing agricultural development.

TI  - Soil and Water Conservation Techniques for Sustainable Agriculture
PY  - 2019
AB  - Natural resources of the country are humiliating due to biotic and abiotic pressures. Around 146.8 Mha land was estimated under degraded land of India by National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSSL it results in depletion of reservoirs storage capacity by 1–2%. Intensive agricultural practices accelerate the rate of soil erosion. In this context, use of groundwater (by drilling tube wells) in high rates also depletes the groundwater level. The groundwater level of 65% open wells was depleted. Such conditions negatively impact on productivity of agriculture crops. High rate of runoff degrades soil health and ultimately decreases the food production of the country. Vegetation and mechanical measures need to be applied separately or in combination for solving such problems of natural resource (soil and water) degradation. Along with such measures, some improved techniques may need to be designed for judicious management of natural resources. Although there were many schemes/programmes/missions also running through government and non-governmental organization to combat these problems, we have to work for the policy on conservation of natural resources through sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Water distribution systems and on-farm irrigation practices: limitations and consequences for Afghanistan’s agricultural productivity
PY  - 2014
AB  - The absence of a reliable water supply to farmers is the single most important impediment to food security and agricultural expansion in Afghanistan. Agricultural water supply and distribution systems are reviewed, and a pragmatic strategy is outlined to increase water capital and to better utilize available water. The development and dissemination of on-farm practices that improve water management through community-based approaches represent the best opportunity for improving farmer livelihoods, maintaining social stability and developing a sound agriculture-based economy in the immediate future, independent of the success or failure of national water policies.

TI  - A review of types of risks in agriculture: What we know and what we need to know
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study examines the scope and depth of research on the five major types of risks in agriculture, and the extent to which those studies have addressed the impacts of, and policies to mitigate individual types of risk as opposed to more holistic analyses of the multiple sources of risk with which farmers have to cope with. Risk is at the center of new paradigms and approaches that inform risk management initiatives and shape investments in many countries. Although the literature includes several substantive reviews of the methods available for risk analysis and their empirical applications have been extensively scrutinized, limited information exists about which types of risks have received sufficient attention, and which have not. This limited information is perplexing because farmers manage multiple risks at the same time and unanticipated events continue to have substantial impacts on farmers. We identify 3283 peer-reviewed studies that address one or more of the five major types of risk in agriculture (production risk, market risk, institutional risk, personal risk, and financial risk) published between 1974 and 2019. We conduct a literature search and then apply an eligibility criteria to retain eligible studies from the search. We then classify those eligible studies based on risk type and geographic focus. We placed no limit on the temporal scale, geographic focus, or study method for inclusion in our search. Results show that 66% of the 3283 studies focused solely on production risk, with only 15% considering more than one type of risk. Only 18 studies considered all five types of risk and those either asked how farmers perceived the importance of each risk or were focused on conceptual issues, rather than assessing how exposure to all the risks quantitatively affects farm indicators such as yields or incomes. Without more detailed analyses of the multiple types of risks faced by farmers, farmers and policymakers will lack the information needed to devise relevant risk management strategies and policies. A shift in research focus towards the analysis of multiple contemporaneous types of risk may provide a basis that gives farmers greater options for coping with and managing risk. We discuss some of the challenges for studying multiple risks simultaneously, including data requirements and the need for probability distributions and the role of simulation approaches.

TI  - Smallholder groundwater irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa: country-level estimates of development potential
PY  - 2013
AB  - The abundance of groundwater resources of Sub-Saharan Africa is generally well recognized, but quantitative estimates of their potential for irrigation development are lacking. This study derives estimates using a simple and generic water balance approach and data from secondary sources for 13 countries. Even with conservative assumptions and accounting for water demands from other sectors, including the environment, a 120-fold increase (by 13.5 million hectares) in the area under groundwater irrigation is possible for the countries considered. This expansion could improve the livelihoods of approximately 40% of the present-day rural population.

TI  - Promoting Agricultural Research and Development to Strengthen Food Security in South Asia
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study aims to highlight the status of agricultural R&D in South Asia and contends that creating an effective agricultural research and innovation systems is a vital element to ensure food security in this region. South Asia is home to around one-fourth of mankind and houses the largest proportion of undernourished people in the world. Despite a period of marked economic growth averaging 6% a year over the past two decades, it remains the world's second poorest region contributing a mere 2.2% in global annual GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of South Asian economy employing around 60% of the total workforce and generating around 20% of total GDP. South Asia has the recognition of being the second most food-insecure region next only to sub-Saharan Africa. Though there is growing evidence that technological innovation has a key role to play in increasing agricultural production and strengthening food security, agricultural research and development (R&D) sector has failed to garner sufficient attention till now. This study also depicts the current situation of food security in South Asia and illustrates how agricultural education and innovation hold the master key to solve the food security issues for the world's most densely populated region.

TI  - Irrigation and poverty alleviation: review of the empirical evidence
PY  - 2004
AB  - L'objectif de cette etude est de clarifier les relations entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete en offrant une revue objective de la recherche recente sur le sujet. Les questions cles abordees ici sont: (1) quel est le role du developpement et de la gestion de l'irrigation sur la reduction de la pauvrete? (2) quels sont les articulations et chemins par lesquels l'irrigation contribue a reduire la pauvrete? (3) quelle est l'ampleur des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? et (4) quels sont les facteurs cles des impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation? Notre revue se focalise sur des etudes empiriques d'actualite en Asie. La revue approfondie entreprise suggere qu'il y a de fortes connections entre l'irrigation et la pauvrete. Ces connections sont a la fois directes et indirectes. Les connections directes agissent a travers des effets localises et a l'echelle des foyers, tandis que les connections indirectes operent a travers des impacts collectifs ou a l'echelle sub-nationale et nationale. L'irrigation beneficie aux pauvres par le biais d'une production accrue, de rendements plus eleves, d'un plus faible risque d'echec cultural et d'une meilleure situation de l'emploi tout au long de l'annee, dans les exploitations comme en dehors. L'irrigation permet aux petits producteurs d'adopter des cultures plus diversifiees et de passer d'une production de subsistance, de faible valeur, a une production de forte valeur, orientee vers le marche. L'augmentation de la production donne acces aux pauvres a une nourriture abordable. Les connections indirectes operent a travers des effets a l'echelle regionale, nationale et de l'economie. Les investissements en irrigation agissent comme des modificateurs de production et d'approvisionnement, et ont d'importants effets positifs sur la croissance, beneficiant aux pauvres sur le long terme. Au-dela de ceci, les benefices de l'irrigation reviennent aussi aux pauvres et sans-terres sur le long terme, malgre le fait que, sur un plus court terme, les benefices vers ceux qui n'ont pas ou peu de terres peuvent etre faibles du fait que l'allocation de l'eau tend a etre basee sur les terres. En depit de cela, les pauvres et sans-terres beneficient, a la fois en termes absolus et relatifs, des investissements en irrigation. De recentes avancees dans les technologies d'irrigation, par exemple les systemes de micro-irrigation, ont un fort potentiel anti-pauvrete. Des etudes en cours dans des pays asiatiques supportent fortement le fait que l'irrigation aide a reduire a la fois la pauvrete permanente et temporaire. Au-dela de ceci, l'irrigation aide a alleger la pauvrete dans ses pires formes, nommement la pauvrete chronique. En general, l'irrigation augmente la productivite, favorise la croissance et reduit la pauvrete. Des exemples d'effets d'externalites negatives associes a des systemes irrigues de grande et moyenne echelle pointent vers des problemes de gestion, appelant par consequent a des mecanismes de reponse plus englobants de la part des communautes politiques et de gestion. Les impacts anti-pauvrete de l'irrigation peuvent etre intensifies en creant les conditions ou les environnements qui permettraient de realiser une inclusion fonctionnelle des pauvres. Ces conditions et environnements comprennent: (1) un acces equitable a la terre; (2) une gestion integree des ressources en eau; (3) un acces a de l'eau de surface et souterraine de bonne qualite et en quantite adequate; (4) une technologie moderne de production; (5) un passage a une production a forte valeur ajoutee, orientee vers le marche; et (6) des opportunites pour la vente des produits agricoles a faibles couts transactionnels. Les benefices de l'irrigation aux pauvres peuvent etre intensifies en initiant

TI  - Soil–water conservation and rainwater harvesting strategies in the semi-arid Mzingwane Catchment, Limpopo Basin, Zimbabwe
PY  - 2006
AB  - Various soil water management practices have been developed and promoted for the semi arid areas of Zimbabwe. These include a variety of infield crop management practices that range from primary and seconday tillage approaches for crop establishment and weed management through to land forming practices such as tied ridges and land fallowing. Tillage methods evaluated in this study include deep winter ploughing, no till tied ridges, modified tied ridges, clean and mulch ripping, and planting basins. Data collected from the various trials since the 1990s show that mulch ripping and other minimum tillage practices consistently increased soil water content and crop yields compared to traditional spring ploughing. Trial results also showed higher soil loss from conventionally ploughed plots compared to plots under different minimum tillage practices.

TI  - Drip irrigation for small farmers. A new initiative to alleviate hunger and poverty
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Despite the impressive gains in global food production over the last half century, an estimated 790 million people remain hungry. Many of the chronically hungry are poor farm families, who have neither the means to produce the food they need nor sufficient income to purchase it. For them, access to irrigation water, or the means to use the water they have more productively, is a key to increasing their crop production, their incomes, and their household food security. Ironically, a technology typically associated with wealthy farmers, drip irrigation, may hold the key to alleviating a significant share of rural hunger and poverty. A new spectrum of drip systems keyed to different income levels and farm sizes (beginning with a US$5 bucket kit for home gardens) now exists and can from the backbone of a second green revolution, this one aimed specifically at poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We describe the experience with affordable drip irrigation to date, including its ...

TI  - Quantitative maps of groundwater resources in Africa
PY  - 2012
AB  - In Africa, groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is forecast to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources in Africa, and groundwater storage is consequently omitted from assessments of freshwater availability. Here we present the first quantitative continent-wide maps of aquifer storage and potential borehole yields in Africa based on an extensive review of available maps, publications and data. We estimate total groundwater storage in Africa to be 0.66 million km 3 (0.36‐1.75 million km 3 ). Not all of this groundwater storage is available for abstraction, but the estimated volume is more than 100 times estimates of annual renewable freshwater resources on Africa. Groundwater resources are unevenly distributed: the largest groundwater volumes are found in the large sedimentary aquifers in the North African countries Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Sudan. Nevertheless, for many African countries appropriately sited and constructed boreholes can support handpump

TI  - Water diplomacy and nexus governance in a transboundary context: In the search for complementarities.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Growing evidence within nexus research has highlighted the importance for sustainable governance of considering the interdependencies between water, energy, food and the environment, whereas water diplomacy has provided the necessary tools to address water conflicts of a transboundary nature. This paper therefore identifies and evaluates unrealised complementarities between nexus governance and water diplomacy, and discusses the benefits of integrating both for improved transboundary basin management. Two case studies - a wastewater treatment plant within the Jordan's nexus vision and a research project into management of the transboundary Zambezi River Basin - illustrate the identified complementarities and their contribution towards collaborative transboundary natural resources management. On one hand, the consideration of synergies and trade-offs between water, energy and food systems and beyond the river basin scale within nexus governance engages a larger diversity of stakeholders and can help realise more balanced agreements between sectors and hence complement water diplomacy goals. The enriched negotiations arising from a nexus approach can facilitate benefits-sharing in water diplomacy due to the broader exchange of experiences across several natural resources systems. Likewise, international nexus development projects involving a diverse range of sectors and stakeholders can ultimately facilitate peace building through inter-state cooperation and reduce the focus on disputed natural resources. On the other hand, water diplomacy provides tools to address complexity and capture political contexts that overcome the traditional technical and 'most-rational-solution' methods. With the application of joint fact finding, value creation and collaborative adaptive management, the added value includes the generation of a shared understanding that embeds politics in decision-making and promotes mutual gains. Further collaboration and on-the-ground experiences between researchers, policy makers and the private sector are needed, to acknowledge and act upon the complementarities of nexus governance and water diplomacy, with the final outcome of promoting cooperation in the management of transboundary resources.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Key Messages: (1) Human activities and processes of all types -- demographic, economic and social -- can exert pressures on water resources and need to be managed. (2) These pressures are in turn affected by a range of factors such as technological innovation, institutional and financial conditions and climate change. (3) The rapid global rise in living standards combined with population growth presents the major threat to the sustainability of water resources and environmental services.

TI  - Stakeholder collaboration and irrigation practices in Ghana: issues, challenges, and the way forward
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the era of climate change, irrigation is playing a pivotal role in stabilising food production, enabling dry season farming, and improving farmers’ livelihoods, particularly in Asia and African countries. Recently, Ghana has taken steps to respond to the concept of stakeholder collaboration to improve the irrigated agricultural sub-sector as well as enhance farmers’ resilience to changing climate. However, there is limited attention to recent diverging experiences on collaborative practices from irrigation stakeholders. Using the Weija Irrigation Scheme as a case study, this study explores stakeholders’ perceptions of collaborative practices in irrigation management by identifying gaps and providing suggestions to enhance stakeholder collaboration. We conducted focus group discussions with farmers and in-depth interviews with key informants, such as heads of farmer groups, government departments, agencies, and agricultural extension agents. Secondary data from conventional literature, organisational websites, and quarterly reports were also used. Following the integrated collaboration governance theory, effective collaboration was measured based on the tripartite prism of “principled engagement, shared motivation, and capacity for joint action”. Analysis of the data reveals that despite the central government’s resolve for collaborative irrigation planning and management, effective collaboration remains limited. Based on principle engagement, this study points out that weak communication and sharing of information remain in the planning and management of the Weija Irrigation Scheme. In terms of shared motivation, there were minimal commitment to joint project planning, exclusion of some key stakeholders from meetings, and negative attitudes towards collaboration. Finally, the capacity for joint action (e.g. lack of fund, time, staff, and equipment) is limited. The policy implications and suggestions for further research are presented in the study.

TI  - Groundwater irrigation for smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa – a synthesis of current knowledge to guide sustainable outcomes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Groundwater irrigation for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa is growing in extent and importance. This growth is primarily driven spontaneously by the farmers themselves, spurred by improved access to low-cost technologies for pumps and drilling services as well as market opportunities for produce. This paper presents a review of the current status and knowledge of the prospects and constraints for sustainable and pro-poor groundwater irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further unlocking the potential of groundwater irrigation for smallholders will require better integrated approaches, simultaneously addressing groundwater-access constraints as well as enabling factors.

TI  - Income Distribution Impacts of Irrigation Water Distribution Policy
PY  - 1984
AB  - In the majority of lesser developed countries (LDC's) there is acute inequality in income distribution in the rural sector, particularly between large and small farms on the one hand and between land owners and the landless on the other. Irrigation water distribution policy of the government is both an economic and political problem. It has both equity and efficiency implications. It has effects on both the level and distribution of income. This paper deals with the conditions under which using water redistribution as an effective governmental policy variable can reduce inequality in the distribution of income. This paper also deals with the relationship between the objectives of equity and efficiency in water distribution under different objective realities, such as dualistic versus nondualistic conditions, two-sector versus three-sector modeling, optimum versus equal water distribution, specifically to derive the conditions under which promotion of equity promotes efficiency and vice versa and the conditions under which it does not.

TI  - Nature of Transboundary Water Conflicts: Issues of Complexity and the Enabling Conditions for Negotiated Cooperation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Water access, demand, usage and management become complex due to the crossing of multiple boundaries: political, social and jurisdictional, as well as physical, ecological and biogeochemical. This paper focuses on a particular class of complex water problems: the allocation of transboundary water (TBW) among competing riparians with conflicting needs. The complexity in TBW allocation lies in the dynamic consequences of competition that arise from the interconnections and feedbacks among actors, processes and institutions operating in the knowledge and political communities. Consequently, many TBW allocation issues become contingent upon the dynamic changes that occur within the knowledge and political communities as well as the interactions and feedback occurring between these two communities. In addition to understanding and addressing the contingent contextual factors that span the knowledge and political communities, resolving complex TBW problems also needs to be guided by contextual application of two global principles – equity and sustainability – as anchors to accommodate the values and interests of the stakeholders involved in a TBW problem. This paper examines the process that led to the relatively successful resolution of conflict over allocating the waters in the Indus basin between India and Pakistan. Using the Indus water treaty as an illustrative case, the paper identifies three enabling conditions that underlie the effectiveness of negotiating a treaty and its continuous efficacy in addressing TBW problems. The paper argues that effective resolution of complex TBW problems is rooted in the nature of the negotiation process, the provisions in the negotiated agreement and the establishment of institutional means to solve emergent problems that are related to the original agreement.

TI  - Water for Agriculture: Maintaining Food Security under Growing Scarcity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the main source of water withdrawals, accounting for around 70% of all the world’s freshwater withdrawals. The development of irrigated agriculture has boosted agricultural yields and contributed to price stability, making it possible to feed the world’s growing population. Rapidly increasing nonagricultural demands for water, changing food preferences, global climate change, and new demands for biofuel production place increasing pressure on scarce water resources. Challenges of growing water scarcity for agriculture are heightened by the increasing costs of developing new water, soil degradation, groundwater depletion, increasing water pollution, the degradation of water-related ecosystems, and wasteful use of already developed water supplies. This article discusses the role of water for agriculture and food security, the challenges facing irrigated agriculture, and the range of policies, institutions, and investments needed to secure adequate access to water for food today and in the future.

TI  - Irrigation projects in Ethiopia: what can be done to enhance effectiveness under ‘challenging contexts’?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Investment in small scale irrigation (SSI) is crucial to sustain food security and livelihoods of smallholders. In Ethiopia, the government and development partners show a growing interest in developing irrigation projects. The success of irrigation projects is determined by governance and socio-cultural contexts. Yet the lack of thorough understanding of the challenging contexts undermines the efforts to achieve sustainability outcomes in irrigation projects. This article identifies the challenging contexts to irrigation projects, examines how the challenging contexts influence the effectiveness of irrigation projects, and indicates ways of improving the effectiveness of irrigation projects under the existing challenging contexts. Data were collected between April and December 2011 in three regional states of Ethiopia using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The lack of governance capacity and accountability are critical challenges for the sustainability of the irrigation projects. In addit...

TI  - Assessment of the contribution of irrigation to poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods
PY  - 2004
AB  - Irrigation in developing countries tends to be stereotyped as equity reducing, in competition with other uses for scarce water resources, and often resulting in negative impacts for women and other disadvantaged groups. Agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction is examined. There are four inter‐related mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can reduce poverty. These are: improvements in the levels and security of productivity, employment and incomes for irrigating farm households and farm labour; the linkage and multiplier effects of agricultural intensification for the wider economy; provision of opportunities for diversification of rural livelihoods; and multiple uses of irrigation supply. There are also significant risks that badly designed and managed irrigation can negatively impact on poverty. It is concluded that irrigated farming varies widely in its form and impacts, and has diverse local attributes. Water resource management decis...

TI  - Problems of the solution: intervention into small-scale irrigation for drought proofing in the Mekele Plateau of northern Ethiopia
PY  - 2004
AB  - The Mekele Plateau, located in the semi-arid northern highland region of Ethiopia, is a drought-prone, highly degraded area. It has long been neglected by policymakers and thus recurring famine, widespread poverty, armed conflicts and mass outmigration have contributed to the near collapse of the farming systems and the livelihoods of the population. Traditional stream diversion irrigation has been practised in this area for several centuries. The systems of water management in particular may be considered inappropriate owing to the need for thriftiness in water use imposed by the local environment. The systems of headworks and canals are crude and wasteful on water. Recent interventions to improve the small-scale irrigation systems of the area have not been successful. Most interventions have preferred to introduce rainwater harvesting systems using micro-dams rather than trying to upgrade the traditional diversion schemes. Evaluation of irrigation structures in the field, interviews with key informants in government, analysis of documents and discussions with irrigators indicate that both the Ministry of Agriculture and SAERT-Commission's rainwater harvesting programmes have generally failed. The case of the most recent intervention by SAERT has failed because of myopic project planning, inadequate engineering studies, unsound designs, too short a time for implementation, and lack of full farmer involvement at different levels of project planning and implementation.

TI  - Agriculture and resource availability in a changing world: The role of irrigation
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fertile land and freshwater constitute two of the most fundamental resources for food production. These resources are affected by environmental, political, economic, and technical developments. Regional impacts may transmit to the world through increased trade. With a global forest and agricultural model, we quantify the impacts of increased demand for food due to population growth and economic development on potential land and water use until 2030. In particular, we investigate producer adaptation regarding crop and irrigation choice, agricultural market adjustments, and changes in the values of land and water. In the context of resource sustainability and food security, this study accounts for the spatial and operational heterogeneity of irrigation management to globally assess agricultural land and water use. Agricultural responses to population and economic growth include considerable increases in irrigated area and water use but reductions in the average water intensity. Different irrigation systems are preferred under different exogenous biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. Negligence of these adaptations would bias the burden of development on land and water scarcity. Without technical progress, substantial price adjustments for land, water, and food would be required to equilibrate supply and demand.

TI  - Socio-Economic Implications of COVID-19 Pandemic in South Asia: Emerging Risks and Growing Challenges
PY  - 2021
AB  - The dramatic spread of COVID-19 has threatened human lives, disrupted livelihoods, and affected trade, economy and businesses across the globe. The global economy has begun to show major disruptions and is heading toward a severe recession with an unprecedented economic crisis. As the global economy is highly integrated and interdependent through the global supply chains, it has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although all countries have faced difficulties due to Covid-19, South Asian countries in particular have had to deal with a more challenging situation due to their large population, weak health facilities, high poverty rates, low socio-economic conditions, poor social protection systems, limited access to water and sanitation, and inadequate living space, necessary to maintain physical distancing and take other required measures to contain this pandemic. To contain the spread of the virus, South Asian countries have imposed stringent lockdowns, which have consequently affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the region, where a third of world's poor live. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the existing and prospective impacts, risks and challenges of Covid-19 on key social and economic sectors including migration, tourism, informal sector, agriculture and rural livelihoods. The analysis revealed that COVID-19 is likely to affect economic growth, increase fiscal deficit and monetary burden, increase the risks of macroeconomic instability, decrease migration and remittance, reduce income from travel and tourism, and result in dwindling micro-small and medium industries and informal businesses. This is likely to deepen poverty and increase unemployment and the risks of hunger and food insecurity. If not addressed properly, this may reinforce existing inequalities, break social harmony, and increase tension and turbulence. The economic and social costs of the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore likely to be significant and long-lasting in South Asia.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation Dams, Agricultural Production, and Health: Theory and Evidence from Ethiopia - Small-scale irrigation dams, agricultural production, and health - theory and evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2005
AB  - The author looks at the feasibility and potential of instituting small-scale irrigation dams to reduce Ethiopias dependence on rainfed agriculture and the associated food insecurity. He develops a theoretical framework to assess the welfare implications of irrigation development programs and provides empirical evidence from microdam construction and reforestation projects in northern Ethiopia. The author pays particular attention to health-related costs of establishing small-scale irrigation dams in areas prone to waterborne diseases. While the theoretical analyses imply that the net welfare impacts of irrigation dams cannot be known a priori due to potential health costs, the empirical evidence shows that current agricultural yield and farm profit have increased in villages with closer proximity to the dams than in those more distant. The increased disease incidence due to standing pools of water has, however, led to significant declines in the returns from investment in irrigation water. Households with poor health are less likely to adopt productivity-enhancing as well as resource-conserving technologies, which are crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable agricultural development. The ensuing sickness has also led to reduction in labor allocation to off-farm activities. The findings underline the importance of weighing beforehand the magnitude of potential economic benefits against health costs of water development programs. The overall evidence, however, suggests that carefully designed irrigation dams could significantly improve agricultural production and food security, particularly in areas where waterborne diseases pose negligible risk to health or can be cost-effectively controlled.

TI  - Capacity development for smallholder irrigation in Kenya
PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper presents the experiences on capacity development for irrigation in Kenya, drawing from a study of seven smallholder irrigation schemes, namely: New Mutaro, Emening, Mitunguu, Ng'uuru Gakirwe, Lari, Mukuria-Kyambogo and Isiolo River Water Users Association. These schemes were selected for their apparent success in irrigation management, sustainability and poverty reduction among the beneficiaries. Although the seven schemes had diverse innovations and enterprises, common drivers of success were identified as: (i) introduction of new knowledge/technology, (ii) availability of markets, (iii) good governance structures, (iv) funding for infrastructure development, and (v) targeted capacity development. It was also found that initial investment costs for smallholder irrigation schemes ranged from about US $198 to $1744 per ha, which is much lower than reported for large public schemes. Generally, all the schemes had recorded improved food security and incomes, with net earnings ranging from US $200 to $1200 per month for single-crop enterprises. Capacity development had played a major role in the positive performance of the schemes. However, the respective schemes had experienced different modes of capacity building, which included government extension services, NGOs, private sector, research institutes, out-grower support schemes and farmer-to-farmer learning. This paper focuses on the role of capacity development. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Improving Policy Coordination Across the Water, Energy, and Food, Sectors in South Asia: A Framework
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land, water, and energy resources are coming under unprecedented pressure owing to growing populations, urbanization, industrialization, and changing lifestyles, food habits and climate. Generally, sectoral approaches are taken to address these challenges that overlook the close linkages between the water, energy and food sectors and resultant cross-sectoral implications. The result is an uncoordinated and unsustainable use of resources that increasingly threatens water, energy, and food securities in many parts of the world. To enhance sustainability in resource use, the use of water-energy-food nexus (WEF) approach has been advocated in recent years. Despite its conceptual appeals, the practical application of this approach in government planning and decision making has remained limited in part due to lack of an appropriate framework to operationalize the concept as a planning and decision-making tool. This paper suggests a framework for operationalizing the nexus concept in planning and decision-making, using South Asia as an example. The framework outlines four steps to evaluate and prioritize nexus issues to improve cross-sectoral planning and coordination using three broad criteria to assess the impact of actions in one sector on another: synergies (co-benefits), trade-offs (externalities), and neutrality. A cross-sectoral coordination body provides the institutional mechanism for ensuring coordination of policy and action. The four steps are: a) harmonizing policy goals, b) identifying interactions and critical connections between these sectors in an integrated manner, c) assessing compatibility of nexus objectives and policy instruments, and d) screening programs, projects, and investments against nexus goals. The framework is expected to help governments in coordinating the actions of diverse actors across the water, energy and food sectors and designing policies and programs that address trade-offs, while increasing production sustainably, conserving natural resources, and enhancing -water-energy-food nexus outcomes.

TI  - Agricultural Decisions after Relaxing Credit and Risk Constraints
PY  - 2014
AB  - The investment decisions of small-scale farmers in developing countries are conditioned by their financial environment. Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer’s own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer’s social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised

TI  - Rich water, poor people: Potential for transboundary flood management between Nepal and India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods in the region straddling Nepal and northern Bihar. Stricken by acute poverty despite being rich in water resources, frequent floods, and shared vulnerabilities across borders, is a grave concern for the communities in the region. This hazard adversely impacts the lives and livelihoods of millions of people especially the poor and marginalised who draw their livelihood from the immediate environment. Hence, there is potential for bringing about positive impacts on the wellbeing of the dependent communities through sustainable actions at a transboundary scale. This paper focusses on the flood-related, transboundary challenges in the Koshi and Gandak river basins. It stresses that the floods have strong upstream-downstream linkages therefore, their management demands joint action at various levels of governance. Transboundary cooperation is essential for developing a relationship of trust and a common understanding to work towards managing floods, especially in downstream areas of Nepal and India. Potential actions for transboundary flood management between Nepal and India are recommended in this paper to enhance the resilience of communities and river basins.

TI  - Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects
PY  - 2010
AB  - The livestock sector globally is highly dynamic. In developing countries, it is evolving in response to rapidly increasing demand for livestock products. In developed countries, demand for livestock products is stagnating, while many production systems are increasing their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Historical changes in the demand for livestock products have been largely driven by human population growth, income growth and urbanization and the production response in different livestock systems has been associated with science and technology as well as increases in animal numbers. In the future, production will increasingly be affected by competition for natural resources, particularly land and water, competition between food and feed and by the need to operate in a carbon-constrained economy. Developments in breeding, nutrition and animal health will continue to contribute to increasing potential production and further efficiency and genetic gains. Livestock production is likely to be increasingly affected by carbon constraints and environmental and animal welfare legislation. Demand for livestock products in the future could be heavily moderated by socio-economic factors such as human health concerns and changing socio-cultural values. There is considerable uncertainty as to how these factors will play out in different regions of the world in the coming decades.

TI  - A Review on the Rising Prevalence of International Standards: Threats or Opportunities for the Agri-Food Produce Sector in Developing Countries, with a Focus on Examples from the MENA Region.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Food safety standards are a necessity to protect consumers’ health in today’s growing global food trade. A number of studies have suggested safety standards can interrupt trade, bringing financial and technical burdens on small as well as large agri-food producers in developing countries. Other examples have shown that economical extension, key intermediaries, and funded initiatives have substantially enhanced the capacities of growers in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to meet the food safety and quality requirements, and improve their access to international markets. These endeavors often compensate for the weak regulatory framework, but do not offer a sustainable solution. There is a big gap in the food safety level and control systems between countries in the MENA region and those in the developed nations. This certainly has implications for the safety of fresh produce and agricultural practices, which hinders any progress in their international food trade. To overcome the barriers of legal and private standards, food safety should be a national priority for sustainable agricultural development in the MENA countries. Local governments have a primary role in adopting the vision for developing and facilitating the implementation of their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) standards that are consistent with the international requirements and adapted to local policies and environment. Together, the public and private sector’s support are instrumental to deliver the skills and infrastructure needed for leveraging the safety and quality level of the agri-food chain.

TI  - Understanding smallholder irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa: results of a sample survey from nine countries
PY  - 2013
AB  - Smallholder irrigation is emerging as a development priority in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on a survey of 1554 smallholders from nine countries, this paper compares rainfed farming with gravity-flow, manual-lift and motor-pump irrigation. Motor-pump-irrigation farmers reported the highest net value added per acre and per family worker, with gravity-flow and manual-irrigation farmers earning marginally more than rainfed-only farmers. In addition to making affordable pumps more readily available, improving the availability of working capital, enhancing security of tenure and ensuring the availability of affordable fuel are all likely to accelerate smallholder irrigation development in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Sustainable land and water management policies and practices: a pathway to environmental sustainability in large irrigation systems
PY  - 2008
AB  - Water cycle, land management, and environmental sustainability are intimately linked. Sustainable land and water management practices are vital for sustaining agricultural productivity and regional development. Unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity constraint over long periods can impose significant costs in terms of lost opportunities in farm production and regional development, say by causing waterlogging and salinity. On-farm and regional salt and water balance dynamics are modeled as a sustainability or carrying capacity constraint, proxied by regional salt and water balance; on-farm land and water management practices are then adjusted to meet the constraint, such that individual actions do not lead to a net change in the ground water and salt balance. Common actions across the farms would achieve the overall environmental sustainability. An irrigated area in southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia serves as a case study example. Integrated hydrologic, economic, agricultural, and environmental models called SWAGMAN series are used to evaluate the impacts of a range of on-farm interventions on farm income and environmental sustainability. The results show that policies such as restrictions on area under certain crops, and tradable groundwater recharge/salinity credits both offer higher total gross margin and net present value than the business as usual scenario, specifically in the long run—win–win options for the farmers and the environment. The modeling results thus confirm the widely held view that unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity can impose significant costs on regional communities. In-depth hydrological and economic analyses are needed to shape and guide society's vision for sustainable land and water management. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Harnessing benefits from improved livestock water productivity in crop–livestock systems of sub-Saharan Africa: synthesis
PY  - 2009
AB  - The threat of water scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa is real, due to the expanding agricultural needs, climate variability and inappropriate land use. Livestock keeping is the fastest growing agricultural sector, partly because of increasing and changing demands for adequate, quality and diverse food for people, driven by growing incomes and demographic transitions. Besides the economic benefits, rising livestock production could also deplete water and aggravate water scarcity at local and global scales. The insufficient understanding of livestock–water interactions also led to low livestock productivity, impeded sound decision on resources management and undermined achieving positive returns on investments in agricultural water across sub-Saharan Africa. Innovative and integrated measures are required to improve water productivity and reverse the growing trends of water scarcity. Livestock water productivity (LWP), which is defined as the ratio of livestock outputs to the amount of water depleted, could be improved through: (i) raising the efficiency of the water inputs by integrating livestock with crop, water and landscape management policies and practices. Improving feed water productivity by maximising transpiration and minimising evaporation and other losses is critical; (ii) increasing livestock outputs through improved feed management, veterinary services and introducing system-compatible breeds; and (iii) because livestock innovation is a social process, it is not possible to gain LWP improvements unless close attention is paid to policies, institutions and their associated processes. Policies targeting infrastructure development would help livestock keepers secure access to markets, veterinary services and knowledge. This paper extracts highlights from various papers presented in the special issue of The Rangeland Journal on technologies and practices that would enable improving water productivity at various scales and the premises required to reverse the negative trends of water depletion and land degradation.

TI  - Implications of middlemen in the supply chain of agricultural products
PY  - 2011
AB  - This paper appraised the roles of middlemen in the distribution of agricultural products and the inherent implications to food security. The results showed that climate and weather are known limiting factors of production in agriculture. Also, middlemen intervention raise price for consumers. The result showed that farmers encounter high production costs in their efforts to boost production but hardly get fair pricing of their products from the middlemen, the bulk farm gate buyers. The real profit goes to the middlemen who buy up the farm products at almost give away prices and sell at outrageous prices to the consumers. This attitude of middle men have discouraged genuine investors getting into agriculture because of the marginal profit associated with it as the middle men cart away the bulk of the profits. Thus, the activities of middlemen seem to be a threat to food security.

TI  - Higher education and economic growth in Africa
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract This paper uses panel data over the 1960–2000 period, a modified neoclassical growth equation, and a dynamic panel estimator to investigate the effect of higher education human capital on economic growth in African countries. We find that all levels of education human capital, including higher education human capital, have positive and statistically significant effect on the growth rate of per capita income in African counties. Our result differs from those of earlier research that find no significant relationship between higher education human capital and income growth. We estimate the growth elasticity of higher education human capital to be about 0.09, an estimate that is twice as large as the growth impact of physical capital investment. While this is likely to be an overestimate of the growth impact of higher education, it is robust to different specifications and points to the need for African countries to effectively use higher education human capital in growth policies.

TI  - The centrality of water resources to the realization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). A review of potentials and constraints on the African continent
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Africa is endowed with vast water resources including but not limited to lakes, rivers, swamps and underground aquifers. However, the way of life in Africa does not reflect this kind of wealth owing majorly to degradation and underutilization of these water resources. This review discusses the centrality of water resources in Africa's pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Following the Sustainable Development Model, the paper thematically examines and synthesizes the importance and potentials of water resources to Africa's development through exploring their contributions and limitations to the various economic sectors namely; agricultural and livestock production, energy, manufacturing and processing, tourism, health, fisheries, trade and other institutional mechanisms such as payment for ecosystem services (PES), mutual cooperation and economic cooperation. Data were collected by review of online peer-reviewed and grey literature published between the year 2000 and 2015. It is observed that sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG 6) will be central to the attainment of all the other SDGs (particularly SDG 1 (No poverty), 2 (No hunger), 3 (Good health), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land)) across Africa. African states should therefore increase their commitment to water conservation and management as this will significantly decide Africa's future development paths.

PY  - 2000
AB  - ABSTRACT Research on two indigenous soil- and water-conservation techniques, Zai and mulching, was conducted in three villages in the Passore province, North Burkina Faso. The aim was to compare them and to assess why farmers choose to apply one, both or none. A total of 55 farmers were interviewed of which 15 applied only Zai, 13 only mulching, 15 both and 12 neither technique. Factor and cluster analysis and students-tests were used to assess relations between farmers knowledge and opportunities and their application of the techniques. Farmers acquired their knowledge through their direct environment. They used the techniques mainly on bush fields, on Zipelle and Zegdega soils, and on dry eroded valley soils but certainly not on wet valley soils. They used them on sorghum and certainly not on legumes. Zai appeared to require more labor than mulching. Farmers applying Zai had larger households, more means of transport and more livestock, which is consistent with their need for manpower and manure. Judged...

TI  - Profitability and productivity barriers and opportunities in small-scale irrigation schemes
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractIrrigation development in Sub-Saharan Africa has lagged significantly behind that in other developing countries. Consequently, economic development and food security are also lagging behind. Since the mid-2000s there has been a resurgence in the willingness to invest in irrigation, and Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest potential of any developing region to benefit from it. However, to gain from new investment in irrigation without repeating past failures, it is critical to develop a business model for small-scale irrigation schemes. This article explores the barriers that such a model needs to address to be successful and the opportunities this represents for irrigators’ profitability.

TI  - Multiple use of irrigation water for improved health in dry regions of Africa and South Asia
PY  - 2007
AB  - In irrigation systems all over the world, water is not only used for the irrigation of agricultural crops, but for a whole range of domestic and other purposes as well. When groundwater is unavailable or of low quality, people may even depend on the irrigation system to provide them with drinking water. Examples from dry regions in different countries have shown that water in irrigation canals is used for laundry mainly on site, while water for domestic purposes is collected for use in the compound. In Morocco and Pakistan special reservoirs have been constructed for the storage of irrigation water for domestic purposes. Often this water is used for cooking and drinking without treatment. While the consumption of untreated surface water poses certain risks to human health, the higher availability of water through the presence of irrigation systems may actually provide health benefits. Water-washed and even water-borne diseases are reduced with increased use of water for personal and domestic hygiene. Adapted design and targeted water management could enhance the health benefits from multiple use of irrigation water and hence increase the value of water for irrigation, or rather, for rural development.

TI  - Planetary boundaries: Exploring the safe operating space for humanity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere <350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (<5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (<4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (<15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of <10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of "planetary boundaries" lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.

TI  - Irrigation, agricultural performance, and poverty reduction in China
PY  - 2006
AB  - The overall goal of our paper is to understand the impact that irrigation in China has had on grain production and incomes, in general, and income and poverty alleviation in poor areas, in particular. The paper seeks to meet three objectives. First, we describe the relationship among irrigation status, yields and household crop revenue. Second, we seek to understand the magnitude and nature of the effect that irrigation has on yields and crop revenue. Finally, we seek to understand the impact that irrigation has on incomes in poor areas. Our analysis shows that irrigation contributes to increases in yields for almost all crops and in income for farmers in all areas. The importance of crop income in poor areas and the strong relationship between crop revenue and irrigation provides evidence of the importance of irrigation in past and future poverty alleviation in China. We also show that in the majority of the villages that invested in new irrigation, returns are positive even after accounting for increases in capital and production costs. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Irrigation water productivity is more influenced by agronomic practice factors than by climatic factors in Hexi Corridor, Northwest China.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Quantifying the influence of driving factors on irrigation water productivity (IWP) is vital for efficient agricultural water use. This study analyzed contributions of agronomic practice and climatic factors to the changes of IWP, based on the data from 1981 to 2012 in Hexi Corridor, Northwest China. Cobb-Douglas production functions were developed by the partial least squares method and contribution rates of the driving factors were calculated. Results showed that IWP and its driving factors increased during the study period, with different changing patterns. IWP was significantly correlated with the agronomic practice factors, daily mean temperature and solar radiation of the crop growing period. The agronomic practice factors including irrigation, fertilization, agricultural film, and agricultural pesticide contributed 20.6%, 32.8%, 42.3% and 11.1% respectively to the increase of IWP; and the contribution rates of the climatic factors, i.e. daily mean temperature and solar radiation, are −0.9% and 0.9%. And the contributions of these factors changed in different sub-periods. It is concluded that agronomic practice factors influenced IWP much more than climatic factors. The improvement of IWP should rely on advanced water-saving technology and application of optimum (need-based) fertilizer, agricultural film and pesticide, ensuring efficient use of agronomic inputs in the study area.

TI  - Livestock water productivity: implications for sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2009
AB  - Water is essential for agriculture including livestock. Given increasing global concern that access to agricultural water will constrain food production and that livestock production uses and degrades too much water, there is compelling need for better understanding of the nature of livestock–water interactions. Inappropriate animal management along with poor cropping practices often contributes to widespread and severe depletion, degradation and contamination of water. In developed countries, diverse environmental organisations increasingly voice concerns that animal production is a major cause of land and water degradation. Thus, they call for reduced animal production. Such views generally fail to consider their context, applicability and implications for developing countries. Two global research programs, the CGIAR ‘Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management and Agriculture’ and ‘Challenge Program on Water and Food’ have undertaken studies of the development, management and conservation of agricultural water in developing countries. Drawing on these programs, this paper describes a framework to systematically identify key livestock–water interactions and suggests strategies for improving livestock and water management especially in the mixed crop–livestock production systems of sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast to developed country experience, this research suggests that currently livestock water productivity compares favourably with crop water productivity in Africa. Yet, great opportunities remain to further reduce domestic animals’ use of water in the continent. Integrating livestock and water planning, development and management has the potential to help reduce poverty, increase food production and reduce pressure on the environment including scarce water resources. Four strategies involving technology, policy and institutional interventions can help achieve this. They are choosing feeds that require relatively little water, conserving water resources through better animal and land management, applying well known tools from the animal sciences to increase animal production, and strategic temporal and spatial provisioning of drinking water. Achieving integrated livestock–water development will require new ways of thinking about, and managing, water by water- and animal-science professionals.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation and Income Distribution in Ethiopia
PY  - 2006
AB  - Irrigation stimulates agricultural productivity and economic growth, but this may come at the cost of growing inequality. Using data at community and household level, this paper analyzes the distributional impacts of irrigation in Ethiopia. Regression analyses reveal the direct effects of irrigation on expenditures and labour demand, and the indirect effects of irrigation on food prices and expenditures of non-irrigation households. The results indicate that past development of irrigation stimulated growth without deepening inequality, and that irrigation decreased dependence on food-for-work programs. Thus, irrigation has played a positive role in the development of Ethiopia.

TI  - Diversification and Livelihood Sustainability in a Semi-arid Environment: A Case Study from Southern Ethiopia +
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract This paper examines the recently growing adoption of non-pastoral livelihood strategies among the Borana pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. A large portion of the current non-pastoral participation is in petty and natural resource-based activities. Pastoral and crop production functions are estimated using the Cobb-Douglas model to analyse the economic rationale behind the growing pastoralist shift to cultivation and other non-pastoral activities. The low marginal return to labour in traditional pastoralism suggests the existence of surplus labour that can gainfully be transferred to non-pastoral activities. An examination of the pastoralist activity choices reveals that the younger households with literacy and more exposure to the exchange system display a more diversified income portfolio preference. The findings underscore the importance of human capital investment and related support services for improving the pastoralist capacity to manage risk through welfare-enhancing diversified income po...

TI  - Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet
PY  - 2015
AB  - The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.

TI  - Consumption Vulnerability to Risk in Rural Pakistan
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract As one of the dimensions of vulnerability, this paper empirically investigates the inability of rural dwellers to cope with negative income shocks. A variable coefficient regression model is applied to a two-period household panel dataset collected in the North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan, an area with high incidence of income poverty and low human development. The empirical model allows for a different ability to smooth consumption, approximated by a linear function of households’ attributes, and controls for the endogeneity of observed changes in income, using qualitative information on subjective risk assessment. Estimation results show that the ability to cope with negative income shocks is lower for households that are aged, landless and do not receive remittances regularly.

TI  - Production Externalities of Education: Evidence from Rural Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Schooling has externality effects in agriculture when, in the course of conducting their own private economic activities, educated farmers raise the productivity of their uneducated neighbours. This paper seeks to determine the potential size and source of such benefits for rural areas of Ethiopia, where school enrolment is low and the private returns to education may not be apparent. Average and stochastic frontier production functions are estimated, including household and community education, as explanatory variables to measure the productivity and efficiency of farmers. In each case, internal and external returns to schooling are compared. We find substantial and significant externality benefits of education in increasing average production and shifting out the frontier. External benefits of schooling may be several times as high as internal benefits in this regard. However, we are unable to find evidence that technical efficiency is subject to externality effects. Our results suggest that adoption and diffusion of innovations that push out the frontier is the source of externalities to schooling. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press.

TI  - Effect of a large dam on malaria risk: the Koka reservoir in Ethiopia
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary Objective To determine whether the Koka water reservoir in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia contributes to the malaria burden in its vicinity. Methods Frequency of malaria diagnosis in fever clinics was correlated with distance of residence from the margin of the Koka reservoir. Annual as well as seasonal malaria case rates were determined in cohorts residing < 3, 3–6 and 6–9 km from the reservoir. Plasmodium falciparum risk was compared with that of Plasmodium vivax. A multiple variable regression model was used to explore associations between malaria case rates and proximity to the reservoir, controlling for other suspected influences on malaria transmission. Results Malaria case rates among people living within 3 km of the reservoir are about 1.5 times as great as for those living between 3 and 6 km from the reservoir and 2.3 times as great for those living 6–9 km from the reservoir. Proximity to the reservoir is associated with greater malaria case rates in periods of more intense transmission. Plasmodium falciparum is most prevalent in communities located close to the reservoir and P. vivax in more distant villages. The presence of the reservoir, coupled with inter-annual climatic variations, explains more than half of the region's variability in malaria case rates. Conclusion Large water impoundments are likely to exacerbate malaria transmission in malaria-endemic parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Objectif Determiner si le reservoir d'eau de Koka dans le Rift Valley en Ethiopie contribue a la charge de morbidite de la malaria dans sa proximite. Methodes La frequence du diagnostic de cas de malaria dans les cliniques de fievre a ete correlee avec la distance de la residence a la berge du reservoir de Koka. Les taux annuels ainsi que saisonniers des cas de malaria ont ete determines dans des cohortes residant a moins de 3, entre 3 et 6 et entre 6 et 9 km du reservoir. Le risque de Plasmodium falciparum a ete comparea celui du P. vivax. Un modele de regression a multiples variables a ete utilise pour explorer les associations entre les taux de cas de malaria et la proximite au reservoir, controlant pour d'autres influences suspectees sur la transmission de malaria. Resultats Les taux de cas de malaria chez les personnes vivant a moins de 3 km du reservoir sont environ 1,5 fois plus eleves que chez ceux vivant entre 3 et 6 km du reservoir et 2,3 plus eleves que chez ceux vivant entre 6 et 9 km du reservoir. La proximite au reservoir est associee a de plus grands taux de cas de malaria dans les periodes de transmission plus intense. P. falciparum est le plus repandu dans les communautes situees pres du reservoir et P. vivax dans des villages plus eloignes. La presence du reservoir couplee aux variations climatiques interannuelles explique plus de la moitie de la variabilite des taux de cas de malaria dans la region. Conclusion Les grands reservoirs d'eau confinee sont susceptibles d'exacerber la transmission de la malaria dans les regions endemiques de l'Afrique subsaharienne. Objetivo Determinar si la reserva de agua de Koka, en el Rift Valley, Etiopia, contribuye a la carga por malaria en su vecindad. Metodos Se correlaciono la frecuencia del diagnostico de malaria en clinicas, con la distancia entre el lugar de residencia del paciente y los margenes de la reserva de Koka. Se determinaron las tasas anuales y estacionales de malaria en cohortes que viven a < 3, 3–6 y 6–9 km de la reserva. El riesgo de Plasmodium falciparum se comparo con el de P. vivax. Se utilizo un modelo de regresion multiple variable para explorar las asociaciones entre las tasas de casos de malaria y la proximidad a la reserva, controlando otros factores sospechosos de influir sobre la transmision de malaria. Resultados Las tasas de casos de malaria entre las personas que viven a 3 km de la reserva son mas o menos 1.5 veces mayores que aquellas para quienes viven entre 3 y 6 km de la reserva y 2.3 veces mayores que para aquellos que viven de 6 a 9 km de la reserva. La proximidad a la reserva esta asociada con mayores tasas de casos de malaria en periodos de mayor intensidad de transmision. P. falciparum es mas prevalente en comunidades que estan localizadas cerca de la reserve, mientras que P.vivax lo es en poblados distantes. La presencia del reservorio, junto con las variaciones climaticas interanuales, explica mas de la mitad de la variabilidad de las tasas de casos de malaria en la region. Conclusion Las grandes reservas de agua podrian exacerbar la transmision de malaria en lugares de Africa Sub-sahariana endemicos para malaria

TI  - Climate Change and Water Availability for Livestock: Impact on Both Quality and Quantity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Water is an essential production factor in agriculture, both for crops and for livestock. Climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture in terms of affecting both water quantity and quality. It is known that changing climate will affect the water resource availability and global hydrological cycle. Livestock particularly in arid and semiarid region are mostly reared under extensive or traditional pastoral farming systems. The animals have different water requirements in different ambient temperatures. The requirement of water varies breed to breed according to their adaptability in a particular region and ambient temperature. Livestock of arid and semiarid region face the problem of water scarcity in most of the time of the year. So the animals need to take adaptive mechanism to overcome the water deprivation in different physiological stages. The animals exhibit several adaptive mechanisms to cope up to the less availability of water. These mechanisms include reduced plasma and urine volume, reduced faecal moisture, reduced body weight and reduced feed intake. The blood biochemical changes include increased haemoglobin, increased blood cholesterol and urea concentration, reduced protein concentration and increased sodium and potassium concentration. The endocrine changes include increased cortisol and reduced insulin, T3, T4 and leptin concentration in livestock. In addition, water deprivation in rumen also plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis in adapted animals. An adequate and safe water supply is essential for the normal and healthy production of livestock. Generally, surface or groundwater is supplied to the animals. This water source should be protected from microorganisms, chemicals and other pollutant contaminations. Keeping in view the adverse water scarcity predicted in the future, strategies have to be developed to improve water-use efficiency and conservation for diversified production system in different locations. More research is needed into water resources’ vulnerability to climate change and in order to support the development of adaptive strategies for agriculture.

TI  - Understanding and promoting adoption of conservation practices by rural landholders
PY  - 2006
AB  - Research on the adoption of rural innovations is reviewed and interpreted through a cross-disciplinary lens to provide practical guidance for research, extension and policy relating to conservation practices. Adoption of innovations by landholders is presented as a dynamic learning process. Adoption depends on a range of personal, social, cultural and economic factors, as well as on characteristics of the innovation itself. Adoption occurs when the landholder perceives that the innovation in question will enhance the achievement of their personal goals. A range of goals is identifiable among landholders, including economic, social and environmental goals. Innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have a high ‘relative advantage’ (perceived superiority to the idea or practice that it supersedes), and when they are readily trialable (easy to test and learn about before adoption). Non-adoption or low adoption of a number of conservation practices is readily explicable in terms of their failure to provide a relative advantage (particularly in economic terms) or a range of difficulties that landholders may have in trialing them.

TI  - Does irrigation water matter for rural poverty alleviation? Evidence from South and South-East Asia
PY  - 2003
AB  - This paper addresses four key questions. What are the irrigation–poverty inequality linkages? Does access to irrigation water matter for rural poverty alleviation? Under what conditions does irrigation have the greatest impact on poverty? What are the pro-poor interventions that can enhance the antipoverty impact of irrigation? Findings from IWMI-led studies and other empirical studies show that: (1) irrigation enables households to improve crop productivity, grow high-valued crops, generate higher incomes and employment, earn a higher implicit wage rate for family labor and, more importantly, benefits the poor and landless through the enhanced availability of food, lower food prices, higher employment and income and other indirect effects; (2) access to irrigation water reduces the incidence and severity of poverty; (3) irrigation's impact on poverty is highest where landholdings are equitably distributed; (4) effective rural poverty alleviation requires that irrigation development be targeted to poor communities; and (5) unequal land distribution is associated with inequitable distribution of agricultural water benefits. We argue that the antipoverty impact of irrigation water can, therefore, be intensified through triggering a set of board and targeted interventions, simultaneously.

TI  - Is the daunting challenge of irrigation achievable
PY  - 2002
AB  - The projections of food and water demand for 2025, which conclude that irrigated areas should increase by 15 to 22%, assume that the productivity of present irrigation should also increase at unprecedented rates. This paper discusses some of the reasons why the contribution of irrigated agriculture to food and fiber production has continued to increase despite the lower level of investments for developing new irrigable areas and the focus on rehabilitation of existing schemes. The shortages of food production projected for the 1990s have been averted because of the explosive exploitation of groundwater and the many-fold increase in water-saving application techniques over the last three decades. However, overexploitation of aquifers and an associated decline in water quality have been occurring in many parts of the developing and developed world, particularly in the semiarid regions. This paper suggests that no further complacency in addressing the long due issue of the poor management practices of the large irrigation systems is acceptable. The failures to understand the links between the technical improvements of the large surface irrigation schemes and required reforms may exacerbate the problem of water scarcity and threaten food security in the future. Development of reliable irrigation in surface systems is crucial to realizing the challenge of irrigation. The magnitude of investments and capacity building in human resources to achieve this goal is likely underestimated. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. RESUME Les etudes sur les previsions de la demande en eau et des besoins alimentaires pour l'annee 2025 concluent que les superficies irriguees doivent s'accroitre de 15 a 22 pour cent. Ces previsions prennent pour hypothese que la productivite des superficies actuellement irriguees devra augmenter a un rythme bien superieur a celui observe dans le passe. Cet article presente quelques-unes des raisons pourquoi la contribution de l'agriculture irriguee a continue de progresser malgre le faible niveau des investissements pour mettre en valeur des nouvelles surfaces irrigables et malgre l'attention portee a la simple remise en etat des perimetres existants. Le deficit de la production alimentaire prevu dans les annees 1990 a ete evite grâce au developpement explosif des eaux souterraines et a l'adoption des techniques economisatrices d'eau dans les trente dernieres annees. Cependant la surexploitation des nappes et la deterioration de la qualite de l'eau souterraine sont apparues aussi bien dans les pays en developpement que dans certains pays developpes, en particulier dans les regions arides. Cet article suggere qu'il n'est plus possible de differer plus longtemps la question de la gestion deficiente des grands perimetres d'irrigation. Ne pas comprendre les liens entre les ameliorations techniques des grands perimetres d'irrigation et les reformes politiques proposees peut contribuer a accentuer les penuries en eau et menacer la securite alimentaire dans le futur. Une meilleure maitrise de l'eau dans les perimetres d'irrigation par canaux est crucial pour relever le defi pose a l'agriculture irriguee. L'ampleur des investissements necessaires et des ressources humaines necessaires pour atteindre cet objectif est probablement sous-estimee. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The 2006 Human Development Report focuses on water and human development. Water is central to the realization of human potential. It is a source of life for people and for the planet. Clean water and sanitation have a profound bearing on health and human dignity. Inequalities in access to clean water for drinking and to water as a productive input, reinforce wider inequalities in opportunity. With competition for water intensifying, there is a danger that poor and vulnerable communities will become increasingly marginalized. The twin challenge facing governments and donors is to accelerate progress towards universal access to water and sanitation; and to ensure that water management policies strengthen the rights of poor households to access water resources.

AB  - AbstractProductivity barriers and opportunities influencing smallholder irrigation sustainability in Zimbabwe were identified using case studies of the Silalatshani and Mkoba irrigation schemes. The major barriers were poor infrastructure and soil fertility, and poor access to farm inputs, farm implements, functioning markets and agricultural knowledge, which resulted in low yields, food insecurity and negative farm income. Most irrigated land remains unused, and marketing of produce is uncoordinated. Mobile technologies provide opportunities for market information dissemination. Institutions are needed to continuously encourage dialogue among agricultural value chain stakeholders to allow irrigators to align their operations to market demands and improve the viability of irrigation systems.

TI  - Farm water and rural poverty reduction in developing Asia
PY  - 2007
AB  - The study on “pro-poor intervention strategies in irrigated agriculture in Asia” by Hussain 2005 shows that, in 26 major and medium-size canal irrigation schemes in Asia, irrigated areas average 20% lower poverty than adjacent rainfed areas; gains are more with pro-poor management of water for farming (PPMWF) and where distribution of farmland or farm water is more equal. These findings, and the measured endorsement of participatory irrigation management (PIM) of these schemes, look robust, though they need to allow for externalities (interaction with groundwater and micro-irrigation; out-of-scheme downstream effects). This paper explores some implications. The diagnosed “inefficiency of gross inequality” in irrigation echoes similar wider-scale findings on aggregate inequality and vulnerability. The choice among irrigation techniques, and science to develop new ones, need to adapt more to the needs of PPMWF. PPMWF planning must itself adapt – as must design of new schemes – to the needs for sustainable water resources, manageable health impacts, and proper treatment of displaced people. Technical and management design to reduce irrigation corruption – as it relates to poverty impact of irrigation, and to PIM – needs more review. The causal links from various types of irrigation to growth, distribution and poverty need more extensive modelling and testing. The important implications of this study (with the above contexts) for major irrigation in Africa – almost certainly essential for major progress against poverty there – need systematic assessment. Finally, some open issues are listed. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. L'etude de « strategies d'intervention en faveur des plus pauvres dans l'agriculture irriguee en Asie » par Hussain 2005 montre que, dans 26 grands et moyens systemes d'irrigation en Asie, les secteurs irrigues ont une pauvrete moyenne inferieure de 20% a celle des zones voisines non irriguees; les gains sont plus eleves avec une gestion « pro-pauvres » de l'eau agricole (GPPEA), et la ou la repartition de la terre ou de l'eau est plus egalitaire. Ces resultats, et l'adoption mesuree de la gestion participative de l'irrigation (GPI) dans ces perimetres, semblent robustes, bien qu'ils ne prennent pas en compte les externalites (interaction avec les eaux souterraines et la micro-irrigation; effets hors perimetres en aval). Cet article explore quelques unes des implications de ces resultats. Le diagnostic « d'inefficacite de l'inegalite » en irrigation fait echo a ce que l'on constate a plus grande echelle sur l'inegalite et la vulnerabilite globales. Le choix et la base scientifique renouvelee des techniques d'irrigation doivent davantage s'adapter aux besoins de la GPPEA. Et celle-ci doit elle-meme tenir le plus grand compte – comme le doit aussi la conception de nouveaux perimetres – du besoin en ressources en eau durables, des impacts sur la sante, et du traitement approprie des personnes deplacees. La conception technique et operationnelle des nouveaux perimetres irrigues en vue de reduire la corruption dans l'irrigation – dans ses interactions avec la pauvrete et la GPI – demande plus d'attention. Les consequences des divers types d'irrigation sur la croissance, la repartition et la pauvrete doivent faire davantage l'objet de modelisation. Les importantes implications de cette etude (dans les contextes indiques ci-dessus) pour la grande irrigation en Afrique – certainement aussi essentielle pour la lutte contre la pauvrete la-bas – ont besoin d'evaluation systematique. En conclusion, un certain nombre de questions sont enumerees. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Transboundary aquifers of Africa: Review of the current state of knowledge and progress towards sustainable development and management
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Study region Transboundary aquifers (TBAs) of Africa. Study focus Review of work on TBAs in Africa, including an overview of assessments and management efforts that have taken place over the last half century. New hydrological insights Seventy-two TBAs have been mapped in Africa. They underlie 40% of the continent, where 33% of the population lives, often in arid or semi-arid regions. TBA inventories have progressed since 2000 and remain work in progress. Despite their importance only eleven TBAs have been subjected to more detailed studies. Cooperation has been formalised for seven TBAs. Most of these TBAs are in North Africa and the Sahel. The recent global Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme compiled information at the national level to describe TBAs in terms of key indicators related to the water resource, socio-economic, and legal and institutional conditions. Availability of data at national level is low, hampering regional assessment. Comparing indicators, from questionnaire surveys, with those from a global water-use model showed variable levels of agreement, calling for further research. Reports on agreements scoping TBA management, indicate that this may be dealt with within international river/lake agreements, but reported inconsistencies between TBA sharing countries also indicate that implementation is limited. Increasing awareness and support to joint TBA management is noticeable amongst international organisations. However, such cooperation requires long-term commitment to produce impacts at the local level.

TI  - TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND COMMERCIALIZATION IN AGRICULTURE: The Effect on the Poor
PY  - 1991
AB  - Do the economic gains brought by technological innovation and commercialization in agriculture work their way through to the poor? The prevailing optimistic view is that they do. But this view is not universal: some hold that these forces for change can interact with, or even induce, institutional and market failure, with adverse consequences for the poor. Adherents of the pessimistic view point to real-world instances in which the poor have failed to reap the benefits, or even have lost, from the technological change or commercialization. Where these effects have occurred we find that they are mostly attributable to inelastic demand or adverse institutional features; often, when technology or commercialization has been blamed for the decline in income of the poor, other-not necessarily connected-policies have in fact been responsible for the damage. This article contends that the optimistic view is, by and large, correct: normally, technology and commercialization stimulate agricultural growth, improve employment opportunities, and expand food supply-all central to the alleviation of poverty. The evidence does not offer much encouragement to an extension of this view-that through "social engineering" the benefits from technology and commercialization can easily be targeted toward the poor; the limited opportunities for such targeting should of course be seized.

TI  - EFFECT OF IRRIGATION AND LARGE DAMS ON THE BURDEN OF MALARIA ON A GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SCALE
PY  - 2005
AB  - Human-made ecologic transformations have occurred at an unprecedented rate over the past 50 years. Prominent among them are water resource development projects. An estimated 40,000 large dams and 800,000 small dams have been built, and 272 million hectares of land are currently under irrigation worldwide. The establishment and operation of water projects has had a history of facilitating a change in the frequency and transmission dynamics of malaria, but analyses of these environmental risk factors are sparse. Here, we present a comprehensive review of studies that assessed the impact of irrigation and dam building on malaria prevalence or incidence, stratified by the World Health Organization's (WHO) sub-regions of the world, and link these studies with the latest statistics on disability adjusted life years, irrigated agriculture, and large dams. We also present estimates of the population at risk due to proximity to irrigation schemes and large dam reservoirs. In WHO sub-regions 1 and 2, which have 87.9% of the current global malaria burden, only 9.4 million people are estimated to live near large dams and irrigation schemes. In contrast, the remaining sub-regions concentrate an estimated 15.3 million people near large dams and up to 845 million near irrigation sites, while here only 12.1% of the global malaria burden is concentrated. Whether an individual water project triggers an increase in malaria transmission depends on the contextual determinants of malaria, including the epidemiologic setting, socioeconomic factors, vector management, and health seeking behavior. We conclude that in unstable malaria endemic areas, integrated malaria control measures, coupled with sound water management, are mandatory to mitigate the current burden of malaria in locations near irrigation or dam sites.

TI  - Can development of water resources reduce poverty
PY  - 2003
AB  - The United Nations Millennium Declaration and resolutions at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development give high priority to poverty reduction in international development agenda for the next decade and a half. It is now widely recognized that water resources development and management play a fundamental role in sustainable growth and poverty reduction. However, investments in water resources development, which were considered a high priority by governments and aid agencies for decades, have fallen drastically. The key question addressed in this paper is: Can water resources development reduce poverty? It examines the impacts of past investments on water resources development and management, (especially on irrigation), on poverty reduction. It is shown that past investments in irrigation development have made a significant contribution to alleviating poverty. In recent years investments made by private farmers in groundwater irrigation may have had a larger impact on livelihoods for poor people than the public investments in large-scale surface water irrigation systems. It is argued that there is not a single silver bullet to reduce poverty though water resources development or management. The best chance for lasting and sustainable impact on poverty is likely to be achieved through a combination of sustainable water resources development, combined with the development of appropriate pro-poor institutions and technologies.

TI  - Irrigation and crop diversification in the 25 de Setembro irrigation scheme, Mozambique
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractCrop diversification is one way of improving the profitability of small-scale irrigation schemes. The 25 de Setembro scheme is an ideal site to analyze diversification, as it is influenced by the markets in Maputo and South Africa. This study uses information gathered from observations, discussions with irrigators and an irrigator survey. Results identified seven irrigator types with different crop diversification strategies predominantly influenced by resource constraints. Most irrigators produce traditional crops, although there are opportunities for growing crops that are more profitable. Improved extension services, to identify cropping strategies that better align with market demand, would improve profitability.

TI  - Impact of best management practices on sustainable crop production and climate resilience in smallholder farming systems of South Asia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract CONTEXT A host of best water and soil management practices (BMPs) hold promise in addressing water scarcity and land degradation to enable sustainable crop intensification in smallholder farming systems. OBJECTIVE This study quantifies the effect of BMPs on crop productivity, income, water saving and water balance components and identifies gaps for future research. METHODS This paper synthesizes the performance of BMPs and the existing data gap by reviewing 108 published studies from the Indian subcontinent which capture a diverse range of rainfall and cropping systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In situ conservation measures helped enhance crop yields by 200–1000 kg/ha, reduced cost of cultivation and enhanced incomes by US$ 10–200/ha/year. The BMPs were helpful in enabling annual water saving in the range of 50 mm to 300 mm by either conserving residual soil moisture or saving irrigation water resulting in enhanced water productivity. Interventions such as direct seeded rice and laser land leveling were found most effective in terms of water saving and in reducing cost of cultivation. On the other hand, ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions helped enhance groundwater recharge by harvesting an additional 50–150 mm of surface runoff which helped increase crop yields, led to sustainable crop intensification and strengthened the number of ecosystem services. Most of the published literature on in situ conservation measures are studies that were carried out at research stations, which show promise of sustainable intensification. However, greater efforts are needed to document learnings from farmer/community scale interventions for effective scaling up. There is also a gap in data availability that hampers a clear understanding of the impact of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions and ecosystem trade-offs; moreover the data available covers short periods and only covers an area of up to 10 km2. We recommend the monitoring of long-term system-level impact indicators to realize the potential of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions in a systems perspective and better grasp the ecosystem trade-offs. SIGNIFICANCE More importantly, the review revealed the ample scope of integrating in situ and ex situ interventions to build system-level resilience in smallholder farming systems in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI  - Transboundary water interaction I: reconsidering conflict and cooperation
PY  - 2008
AB  - Whether the inter-state and sub-national tensions over transboundary waters will lead to greater conflict or increased cooperation remains a hotly debated issue. Most work on the subject situates transboundary water conflict and transboundary water cooperation at opposing ends of a continuum. The examination of either conflict or cooperation, we argue, refutes the reality of the vast majority of contexts where cooperation and conflict actually co-exist, and perpetuates the paradigm that any conflict is ‘bad’, and that all forms of cooperation are ‘good’. The efforts of the international water academic and practitioner communities may be better served through a combined reading of conflict and cooperation as transboundary water interaction. Mirumachi’s Transboundary Waters Interaction NexuS is offered as a robust method demonstrating that simultaneous consideration of conflict and cooperation is both insightful and possible. Transboundary water interaction is shown to be an inherently political process determined by the broader political context. We examine evidence suggesting that uncritical acceptance of traditional forms of ‘cooperative’ arrangements may in fact sustain the conflict it was intended to transform. Several other less well-known faces of ‘cooperation’ are discussed in detail, with examples of narrow, token and coercive cooperation derived from inter-state relations on the Jordan, Nile and Ganges rivers. With a view to paving the way for improved transboundary water sharing and governance, subjectively negative, neutral and positive forms of interaction are defined, and linked with a first approximation of their potential driving forces.

TI  - The case for distributed irrigation as a development priority in sub-Saharan Africa.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Distributed irrigation systems are those in which the water access (via pump or human power), distribution (via furrow, watering can, sprinkler, drip lines, etc.), and use all occur at or near the same location. Distributed systems are typically privately owned and managed by individuals or groups, in contrast to centralized irrigation systems, which tend to be publicly operated and involve large water extractions and distribution over significant distances for use by scores of farmers. Here we draw on a growing body of evidence on smallholder farmers, distributed irrigation systems, and land and water resource availability across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to show how investments in distributed smallholder irrigation technologies might be used to (i) use the water sources of SSA more productively, (ii) improve nutritional outcomes and rural development throughout SSA, and (iii) narrow the income disparities that permit widespread hunger to persist despite aggregate economic advancement.

TI  - What is the irrigation potential for Africa? A Combined Biophysical and Socioeconomic Approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50%, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

TI  - Conservation Agriculture in mixed crop–livestock systems: Scoping crop residue trade-offs in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
PY  - 2012
AB  - Conservation Agriculture (CA) is being advocated to enhance soil health and sustain long term crop productivity in the developing world. One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of CA needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

TI  - Improving water productivity in crop-livestock systems of drought-prone regions: Editorial comment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Crop-livestock systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are mostly rainfall-dependent and based on fragmented marginal lands that are vulnerable to soil erosion, drought and variable weather conditions. The threat of water scarcity in these systems is real, due to expanding demand for food and feed, climate variability and inappropriate land use (Amede et al., 2009). According to recent estimates, farming, industrial and urban needs in developing countries will increase water demand by 40% by 2030 (FAO, 2009). Water shortage is expected to be severe in areas where the amount of rainfall will decrease due to climate change. The lack of capacity of communities living in drought-prone regions to respond to market opportunities, climatic variability and associated water scarcity also results from very low water storage facilities, poverty and limited institutional capacities to efficiently manage the available water resources at local, national and basin scales. The spiral of watershed degradation causes decline in water budgets (Awlachew and Ayana, 2011), decreases soil fertility and reduces farm incomes in SSA (Amede and Taboge, 2007) and reduces crop and livestock water productivity (Descheemaeker et al., 2011). In areas where irrigated agriculture is feasible, there is an increasing demand for water and competition among different users and uses.

The Ethiopian Government considers irrigated agriculture as a primary engine of economic growth and plans to increase the current level of irrigation infrastructure three-fold by the end of 2015. However, there has been concern regarding the performance and management of existing small-scale irrigation. Based on the assessment of 52 small-scale irrigation schemes, and three case study sites, we describe the challenges and interventions required to improve irrigation water management in Ethiopia. Though most schemes are operational, many do not operate at full capacity, due to design failures, excessive siltation, poor agronomic and water management practices, and weak local institutions. In addition to low returns, there is competition for irrigation water between upstream and downstream users, vegetable growers and cereal growers, and between farmers with large irrigable plots and those with small plots. Despite these challenges, our field assessment revealed that small scale irrigation increases crop yields, improves crop diversification, and reduces the risk of crop failure. We emphasize in this paper the need for incentives to improve productivity and minimize conflicts, while enhancing innovation capacity, developing scheme-specific intensification strategies, and promoting collective action. We also describe how benefits from water investments could be substantially increased by overcoming design constraints, strengthening water user associations, and protecting catchments.

TI  - African farmer-led irrigation development: re-framing agricultural policy and investment?
PY  - 2016
AB  - The past decade has witnessed an intensifying focus on the development of irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. It follows a 20-year hiatus in the wake of disappointing irrigation performance during the 1970s and 1980s. Persistent low productivity in African agriculture and vulnerability of African food supplies to increasing instability in international commodity markets are driving pan-African agricultural investment initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), that identify as a priority the improvement in reliability of water control for agriculture. The paper argues that, for such initiatives to be effective, there needs to be a re-appraisal of current dynamics of irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly with respect to the role of small-scale producers’ initiatives in expanding irrigation. The paper reviews the principal forms such initiatives take and argues that official narratives and statistics on African irrigation often underestimate the extent of such activities. The paper identifies five key characteristics which, it argues, contradict widely held assumptions that inform irrigation policy in Africa. The paper concludes by offering a definition of ‘farmer-led irrigation’ that embraces a range of interaction between producers and commercial, government and non-government agencies, and identifies priority areas for research on the growth potential and impact of such interactions and strategies for their future development.

TI  - Water management for sustainable agricultural intensification and smallholder resilience in sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2015
AB  - Water management strategies and allocation policies that support agricultural intensification across agro-ecological zones and hydrologic basins are required for building resilient agrarian communities in sub-Saharan Africa. We provide an overview of the research and investments needed to enhance agriculture in the region, with a focus on technology and institutions, while describing opportunities for improving rainfed crop production. We discuss a range of water management practices in three river basins that were part of the Challenge Program on Water and Food research on Basin Development Challenges from 2009 to 2013. Our main message is that technical and institutional innovations in water management are required for creating and sustaining resilient agrarian communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Such innovations are best designed and implemented in consultations involving researchers, households, investors, and other participants with a management or regulatory responsibility. It is in this collaborative spirit that we introduce this Special Issue of Water Resources and Rural Development, in which several authors present results of studies on agricultural water management in the region, with recommendations for better planning and implementation of interventions to benefit smallholder farmers.

TI  - The effects of irrigation on poverty: a framework for analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

TI  - Stagnant Rivers: Transboundary Water Security in South and Southeast Asia
PY  - 2018
AB  - Transboundary rivers are increasingly difficult to govern and often involve issues of national security, territoriality, and competition. In developing countries, the management and governance of these rivers is dominated by a particular decision making group, often comprised of politicians, bureaucrats, and engineers. These groups perpetrate a technocratic paradigm towards the management of transboundary water, with limited genuine international cooperation. The transboundary water situation in South and Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly fraught as the geopolitical context is changing due to China’s increased involvement in regional issues and climate change. With over 780 million people dependent on these rivers, their governance is vital to regional and international stability. Yet, the technocratic management of transboundary rivers persists and is likely to become increasingly unsustainable and inequitable. A discourse-based approach is applied to consider transboundary water governance in the shifting South and Southeast Asian context. The result is an alternative perspective of why governance approaches on transboundary rivers have resisted meaningful reform.
