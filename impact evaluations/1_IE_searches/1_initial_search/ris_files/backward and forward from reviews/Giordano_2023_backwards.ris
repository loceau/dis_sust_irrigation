TI  - A field of one's own: Gender and land rights in South Asia
AU  - Agarwal, Bina
AB  - This is the first major study of gender and property in South Asia. In a pioneering and comprehensive analysis Bina Agarwal argues that the single most important economic factor affecting women's situation is the gender gap in command over property. In rural South Asia, the most significant form of property is arable land, a critical determinant of economic well-being, social status, and empowerment. But few women own land; fewer control it. Drawing on a vast range of interdisciplinary sources and her own field research, and tracing regional variations across five countries, the author investigates the complex barriers to women's land ownership and control, and how they might be overcome. The book makes significant and original contributions to theory and policy concerning land reforms, 'bargaining' and gender relations, women's status, and the nature of resistance.

AB  - The changes in the various components of the water balance of the Aral Sea, since 1960, and the consequent effects on salinity, surface area and water levels, are described. Since 1989 the fall in level has divided the Aral Sea into two parts, a northern Small Aral Sea and a southern Large Sea. The Small Sea receives part of the inflow of the Syrdar'ya and since 1990 its level has risen and its salinity has declined. To prevent the Small Sea overflowing into the south, a dam was constructed. Although this soon failed, the fauna and flora has begun to recover to some extent in the north Aral Sea. The desirability of a scientific and engineering programme to rehabilitate the northern sea is discussed.

AB  - The past 50–100 years have witnessed dramatic changes in agricultural production and productivity, driven to a great extent by public and private investments in agricultural research, with profound implications especially for the world's poor. In this article, we first discuss how the high-income countries like the United States represent a declining share of global agricultural output while middle-income countries like China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia represent a rising share. We then look at the differing patterns of agricultural inputs across countries and the divergent productivity paths taken by their agricultural sectors. Next we examine productivity more closely and the evidence that the global rate of agricultural productivity growth is declining—with potentially serious prospects for the price and availability of food for the poorest people in the world. Finally we consider patterns of agricultural research and development efforts.

AB  - We examine the effects of water microdams and ensuing waterborne diseases on household decisions in Tigray, Ethiopia, where the government implemented a water resource development programme two decades ago. We find microdams increase productivity of both fuelwood collection and crop production, but the costs of these dams to households can be significant. In villages close to dams, disease prevalence is higher and all household labour categories spend more time sick, and more time is spent by male and female adults caring for sick family members. These can cost the household anywhere in the region of 150–250 Birr per season, depending on the type of labour diversion and the productivity of labour. Males are most significant here. Removing their time from production results in 40–60 per cent higher productivity and income losses compared to diversion of female labour. Sick households also spend significantly more money on health care, especially when male and female adults are sick.

AB  - A study was conducted to understand the effect of different irrigation methods and schedules on morphological, biophysical, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of capsicum (Capsicum annum L.) var. California Wonder. The plants grown under drip irrigation had more number of branches and plant heights compared to that of surface irrigated plants. The total yield was less at lower levels of irrigation. Above ground matter that included stem and leaf dry weight had positive correlation with yield under drip (0.992∗∗) and surface irrigation (0.926∗∗). The carbon dioxide exchange rates varied considerably under different methods of irrigation due to difference in irrigation timings and quantity of water applied. A shift in photosynthetic mechanism was observed in plants under IW/CPE 1.0 treatment. The relationship of WUE and net photosynthesis was also studied. The yield was found to have significant positive correlation with total dry matter (TDM, 0.865∗∗) and net photosynthesis (0.840∗∗). Any factor that could bring in a change in net photosynthesis and TDM may cause variation in yield in capsicum. Root mass was more in surface irrigated crop where as total root length was more in drip irrigated crop. As the quantity of water applied increased the root finesses decreased. Thus drip irrigation at 100% CPE is beneficial for capsicum plant in terms of yield, better plant morphological characters, viz. plant height number of branches, root finesses and root length, etc.

AB  - Irrigation stabilizes agricultural production and hence improves farmers’ living standards and conditions. The permanent presence of water may, however, increase the burden of water-related parasitic diseases and counter the economic benefits of irrigation by reducing farmers’ health. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of malaria on farm household property, beyond the health risk (studied elsewhere). The research question was: by weakening individuals, does malaria reduce productive capacities and income workers, and consequently limit their property accumulation? To test this hypothesis, we use data on property (farming equipment, livestock and durable consumer goods) and Plasmodium falciparum indicators generated by a study carried out in 1998 in the Ivorian savannah zone characterized by inland valley rice cultivation, with a sample of nearly 750 farming households. Property is influenced by many factors related to the size of the family, the area under cultivation and high parasite density infection rate of P. falciparum. A significant negative correlation between high-density infection rate and the property values confirms that by reducing the living standards of households, malaria is a limiting factor for property accumulation.

AB  - This study assessed the potential of the National Fadama (lowland irrigation) facility to enhance smallholder farmers production and income thereby lifting them out of the vicious circle of poverty in South Western Nigeria. About 5% of the participants in Osun State were randomly selected and their performance compared with that of the baseline study conducted before the facility took off. Furthermore, the stochastic frontier production function model was utilized to estimate the technical efficiency level of the participants. Results obtained shows that the farm income obtained from Fadama cultivation increased about three times from #13368.00 at baseline to #38918.00 in the current season. The stochastic production function results obtained shows the coefficients of age of farmer result number of children and farming experience being significant at 1% while the coefficient of cost of seed was significant at 10% level. The range at technical efficiency obtained was 0.9959-0.9964 suggesting a relatively efficient level of production by the participants. The programme thus has a potential to alleviate the participants from poverty.

AB  - Significance
            It is recognized that the risk of malaria in dry areas is increased in the proximity of irrigation infrastructure. Although historical evidence shows that eventually malaria risks subside on the road to greater prosperity and food security, how this comes about remains poorly understood. We studied changes in land use and malaria risk in a large irrigation project in a semidesert region in northwest India. The transition phase we describe, characterized by elevated malaria despite raised control efforts, has already lasted for over a decade. The protracted nature of this transition highlights the need for a long-term commitment by health authorities and international agencies supporting irrigation schemes, to monitor health impacts and sustain control measures.
          , 
            
              In arid areas, people living in the proximity of irrigation infrastructure are potentially exposed to a higher risk of malaria due to changes in ecohydrological conditions that lead to increased vector abundance. However, irrigation provides a pathway to economic prosperity that over longer time scales is expected to counteract these negative effects. A better understanding of this transition between increased malaria risk and regional elimination, in particular whether it is slow or abrupt, is relevant to sustainable development and disease management. By relying on space as a surrogate for stages of time, we investigate this transition in a semidesert region of India where a megairrigation project is underway and expected to cover more than 1,900 million hectares and benefit around 1 million farmers. Based on spatio-temporal epidemiological cases of
              Plasmodium vivax
              malaria and land-use irrigation from remote sensing sources, we show that this transition is characterized by an enhanced risk in areas adjacent to the trunk of the irrigation network, despite a forceful and costly insecticide-based control. Moreover, this transition between climate-driven epidemics and sustained low risk has already lasted a decade. Given the magnitude of these projects, these results suggest that increased health costs have to be planned for over a long time horizon. They further highlight the need to integrate assessments of both health and environmental impacts to guide adaptive mitigation strategies. Our results should help to define and track these transitions in other arid parts of the world subjected to similar tradeoffs.

AB  - This paper presents results of a study on the direct and indirect economic impacts of the Bhakra multipurpose dam system in the northern part of India that has provided direct benefits in terms of hydropower, irrigated agriculture, water supply, flood control and drought prevention. These direct outputs from the Bhakra dam system have, in turn, generated (i) inter-industry linkage impacts, both backward and forward linkages, resulting in increase in the demand for outputs of other sectors, and (ii) consumption-induced impacts arising out of increases in income and wages generated by the direct outputs of the dam. Such indirect economic impacts, quantified by using a fixed-price multiplier model based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Punjab, give a multiplier value of 1.90, indicating that for every rupee (Rs = 100 paise)1 of additional value added directly by the project in the agricultural and electricity sectors, another Rs 0.90 (90 paise) is generated in the form of downstream or indirect effects. The results on income distribution show that the gains to agricultural labour households from the dam have been higher than the gains to other rural households and to urban households.

T2  - Irrigation and Drainage
AB  - Who benefits from irrigation development and who should pay the cost? To answer this question we need to know, in addition to the information on farmers' level benefits, the total irrigation benefits derived by the farm and non-farm sectors in the economy. This question is not well addressed in the literature, therefore, we have estimated both direct benefits (farm-level benefits) and total benefits (rural economy-wide benefits) of irrigation in India. Then we compute irrigation multiplier values, which range from 3 to 4.5. This suggests that about two-thirds or more of the benefits from irrigation development have been accrued to the non-farm sector in the Indian economy, a factor that should be considered in developing a rational cost recovery and irrigation financing policy. But so far the discussions on irrigation financing are mostly farmer-centric, neglecting the total benefits and the semi-public good characteristics of irrigation systems. The empirical information on irrigation multipliers derived here has large implications for public policies such as poverty alleviation and food security in the tropics, where rural livelihoods still largely rely on the productivity and performance of irrigated agriculture.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to quantify the marginal impacts of irrigation and selected input factors on spatial (across 14 states) and temporal (from 1970–1993) variation in the rural poverty level in India. The study uses the head count ratio measure (percent of population below the poverty line) of poverty to evaluate how the poverty level is affected by input factors: irrigation, adoption of HYVs, fertilizer application, rural literacy rate and rural road density. It was found that marginal (incremental) impacts of irrigation followed by the rural literacy rate were larger in explaining the variation of rural poverty level in India than those of other factor-inputs selected. The marginal impact of groundwater irrigation on poverty reduction was larger than that of canal irrigation, which is due to greater control in the application and widespread use of groundwater irrigation than of canal irrigation. Despite mixed findings about the impact of irrigation on poverty from past studies, we have found large-scale marginal impacts of irrigation on rural poverty in India. This quantitative information is expected to be useful for designing targeted poverty alleviation and rural development strategies that also enhance agricultural-productivity growth.

AB  - Maternal and child undernutrition is highly prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, resulting in substantial increases in mortality and overall disease burden. In this paper, we present new analyses to estimate the effects of the risks related to measures of undernutrition, as well as to suboptimum breastfeeding practices on mortality and disease. We estimated that stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth restriction together were responsible for 2·2 million deaths and 21% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for children younger than 5 years. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 0·6 million and 0·4 million deaths, respectively, and a combined 9% of global childhood DALYs. Iron and iodine deficiencies resulted in few child deaths, and combined were responsible for about 0·2% of global childhood DALYs. Iron deficiency as a risk factor for maternal mortality added 115 000 deaths and 0·4% of global total DALYs. Suboptimum breastfeeding was estimated to be responsible for 1·4 million child deaths and 44 million DALYs (10% of DALYs in children younger than 5 years). In an analysis that accounted for co-exposure of these nutrition-related factors, they were together responsible for about 35% of child deaths and 11% of the total global disease burden. The high mortality and disease burden resulting from these nutrition-related factors make a compelling case for the urgent implementation of interventions to reduce their occurrence or ameliorate their consequences.

AU  - Burney, Jennifer A.

T2  - World Development
AB  - Promotion of smallholder irrigation is cited as a strategy for enhancing income generation and food security for sub-Saharan Africa’s poor farmers, but what makes this technology a successful poverty alleviation tool? In the short run, the technology should pave the way for increased consumption, asset accumulation, and reduced persistent poverty among users. Over the longer run, it should lead to institutional feedbacks that support sustained economic development and nutritional improvements. Our conceptual model and review of case studies reveal the importance of three sub-components of irrigation technology—access, distribution, and use—and the ways in which the design of the technology itself can either bridge, or succumb to, institutional gaps. These critical features are illustrated in an experimental evaluation of a solar-powered drip irrigation project in rural northern Benin, which provides a controlled study of technology impacts in the Sudano-Sahel. The combined evidence highlights the technical and institutional requirements for project success and points to two important areas of research in the scale-up of any small-scale irrigation strategy: the risk behavior of water users, and the evolution of institutions that either support or obstruct project replication over space and time.

AB  - Meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population over the next half-century will require technologies that significantly improve rural livelihoods at minimal environmental cost. These technologies will likely be distinct from those of the Green Revolution, which had relatively little impact in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, few such interventions have been rigorously evaluated. This paper analyzes solar-powered drip irrigation as a strategy for enhancing food security in the rural Sudano–Sahel region of West Africa. Using a matched-pair comparison of villages in northern Benin (two treatment villages, two comparison villages), and household survey and field-level data through the first year of harvest in those villages, we find that solar-powered drip irrigation significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season, and is cost effective compared to alternative technologies.

AB  - This paper assesses the additional benefits of a homestead gardening program designed to control vitamin A deficiency in Bangladesh. In February and March 2002, data were collected on the food security and social status of women from 2,160 households of active and former participants in the gardening program and from control groups in order to assess the impact and sustainability of the program. The proportions of active and former-participant households that gardened year-round were fivefold and threefold, respectively, higher than that of the control group (78% and 50% vs. 15%). In a three-month period, the households of active participants produced a median of 135 kg and consumed a median of 85 kg of vegetables, while the control households produced a median of 46 kg and consumed a median of 38 kg (p < .001). About 64% of the active-participant households generated a median garden income of 347 taka (US$1 = 51 taka), which was spent mainly on food, and 25% of the control households generated 200 taka in the same period (p < .001). The garden production and income levels of formerly participating households three years after withdrawal of program support were much higher than those of the control households, illustrating the sustainability of the program and its ability to increase household food security. Significantly more women in active- and former-participant households than in control households perceived that they had increased their economic contribution to their households since the time the program was launched in their subdistricts (> 85% vs. 52%). Similar results were found for the level of influence gained by women on household decision-making. These results highlight the multiple benefits that homestead gardening programs can bring and demonstrate that these benefits should be considered when selecting nutritional and development approaches targeting poor households.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is one of China's most important social, economic, and agricultural regions. Currently, the Plain has 17,950 thousand ha of cultivated land, 71.1 percent of which is irrigated, consuming more than 70 percent of the total water supply. Increasing water demands associated with rapid urban and industrial development and expansion of irrigated land have led to overexploitation of both surface and the ratio of groundwater resources, particularly north of the Yellow River. In 1993, the ratio of groundwater exploitation to recharge in many parts of the NCP exceeded 1.0; in some areas, the ratio exceeded 1.5. Consequently, about 1.06 million ha of water-short irrigated areas in the NCP also have poor water quality. Persistent groundwater overexploitation in the northern parts of the NCP has resulted in water-level declines in both shallow and deep aquifers. According to data from 600 shallow groundwater observation wells in the Hebei Plain, the average depth to water increased from 7.23 m in 1983 to 11.52 m in 1993, indicating an average water-table decline of 0.425 m/year. Water table declines are not uniformly distributed throughout the area. Depletion rates are generally greatest beneath cities and intensively groundwater-irrigated areas. Water-table declines have also varied over time. With the continued decline of groundwater levels, large depression cones have formed both in unconfined and confined aquifers beneath the Hebei Plain. Groundwater depletion in the NCP has severely impacted the environment. Large tracts of land that overlie cones of depression have subsided, seawater has intruded into previously freshwater aquifers in coastal plains, and ground-water quality has deteriorated due to salinization, seawater intrusion, and untreated urban and industrial wastewater discharge. In order to balance groundwater exploitation with recharge, the major remedial measures suggested are to strengthen groundwater management, to raise water use efficiency, to adjust the water-consumed structure, and to increase water supply.

T2  - Acta Tropica
AB  - A comparative assessment of the malaria and schistosomiasis risks associated with surface and sprinkler irrigation systems in Zimbabwe was carried out. The risk assessment of the two diseases was done in accordance with the three standard components of health impact assessment, namely (i) community vulnerability, (ii) environmental receptivity, and (iii) capability of health services to respond to malaria and schistosomiasis. Records of the two diseases were obtained from four health centres serving two surface irrigation schemes and two sprinkler irrigation schemes. For comparison records were also obtained from health centres serving nearby dryland areas. Incidence of schistosomiasis as estimated from recorded new cases of the disease was much higher in surface irrigation schemes than in sprinkler irrigation schemes. For malaria it was the other way around. These findings were confirmed by rapid risk assessments. Malaria risk factors were more prominent in sprinkler irrigation schemes, whereas more schistosomiasis risk factors were identified in surface irrigation schemes. These observations were attributed to poorly maintained infrastructure and inadequate landscape-levelling, which created mosquito breeding sites within the fields in the case of sprinkler schemes, and to poor drainage structures, which created snail-breeding sites in the case of surface-irrigation schemes. Importantly, poor maintenance of sprinkler scheme infrastructure accounted for more disease promoting features than the engineering designs per se. This study demonstrated the value of complementing routinely collected health data with rapid assessment procedures for appraisal of commonly reported diseases.

TI  - The green revolution and poverty: a theoretical and empirical examination of the relation between technology and society
AU  - Das, Raju J.
T2  - Geoforum
AB  - The paper deals with the effects of the green revolution (GR) technology on poverty both conceptually and empirically. It provides a brief overview of the GR debate and then presents a `slice' of this debate in detail – in particular, Lipton's and others' views on the supposed positive and negative benefits of the GR for the poor. The paper then provides a provocative critique of this literature for its underlying neo-Malthusianism of a specific type, for ignoring class issues in the analysis of the GR–poverty relation, and for treating this relation as a necessary relation. It subsequently presents an alternative statement on the GR–poverty issue, arguing that it is class relations that set limit within which population and technology work and affect poverty and that the GR–poverty relation is a contingent one, rather than necessary. In the light of the paper's criticisms and the alternative view it provides, a statistical analysis of the relation between the GR and the population factor on the one hand and poverty level and poverty reduction on the other in India is performed. This analysis is generally consistent with the paper's critique of the Liptonian framework.

TI  - Wittfogel's dilemma: heterarchy and ethnographic approaches to irrigation management in Eastern Africa and Mesopotamia
AU  - Davies, Matthew I. J.
T2  - World Archaeology
AB  - Both ethnographic and archaeological studies have been used to critique Wittfogel's hydraulic theory. These, however, often present data that are contradictory and in need of reformulation. In particular, while ethnographic studies emphasize the management of irrigation in the absence of both socio-political hierarchies and marked social stratification, archaeologists continue to see irrigation agriculture as a key influence on the development of personal accumulation and increased social stratification. Through two East African ethnographic case studies, this paper addresses the mechanisms through which irrigation agriculture might contribute to increased social stratification and cautions against the making of simplistic assumptions. I argue that both ethnographic and archaeological lines of critique have resulted in a hasty rejection of the role played by irrigation management in the formation of loci of authority in early complex societies.

AB  - Small reservoirs in Burkina Faso are constructed for many purposes such as domestic water uses, livestock watering and irrigated rice production downstream of the dam. Increasingly farmers use individually owned motorized pumps to draw water directly from the reservoir and irrigate vegetables upstream of the dam. This practice, while tolerated, is unauthorized and referred to as ‘irrigation pirate’ in French. Upstream vegetable cultivation is successful because it is more profitable than downstream rice cultivation. Often, the ‘unofficial’ irrigated area around the reservoir is much larger than the official command area below the dam. However, in the absence of an overarching authority to manage the water source, this may lead to conflicts and resource degradation. We take the example of the Korsimoro reservoir in Burkina Faso to illustrate the positive and negative impacts of spontaneous individual irrigation around communally managed water bodies.

TI  - Do Differences in the Scale of Irrigation Projects Generate Different Impacts on Poverty and Production?: Impact of Scale in Irrigation Projects
AU  - Dillon, Andrew
T2  - Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - This article investigates differences in household production and consumption among small- and large-scale irrigators to assess whether the scale of an irrigation project increases household welfare in Mali. Much of the evidence of the impact of irrigation does not use counterfactual analysis to estimate such impact or distinguish between the scale of the irrigation projects to be evaluated. In the dataset collected by the author, both a large-scale irrigation project and small-scale projects are used to construct counterfactual groups. Propensity score matching is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for small and large irrigators relative to non-irrigators on agricultural production, agricultural income and consumption per capita. Small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and agricultural income than large-scale irrigation, but large-scale irrigation has a larger effect on consumption per capita. This suggests that market integration and non-farm externalities are important in realising gains in agricultural surplus from irrigation.

AB  - This paper studies the productivity and distributional effects of large irrigation dams in India. Our instrumental variable estimates exploit the fact that river gradient affects a district's suitability for dams. In districts located downstream from a dam, agricultural production increases, and vulnerability to rainfall shocks declines. In contrast, agricultural production shows an insignificant increase in the district where the dam is located but its volatility increases. Rural poverty declines in downstream districts but increases in the district where the dam is built, suggesting that neither markets nor state institutions have alleviated the adverse distributional impacts of dam construction.

AB  - The article explores the role that food gardens can play in contributing to the empowerment of rural South African women. The goal of the study was to focus on likely other benefits - beyond economic advantages - realised by women who participate in the food gardens project. The study was essentially descriptive and qualitative in nature, and focused on a group of women working on a food gardens project in rural Limpopo. Through extensive fieldwork comprising observation and interviews, data were collected on the women’s biographical characteristics, their knowledge of HIV and AIDS, their perceptions of women’s roles, and their experiences of working in the food gardens. Findings indicate that the women gained knowledge and skills at the project that helped them earn a modest income and become more knowledgeable about such issues as HIV and AIDS. Participation in the food gardens encouraged a sense of community, self-worth and indeed a sense of belonging. Although many of the women still found it difficult to deal with issues such as male power and HIV-testing, participation validated their experiences and promoted positive self-perception. They felt able to talk about sex and condom use with their husbands and male partners. The experience offered them opportunities for empowerment via the development of agricultural skills, gaining acceptance amongst peers, building confidence in speaking out and starting to define collective goals.

Results indicate important anthropogenic deterioration. Most of the samples were unsuitable for drinking-water production; animal drinking and irrigation with these waters will require caution. The high contamination is mainly due to the local intensive agriculture. Based on the objectives-oriented project planning method, regulatory and socio-economic instruments were extensively developed to encourage sustainable agriculture through a participatory exercise.

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation Dams, Agricultural Production, and Health: Theory and Evidence from Ethiopia
AU  - Ersado, Lire
T2  - Policy Research Working Papers
AB  - Ersado looks at the feasibility and potential of instituting small-scale irrigation dams to reduce Ethiopia’s dependence on rainfed agriculture and the associated food insecurity. He develops a theoretical framework to assess the welfare implications of irrigation development programs and provides empirical evidence from microdam construction and reforestation projects in northern Ethiopia. The author pays particular attention to health-related costs of establishing small-scale irrigation dams in areas prone to waterborne diseases. While the theoretical analyses imply that the net welfare impacts of irrigation dams cannot be known a priori due to potential health costs, the empirical evidence shows that current agricultural yield and farm profit have increased in villages with closer proximity to the dams than in those more distant. The increased disease incidence due to standing pools of water has, however, led to significant declines in the returns from investment in irrigation water. Households with poor health are less likely to adopt productivity-enhancing as well as resource-conserving technologies, which are crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable agricultural development. The ensuing sickness has also led to reduction in labor allocation to off-farm activities. The findings underline the importance of weighing beforehand the magnitude of potential economic benefits against health costs of water development programs. The overall evidence, however, suggests that carefully designed irrigation dams could significantly improve agricultural production and food security, particularly in areas where waterborne diseases pose negligible risk to health or can be cost-effectively controlled. This paper—a product of the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Sector Unit, Europe and Central Asia Region—is part of a larger effort in the Bank to achieve global food security and poverty alleviation.

Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of “modern varieties” for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions.

Subsidies in credit, fertilizer, and irrigation have been crucial for small farmers to adopt new technologies particularly during the initial stage of the green revolution in the late 1960s and 1970s. But it is now investments in agricultural research, education, and rural roads that are the three most effective public spending items in promoting agricultural growth and reducing poverty.

T2  - Agriculture & Food Security
AB  - With the global population expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, there is a continuous need to increase food production and buffer stocks. In this scenario, countries around the world, especially developing countries where the pervasiveness of hunger and food scarcity is more acute, are resorting to various counter strategies to meet the growing demand and to avert food insecurity and famine. Over the recent years there has been growing interest to strengthen and intensify local food production in order to mitigate the adverse effect of global food shocks and food price volatilities. Consequently, there is much attention towards home gardens as a strategy to enhance household food security and nutrition. Home gardens are an integral part of local food systems and the agricultural landscape of developing countries all over the world and have endured the test of time.

Through a rigorous literature review, this paper first examines definitions and characteristics of home gardens and then provides a global review of their social, economic, and environmental contributions to communities in various socio-economic contexts. Many of the compositions on home gardens share research and experiences of developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These studies recognize positive impacts of home gardens towards addressing food insecurity and malnutrition as well as providing additional benefits such as income and livelihood opportunities for resource-poor families and delivering a number of ecosystem services. However, only a handful of case studies were found on post-crisis settings. While providing a general overview of some of these studies, this review investigates the home garden experiences of post-conflict Sri Lanka, where home gardening has been practiced for centuries. While emphasizing multiple benefits, we also highlight constraints to home garden food production. In conclusion, we emphasize the need for more research and empirical data to appraise the role of home gardens in crisis and post-crisis situations, as well as assessing their economic value and their impacts on food security, nutrition, economic growth, and gender issues.

AB  - The regional government of Tigray has invested millions of dollars to develop irrigation schemes as a strategy of poverty reduction. However, there has been limited attempt to analyze whether these investments have attained their stated objectives of poverty reduction and overall socio-economic enhancement. Therefore, we endeavor to: (1) evaluate the impacts of access to small-scale irrigation on farm household's income and poverty status, (2) contribute to the scant literature on irrigation and poverty reduction in Ethiopia, and (3) provide information for policy makers. We examine a representative sample of 613 farm households (331 irrigators and 282 non-irrigators) drawn using three-stage stratified sampling with Probability Proportional to Size. We find that the average income of non-irrigating households is less than that of the irrigating households by about 50%. The overall average income gain due to access to irrigation ranges from 4000 Birr to 4500 Birr per household per annum. We find also that farming income is more important to irrigating households than to non-irrigating households, and off-farm income is negatively related with access to irrigation.

Irrigated farms are on a higher production frontier with significant inefficiencies, while rain-fed farms are on a lower production frontier with high efficiency levels. Thus, there is considerable potential for increasing outputs by improving the efficiency of irrigation farms. Rain-fed systems need interventions in soil moisture management to move to a higher production frontier. The study underlines the need for correcting the sequence and mix of yield boosting technologies such as irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizer that are promoted in arid environments such as Tigray. We recommend that water control must precede or implemented in tandem with improved seeds and fertilizer technologies. Unless soil moisture is improved by investing in moisture improving technologies, the use of seed and fertilizer in moisture stressed areas such as Tigray may have adverse effects.

AB  - Use of industrial and wastewater for irrigation is on the rise in India and other developing countries because of scarcity of good-quality irrigation water. Wastewaters contain plant nutrients that favour crop growth but leave a burden of heavy metals which can enter the food chain and is a cause of great concern. The present study was undertaken on the long-term impact of irrigation with treated sewage water for growing vegetables and the potential health risk associated with consumption of such vegetable. Treated sewage water (TSW), groundwater (GW), soil and plant samples were collected from peri urban vegetable growing areas of Northern India (Varanasi) and analysed to assess the long-term effect of irrigation with TSW on Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb build-up in soils and its subsequent transfer into commonly grown vegetable crops. Results indicate that TSW was richer in essential plant nutrients but contained Cd, Cr and Ni in amounts well above the permissible limits for its use as irrigation water. Long-term application of TSW resulted in significant build-up of total and DTPA extractable Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb over GW irrigated sites. TSW also resulted in slight lowering in pH, increase in organic carbon (1.6 g kg − 1) and cation exchange capacity (5.2 cmol kg − 1). The tissue metal concentration and relative efficiency of transfer of heavy metals from soil to plant (transfer factor) for various groups of vegetables were worked out. Radish, turnip and spinach were grouped as hyper accumulator of heavy metals whereas brinjal and cauliflower accumulated less heavy metals. Health risk assessment by consumption of vegetables grown with TSW indicated that all the vegetables were safe for human consumption. However, significant accumulation of these heavy metals in soil and plant needs to be monitored.

AB  - Following the publication in 1993 of the World Bank ' s policy paper on " Water Resources Management, " the World Bank Institute/Learning and Leadership Center initiated a training program on water policy reform, based on the principles outlined in the policy paper. A series of national, regional, and international seminars was organized to disseminate best practices in water resources management and to stimulate high-level policy dialogue on policy options in the water sector. Within the irrigation subsector, the WBI training program focused on policies that encourage participation of the irrigation users in managing the irrigation systems on which their livelihoods depend. While the basic principles of PIM (participatory irrigation management), outlined in chapter 1,seem intuitively sound and even obvious, there are surprisingly few cases in which PIM policies are adopted and fully implemented on a national level. This report comprises studies of situations where PIM seem to have worked. Case studies focus on Mexico, Turkey, Colombia, and the Philippines. These studies resulted from a collaboration between the WBI and the International Water Management Institute. They address the political antecedents of PIM polices, the process of implementing the policies, and the second-generation challenges of sustaining PIM.

AB  - The effects of municipal wastewater irrigation on the accumulation of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni) in soil and vegetables were investigated by monitoring wastewater-irrigated agricultural field of Titagarh, 24-Parganas (North), West Bengal, India. The mean concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cu in the irrigation water and the mean Cd content in soil were much above the recommended level. The concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni in all the examined vegetables were beyond the safe limits. The study reveals that heavy metal-contaminated vegetables grown in wastewater-irrigated areas may pose public health hazards.

AB  - We conducted a series of studies on the northern Pacific coast of Peru to determine environmental risk factors for malaria. We report in this paper the results of both a descriptive study of incidence and a prevalence survey of malaria. Both studies showed that the area was at low risk for malaria. The malaria incidence rate was 40/1000 p.a. during the study period, and the prevalence of infection was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4–1.7) before and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.8–2.2) after the high incidence period. However, the risk of malaria varied according to season, village and even house within a single village. Incidence rates increased from February (2.6/1000 p.a.) to May (12.9/1000 p.a.) and decreased during the second part of the year. Most of the cases were clustered in four villages that constituted only 21% of the total population of the area. Houses where multiple cases were recorded were often located near a source of water. Our observations suggested that environmental factors, and particularly the presence of water for irrigation around villages and houses, played a major role in determining the risk of malaria. These observations were extended through an entomological study and a case–control study, to be published elsewhere.

T2  - Agricultural Systems
AB  - This paper explores agriculture and nutrition linkages in Bangladesh, a country that achieved rapid growth in rice productivity at a relatively late stage in Asia's Green Revolution, as well as unheralded progress against undernutrition. To do so, we first outline a simple conceptual model to identify the different impacts that productivity growth in a food staple(s) might have on child nutrition outcomes, with a particular focus on changes in diets at the household and child level. We then apply this framework to a descriptive overview of the evolution of Bangladesh's food system in recent decades. We show that this evolution is characterized rapid growth in yields and calorie availability, but relatively sluggish diversification in both food production and consumption, despite increasing reliance on imports for dietary diversification. Next, we create a multi-round district level panel that links changes in nutrition survey data with agricultural sample survey data over 1996–2011, a period in which rice yields rose by more than 70%. We then use this panel to more rigorously test for associations between yield growth and various anthropometric and child feeding indicators. Consistent with our descriptive evidence on dietary changes, we find that rice yields predict the earlier introduction of complementary foods to young children (most frequently rice) as well as increases in their weight-for-height, but no improvements in their dietary diversity or height-for-age. Since Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child wasting in the world, these significant associations between yields and child weight gain are encouraging, but the lack of discernible effects on children's dietary diversity or linear growth is cause for concern. Indeed, it suggests that further nutritional impacts will require diversifying the Bangladeshi food basket through both supply and demand-side interventions.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of irrigation on rural incomes, poverty and the income distribution in rural China. The relationship between irrigation and income is examined using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis. A simulation approach is used to explore the impact of irrigation on poverty incidence. To uncover the effect of irrigation on the income distribution, inequality is decomposed by source of income, by group according to access to irrigation and by estimated income flows as a result of specific household characteristics. The results show that irrigation increases income and reduces poverty and inequality.

TI  - Direct and indirect benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation: evidence and lessons
AU  - Hussain, Intizar
T2  - Irrigation and Drainage
AB  - This paper is a part of the multi-country study carried out by the author at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with national partners in six Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) during 2001–2002. Based mainly on primary data collected from 5400 households in 26 irrigation systems, the study examines in detail the benefits and potential disbenefits of irrigation. The results indicate that irrigation benefits vary widely across systems, and depend on a range of factors including local conditions, system management, irrigation policy, and broader economic and political factors. The study suggests that indirect irrigation benefits could be larger than direct benefits through the multiplier effect. The distribution of irrigation benefits also varies widely by type of the benefit and the socio-economic status of the beneficiaries. The direct benefits generally accrue to landholders while a significant part of the indirect benefits accrue to the landless and small farmers, positively contributing to their livelihoods. Further, the overall benefits of irrigation are large when irrigation- improving interventions, investments in infrastructure, improvements in system management and service delivery to farmers, are implemented in an integrated manner.

On the other hand, the paper also suggests that irrigation can also lead to some negative or adverse social, health and environmental impacts. Such potential disbenefits of irrigation include displacement of people as a result of new irrigation development, public health risks from water-related diseases, irrigation-induced land and water degradation, loss of biodiversity and river health risks from increased river water withdrawals for irrigation. Often, negative social and environmental consequences adversely affect the poor more than the non-poor people. Most potential adverse impacts of irrigation are not due to irrigation water per se, but due to inadequacies and ineffectiveness of institutions and management to address them. Moreover, many of the potential adverse impacts can be avoided or minimized with effective planning, design and management of the projects.

TI  - Irrigation and poverty alleviation: review of the empirical evidence
AU  - Hussain, Intizar
AU  - Hanjra, Munir A.
T2  - Irrigation and Drainage
AB  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the linkages between irrigation and poverty by offering an objective review of recent research on the subject. The key questions addressed herein are: (1) what is the role of irrigation development and management in poverty alleviation? (2) what are the linkages and pathways through which irrigation contributes to poverty alleviation? (3) what is the magnitude of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? and (4) what are key determinants of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? Our review focuses on topical empirical research studies in Asia.

The extensive review suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation and poverty. These linkages are both direct and indirect. Direct linkages operate via localized and household-level effects, and indirect linkages operate via aggregate or subnational and national level impacts. Irrigation benefits the poor though higher production, higher yields, lower risk of crop failure, and higher and year-round farm and nonfarm employment. Irrigation enables smallholders to adopt more diversified cropping patterns, and to switch from low-value subsistence production to high-value market-oriented production. Increased production makes food available and affordable for the poor.

The indirect linkages operate via regional, national, and economy-wide effects. Irrigation investments act as production and supply shifters, and have a strong positive effect on growth, benefiting the poor in the long run. Further, irrigation benefits also accrue to the poor and landless in the long run, although in the short run relative benefits to the landless and land-poor may be small, as the allocation of water often tends to be land-based. Despite that, the poor and landless benefit, in both absolute and relative terms, from irrigation investments. Recent advances in irrigation technologies, such as micro-irrigation systems, have strong anti-poverty potential.

Ongoing studies in Asian countries document strong evidence that irrigation helps to alleviate both permanent and temporary poverty. Further, it helps to alleviate poverty in its worst forms, namely chronic poverty. In general, irrigation is productivity enhancing, growth promoting, and poverty reducing. Instances of negative externality effects associated with large and medium-scale irrigation systems point to management issues, and therefore call for more comprehensive response mechanisms from the planning and the political community alike. The anti-poverty impacts of irrigation can be intensified by creating conditions or enabling environments that could achieve functional inclusion of the poor. These include: (1) equitable access to land; (2) integrated water resource management; (3) access to and adequacy of good quality surface and groundwater; (4) modern production technology, (5) shift to high-value market-oriented production; and (6) opportunities for the sale of farm outputs at low transaction costs. The benefits of irrigation to the poor can be intensified by initiating broader level and targeted interventions simultaneously.

TI  - Impact of irrigation on malaria in Africa: paddies paradox: Irrigation and malaria vectors in Africa
AU  - Ijumba, J. N.
AU  - Lindsay, S. W.
T2  - Medical and Veterinary Entomology
AB  - The high population growth rate of the African continent has led to an increased demand for food and is in danger of outstripping agricultural production. In order to meet this need, many governments have sought ways of improving food production by initiating large-scale irrigation projects, involving reclamation of arid and semi-arid areas for the cultivation of crops. Although crop irrigation promises one solution to alleviating hunger and encourages economic growth, irrigation has often been blamed for aggravating disease in local communities. Malaria is one of the major tropical diseases associated with irrigation schemes, and changes in the transmission pattern of this disease following irrigation development have been a perennial subject of debate. It has often been assumed that high numbers of malaria vector Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) resulting from irrigation schemes lead inevitably to increased malaria in local communities. However, recent studies in Africa have revealed a more complex picture. Increased numbers of vectors following irrigation can lead to increased malaria in areas of unstable transmission, where people have little or no immunity to malaria parasites, such as the African highlands and desert fringes. But for most of sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is stable, the introduction of crop irrigation has little impact on malaria transmission. Indeed, there is growing evidence that for many sites there is less malaria in irrigated communities than surrounding areas. The explanation for this finding is still unresolved but, in some cases at least, can be attributed to displacement of the most endophilic and anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles funestus Giles by An. arabiensis Patton with lower vectorial capacity, as the latter thrives more than the former in ricefields. Similarly, among members of the An. gambiae complex, some cytotypes of An. gambiae sensu stricto are more vectorial than others. For example, the Mopti form has high vectorial capacity and breeds perennially in irrigated sites, whereas the savanna form is often sympatric but more seasonal. Also we suggest that many communities near irrigation schemes benefit from the greater wealth created by these schemes. Consequently irrigation communities often have greater use of bednets, better access to improved healthcare and receive fewer infective bites compared with those outside such development schemes. Thus, in most cases, irrigation schemes in Africa do not appear to increase malaria risk, except in areas of unstable transmission. However, developers should take the opportunity to improve health-care facilities for local communities when planning irrigation schemes wherever they occur.

AB  - Biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of pre and post dam construction were assessed in one of the arid regions of Iran commanded by Minab dam. The methodology used in this study was drawn from the international organizations especially the World Commission on Dams and the United Nations for selection of the indicators for sustainable development relating to water resources projects. Commissioning of the dam in 1986 led to progressive expansion of the irrigated agriculture, which was almost doubled in year 2006. Results of the study revealed that there is significant positive impact of the irrigation infrastructures of the dam; for example literacy rate has increased from 41 % (pre project) to 74 % in 2006. Similarly, significant improvements were observed in health care, sanitation, education and other scopes. Nevertheless, for some of the targets only 50–60 % progress were made, whereas no significant achievements had been made in the others. Therefore, development did not match with the planned goals of the project. Deficiency in achieving the primary objectives, especially after many years of project completion, may be attributed to the management and implementation of the project. For effective project performance, a new institutional framework and guide lines are proposed in this article.

AB  - In spite of raising Asian per capita food production by 27% and making India food self-sufficient, the Green Revolution has received much criticism for its environmental and socio-economic impacts. Taking on board post-development critiques of ‘speaking for’ Third World ‘others’, this paper seeks to examine the Green Revolution from the points of view of people directly affected by it. Comparative, historically-informed research in three villages for which 1972 baseline data exist reveal that the Green Revolution has ensured, in the words of one marginal farmer that ‘nobody sleeps with an empty stomach nowadays’. Most villagers associate the Green Revolution with increases in living standards and weakening community-based wealth hierarchies. Nevertheless, socio-economic inequalities between certain Scheduled Castes and other villagers are still very apparent.

AB  - As part of their irrigation strategy, the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malawi are actively promoting the use of treadle pumps in smallholder irrigation. The positive impact of treadle pumps on food security and poverty reduction in Malawi and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa is well documented. However, few studies have analysed the adoption dynamics and dissemination approaches of treadle pumps. This study uses a logit model to analyse the factors influencing treadle pump adoption among a stratified random sample of 100 adopters and 100 non-adopters in two districts in Malawi. The results indicate that relatively well-off farmers have a significantly higher probability of adopting the treadle pumps than poor farmers. This raises questions about dissemination approaches and targeting, because treadle pumps are typically geared towards poor smallholders. The study further indicates differences between male and female adopters. Female adopters are more likely to pay for subsidized treadle pumps in cash. Male adopters mostly acquire their pumps through a loan. Women tend to spend the additional income on food for the household while men tend to spend it mostly on non-food items. It is therefore likely that treadle pump adoption by women will positively impact on household food security, though it also adds to women's workload.

Socio-economic data were collected from household heads and key agricultural and health informants through interviews and questionnaires. Larval and adult mosquitoes were sampled during the dry and short wet seasons of 2006. Female anopheline mosquitoes were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for blood meal sources and sporozoite infections.

Results Malaria prevalence was higher in the irrigated village (19%, P < 0.05) than the non-irrigated village (16%). In the irrigated village, malaria prevalence was higher in the dry season than in the wet season while the reverse occurred in the non-irrigated village. Households with access to irrigation had larger farm land sizes and higher incomes, but also higher prevalence of malaria. Larval and adult abundance of the malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles pharoensis, was higher in the irrigated than in the non-irrigated village throughout the study period. Furthermore, the abundance of An. pharoensis was significantly higher than that of An. arabiensis during the dry irrigated period of the year. Canal leakage pools, irrigated fields and irrigation canals were the major breeding habitats of the two vector mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates of 1.18% and 0.66% were determined for An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis in the irrigated village. Peak biting activities of the vectors occurred before 22:00 h, which is a source of concern that the effectiveness of ITNs may be compromised as the mosquitoes feed on blood before people go to bed.

Conclusion Irrigation schemes along the Ethiopian Rift Valley may intensify malaria by increasing the level of prevalence during the dry season. To reduce the intensity of malaria transmission in the small-scale irrigation schemes currently in operation in Ethiopia, year-round source reduction by using proper irrigation water management, coupled with health education, needs to be incorporated into the existing malaria control strategies.

T2  - Public Health Nutrition
AB  - Objective
To evaluate the long-term effects of a horticultural and nutrition education intervention in rural Tanzania.

Design
A quasi-experimental post-test design was used.

Setting
The research was carried out in 10 villages in Singida region, Tanzania.

Subjects
Mothers and their children aged 6–71 months (n = 236) from an experimental (Ilongero) and control (Ihanja) area were interviewed regarding knowledge and practices related to vitamin A nutrition. Intake of vitamin A-rich foods by the children during the 7 days prior to the interview was recorded. Stools were examined for helminths and serum samples were analysed for retinol and C-reactive protein (CRP) (n = 146) for the children aged 12–71 months.

Results
Knowledge and practices were more favourable to vitamin A intake in the experimental area than in the control area, and an increased frequency of intake of green leaves was associated with higher serum retinol values. The experimental area had lower mean serum retinol levels (13.7 μg dl−1, n = 75) than the control area (19.3 μg dl−1, n = 71). One likely confounder was the higher helminth infestation in the experimental area (n = 75, 79%) than in the control area (n = 71, 49%) (P > 0.001). Children with helminths (n = 94) had a lower mean serum retinol level than those without (n = 52) (12.3 ± 5 vs. 24 ± 10 μg dl−1; P = 0.001).

Conclusions
Food-based vitamin A programmes can make sustainable improvements in knowledge and dietary practices but these may not necessarily be reflected in increases in serum retinol. Programme implementation and evaluation should take confounders into consideration as, in this case, helminth infestation.

AB  - Malaria in Sri Lanka is unstable and epidemic, with large spatial and temporal differences in transmission dynamics. The disease is of great public health significance and identification of underlying risk factors is important in order to use the limited resources in a cost-effective way. The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) recently launched a project of GIS-based malaria risk mapping in Sri Lanka, to investigate whether this tool could be used for epidemic forecasting and for the planning of malaria control activities. This paper presents results for the Uda Walawe region in southern Sri Lanka, an irrigated agricultural area where malaria cases were mapped at the smallest administrative level for each month over a 10-year period. Malaria incidence rates were related to land- and water-use patterns, socio-economic features, and data on malaria control interventions in a multivariate analysis. Areas of high malaria risk were characterized by: (i) higher than average rainfall, (ii) greater forest coverage; (iii) slash and burn cultivation as a predominant agricultural activity; (iv) presence of many abandoned irrigation reservoirs; and (v) poor socio-economic status. Irrigated rice cultivation areas had a lower risk of malaria than non-irrigated areas. This difference could be due to socio-economic factors related to irrigation development and/or transmission dynamics related to vector density or species composition. Our findings call for malaria control strategies that are readily adapted to different ecological and epidemiological settings. Malaria risk maps are a convenient tool for discussing targeted and cost-effective interventions with disease control personnel.

AB  - Summary We surveyed Nongceng, a village in a south-eastern province of Lao PDR, for malaria and its vectors. Nongceng is situated in a basin and surrounded by rice fields. In February 1998 (dry season), 28.6% of 126 villagers were infected with malaria, and in September 1998 (rainy season), 16.3% of 147 villagers. The prevalence of malaria infection was consistently high in children under 10, and the predominant malaria species was Plasmodium falciparum. In brief surveys of the mosquitoes performed on the same day as the malaria surveys, 2007 Anopheles females from 12 species were collected by means of human bait, animal bait and resting collections. Of the vector species known to be important in transmitting malaria in neighbouring Thailand –An. minimus, An. dirus, and An. maculatus groups – only An. minimus was found. Its density was, however, very low in both seasons and it was therefore unlikely to be the vector. In fact, An. nivipes accounted for more than 65% of all mosquitoes collected and was the most common species collected from human baits. The results of this study show that endemic areas of malaria in Lao PDR are not necessarily related to forest. Rather, An. nivipes is suspected to be the most important vector.

AB  - Traditionally, engineering and environment-based interventions have contributed to the prevention of malaria in Asia. However, with the introduction of DDT and other potent insecticides, chemical control became the dominating strategy. The renewed interest in environmental-management-based approaches for the control of malaria vectors follows the rapid development of resistance by mosquitoes to the widely used insecticides, the increasing cost of developing new chemicals, logistical constraints involved in the implementation of residual-spraying programs and the environmental concerns linked to the use of persistent organic pollutants. To guide future research and operational agendas focusing on environmental-control interventions, it is necessary to learn from the successes and failures from the time before the introduction of insecticides. The objective of this paper is to describe the experiences gained in Asia with early vector control interventions focusing on cases from the former Indian Punjab, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The paper deals primarily with the agricultural engineering and land and water management vector control interventions implemented in the period 1900–1950. The selected cases are discussed in the wider context of environment-based approaches for the control of malaria vectors, including current relevance. Clearly, some of the interventions piloted and implemented early in the last century still have relevance today but generally in a very site-specific manner and in combination with other preventive and curative activities. Some of the approaches followed earlier on to support implementation would not be acceptable or feasible today, from a social or environmental point of view.

AB  - An Investigation on irrigation performance assessment of Mudimanikyam and Janpahad major, Left bank canal, Nagarjuna Sagar Project (NSP), Andhra Pradesh, India using remote sensing and GIS was carried during rabi (2008-09 and 2009-10) at Water Technology Center, ANGRAU, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad. Multi temporal remote sensing (RS) data-based crop inventory and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is very sensitive to the presence of the green vegetation and is a ratio of near infrared radiation minus red radiation and near infrared ratio plus red radiation. The NDVI was generated for Mudimanikyam and Janpahad major command of NSP, using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Linear Imaging and Self Scanning–III (LISS-III) data. In this study, remote sensing based indicators ie., irrigation intensity( target value of 100%), water utilization index (WUI), depth of water applied, overall consumption rate (ep), relative water supply (RWS), output per unit cropped area ($/ha), output per unit cultivable command ($/ha) and water productivity (wp) were estimated for the command area. This study demonstrates how the remote sensing based estimates of crop area and production combined with water release data from project and climatic data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. These parameters varied from 92.39 to 123.19 for irrigation intensity against target of 100 per cent, 86.04 to 148.96 for WUI against the target of 141.24 ha Mcum-1 of wet crop, 0.40 to 0.80 for ep, against target of 0.56, 0.42 to 0.75 for RWS against target value of 2.0 and 0.152 to 0.203 for wp against value of 0.35 kg m-3 during rabi 2008-09 and 2009-10, respectively. These performance indicators showed that irrigation performance of Janpahad major was better than Mudimanikyam. The ep indicators for the majors during rabi 2009-10 were lower (0.40 and 0.52) than the target value and WUI was higher for Janpahad major during both the years.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research
AB  - [1] We find that irrigation significantly affects Asian summer climate, according to model simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3.0) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM3.5). Irrigation over the major river basins in the Middle East and central Asia causes a decrease in sensible heat fluxes and an increase in latent heat fluxes in boreal summer. These changes in heat fluxes lead to a cooling of both the surface and the lower troposphere over the irrigated regions. This atmospheric cooling, in turn, results in a cooling of the layer-averaged temperature (thickness temperature) in the troposphere. The irrigation-induced cooling in the troposphere, therefore, significantly decreases the tropospheric geopotential height over the irrigated regions. Lower height in the upper troposphere alters the upper-level atmospheric circulation over the irrigated and surrounding regions in Asia. Cyclonic differences of atmospheric circulation are simulated around negative differences of height and positive differences of vorticity between the irrigated and control runs, and they result in a weakening of the upper-level anticyclonic circulation over the tropical to midlatitude African-Asian regions. These changes in atmospheric circulation lead to a weakening of the strong upper-level westerly jet (Asian jet) over eastern Europe, the Middle East, and central Asia in 40°N ∼ 55°N. The irrigation impacts on the atmospheric circulation and Asian jet in boreal summer are supported by a comparison with observations.

T2  - Journal of Great Lakes Research
AB  - Whole Farm Planning was instituted and monitored over a 5-year period within the Graywood Gully sub-watershed of Conesus Lake, NY (USA). An array of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) (strip cropping, fertilizer reduction, tiling, manure disposal practices, etc.) were simultaneously introduced to determine the impact of a concentrated management effort on nutrient and soil loss from one watershed within the Conesus Lake catchment. During the study period, significant decreases in winter concentrations of dissolved and particulate fractions, including total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and nitrate (NO3) but not total suspended solids (TSS), were observed. These decreases may or may not be attributed to cessation of manuring practices. Three years into the study, an opportunity existed to test the responsiveness of the watershed to the curtailment of a single BMP — winter manure application to fields. We field-tested the hypothesis that a change in winter manure applications would impact dissolved and particulate fractions in stream water draining this watershed. We found that the water quality of Graywood Gully is very responsive to winter manure application on environmentally sensitive portions of the sub-watershed. With the short-term resumption of manure application, TP, SRP, TKN, and NO3 concentrations rose dramatically in stream water; elevated phosphorus concentrations persisted over a 5-week period. Total suspended solids, however, were not elevated after short-term manure application. Factors that affected these results were slope of the land, application of manure over snow and during a snowfall, warm air and soil temperatures, and possibly tile drainage of snowmelt water. Managers of agricultural systems must recognize that phosphorus losses from the watershed during the nongrowing season may detrimentally affect nuisance population of algae in lakes during the summer.

AB  - Irrigation projects have been the subject of much bad press coverage because of the sometimes very damaging environmental and social impacts associated with large-scale projects such as dams, declining aid to agriculture and falling rates of economic returns to irrigation since the heyday of the 1970s. Yet irrigation remains one of the most crucial inputs into farming and therefore a potentially important poverty reduction tool for the 21st century. We review some of the evidence surrounding trends in investments in irrigation and the reasons behind the decline. We also provide a framework for analysing the positive and negative impacts of irrigation on poverty, how these might differ by the type of irrigation technology and review some of the evidence of these impacts. We reach a number of conclusions about the conditions under which irrigation is most likely to have a positive impact on the poor, but we also report that the evidence is patchy, and usually not gathered in such a way as to allow easy conclusions to be drawn.

AB  - A representative agricultural area of 150 ha located in a protected ecosystem (Axios River Delta, Thermaikos Gulf—N. Aegean, Greece) was selected in order to investigate water quality parameters [pH, electrical conductivity (ECw), NO3–N, NH4–N, total phosphorus (TP)] in irrigation and drainage water. In the study area, the cultivated crops are mainly rice, maize, cotton, and fodder. Surface irrigation methods are applied using open channels network, and irrigation water is supplied by Axios River, which is facing pollution problems. The return flow from surface runoff and the surplus of irrigation water are collected to drainage network and disposed to Thermaikos Gulf. A 2-year study (2006–2007) was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of land use and irrigation water management on the drainage water quality. The average pH and NO3–N concentration was higher in the irrigation water (8.0 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively) than that in the drainage water (7.6 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively). The average ECW, NH4–N, and TP concentration was higher in the drainage water (1,754 μS/cm, 90.3 μg/L, and 0.2 mg/L, respectively) than that in the irrigation water (477.1 μS/cm, 46.7 μg/L, and 0.1 mg/L, respectively). Average irrigation efficiency was estimated at 47% and 51% in 2006 and 2007 growing seasons (April–October), respectively. The loads of NO3–N in both seasons were higher in the irrigation water (35.1 kg/ha in 2006 and 24.9 kg/ha in 2007) than those in the drainage water (8.1 kg/ha in 2006 and 7.6 kg/ha in 2007). The load of TP was higher in the irrigation water in season 2006 (2.8 kg/ha) than that in the drainage water (1.1 kg/ha). Total phosphorus load in 2007 was equal in irrigation and drainage water (1.2 kg/ha). Wetland conditions, due to rice irrigation regime, drainage network characteristics, and the crop distribution in the study area, affect the drainage water ending in the protected ecosystem of Thermaikos Gulf.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the water–food nexus, especially the restrictive effect of water on food production in hot spots where irrigation stress is growing. However, little is known about the largerscale implications of future irrigation shortfalls for global trade and economic welfare, as well as of the potential buffering impacts of international trade on the local impacts of irrigation shortage. In this paper, we utilize a recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, to study the economic effects of changes in irrigation outlook for 126 river basins, globally by 2030. Projected irrigation availability is obtained from the IMPACT-WATER model, and imposed upon the present-day economy. Irrigation availability in 2030 is expected to drop by 30–60% in several key rivers basins, including: Hai He, Indus, Luni, and the Eastern Mediterranean basin, leading to significant output declines in China, South Asia, and the Middle East. We find that the regional production impacts of future irrigation water shortages are quite heterogeneous, depending on the size of the shortfall, the irrigation intensity of crop production, the possibility of expanding rainfed areas, as well as the crop mix. These changes in regional output significantly alter the geography of international trade. To compensate for the loss of productivity caused by the irrigation constraint, an estimated 7.6 million hectares of cropland expansion is needed to meet the demand for food. In spite of the remarkable reduction of irrigation in some basins, the resulting welfare impact is relatively modest as a result of the buffering capacity of global markets. The global welfare loss amounts to $3.7 billion (2001 prices) and results from a combination of the reduction in irrigation availability as well as the interplay with agricultural support policies.

AB  - A potential hazard to Beijing was revealed due to the accumulation trend of heavy metals in agricultural soils with sewage irrigation, which results in metal contamination and human exposure risk. Samples including soils and plants were collected to assess the impacts of sewage irrigation on the irrigated farming area of Beijing. Concentrations of the five elements Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb were determined in samples to calculate the accumulation factor and to establish a basis for environmental protection and the suitability of sewage irrigation for particular land use in the urban–rural interaction area of Beijing. Using reference values provided by the Beijing Background Research Cooperative Group in the 1970s, the pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), and contamination factor (CF) of these metals were calculated. The pollution load indices (sewage irrigation land 3.49) of soils indicated that metal contamination occurred in these sites. The metal enrichment (EF of Cd 1.8, Cr 1.7, Cu 2.3, Zn 2.0, Pb 1.9) and the metal contamination (CF of Cd 2.6, Cr 1.5, Cu 2.0, Zn 1.7, Pb 1.6) showed that the accumulation trend of the five toxic metals increased during the sewage irrigation as compared with the lower reference values than other region in China and world average, and that pollution with Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb was exacerbated in soils. The distributions of these metals were homogeneous in the irrigation area, but small-scale heterogeneous spatial distribution was observed. Irrigation sources were found to affect heavy metal distributions in soils. It was suggested that heavy metal transfer from soils to plants was a key pathway to human health exposure to metal contamination. However, with the expansion of urban areas in Beijing, soil inhalation and ingestion may become important pathways of human exposure to metal contamination.

T2  - International Journal of Water Resources Development
AB  - Drip irrigation in India has expanded slowly. One reason cited is the high capital costs facing the smallholder-dominated agricultural sector. Governments have provided capital subsidies in response. This study finds that, rather than improving access to drip, the subsidy system holds the technology back, because its technical requirements, highly bureaucratic processes and pricing incentives turn many drip providers into rent-seeking agents rather than service providers to farmers, leading to price increases of 40% or more. If capital costs are truly the constraint on drip expansion in India, alternative models to address them are available.

TI  - Impact of treadle pump irrigation technology on smallholder poverty and food security in Malawi: a case study of Blantyre and Mchinji districts
AU  - Mangisoni, Julius H.
T2  - International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability
AB  - The Malawi Government has intensified the use of treadle pump irrigation technology in an attempt to increase agricultural production and also to enrich the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers. As a result, the treadle pump is gaining in popularity among smallholder farmers throughout the country. This study was conducted in the districts of Blantyre in the Southern Region and Mchinji in the Central Region of Malawi. A total of 50 treadle pump and 50 non-treadle pump farmers were interviewed in each district to assess the impact of treadle pump irrigation technology with regard to food security and poverty. Gross margin analysis showed that adopters of the technology had higher net farm incomes per hectare (NFIs/ha) than non-adopters per year. In Blantyre, NFI/ha value for adopters was MK122,855 (US$1007) compared with MK15,987 (US$131) for non-adopters under irrigation conditions. Similar results were found in Mchinji with MK51,858 (US$425) and MK16,090 (US$132) for adopters and non-adopters, respectively. Likewise, under rain-fed conditions, adopters had higher NFIs/ha than non-adopters: in Blantyre, the respective NFIs were MK19,497 (US$152) and MK3344 (US$27), whereas in Mchinji the respective values were MK16,896 (US$138) and MK10,084 (US$83). Furthermore, the well-being measurements and analyses of poverty revealed a higher poverty level among non-adopters compared with adopters. The former also had a greater relative risk of falling into deeper poverty than the latter. Transition matrices depicting movement in and out of poverty showed that from 2004 to 2005, some poor adopters moved out of poverty while some non-adopters dropped from being non-poor to poor. No adopter moved from non-poor to poor. From the results, it is concluded that the Government of Malawi should be urged to increase the availability of this kind of technology to the market at a reduced cost by offering tax incentives to local manufacturers and by using an input voucher system to subsidize qualified poor smallholder farmers.

TI  - Micro-Level Decision for Area Shift in Favour of High-Value Crops: A Case of Horticultural Crops
AU  - Mehta, Pradeep Kumar
AU  - Mehta, Pradeep Kumar
AB  - Area shift towards horticultural crops is vital for increasing farm income, productivity and overall employment in the agricultural sector. Several economic (price and income) and non-economic (food-security concerns) factors influence farmers’ decisions at the farm level. This paper has examined the role of both price and income, along with the role of food-security goals, in the decision-making of farmers regarding shift from low-value crops (food crops) to high-value commercial crops (horticultural crops). It has been shown that higher food requirements at home inhibit the extent of crop-substitution decision of the farmers. However, farmers are less responsive to the changes in the prices of food grains (in terms of changing their consumption) as higher income from high-value crops provide adequate money to purchase food crops from the market. Relative income (not the relative price) of the crops has been found to explain the crop-substitution decisions of the farmers. The farmers have been reported to calculate the aggregate gain from the crop rather calculating only the price of the crop, while making the decision to shift. Their capacity to generate higher productivity along with better market prospects have been recorded to explain farmers’ decision to shift area.

AB  - Although irrigation systems have long been evaluated andmanaged as though they existed only to produce irrigatedcrops, in fact many irrigation systems also provide water forother uses, especially in much of Asia. The quantities ofwater used in these activities may be small, but these useshave high value in terms of household income, nutrition, andhealth. Recognizing the multiple uses of water in irrigationsystems is critical for better water allocation policy. First,the value of water in irrigation systems has been undervaluedbecause of a failure to recognize the many uses. A moreaccurate assessment that includes all uses will better informdecisions about allocating water (and financial resources)between irrigation and other uses. Second, even withinirrigation systems, taking all uses into account can lead tomore productive and environmentally sustainable use of water.Third, recognizing the rights of all users of water can leadto more equitable and socially sustainable outcomes ofmanagement, rehabilitation, and any proposed reallocation ofwater resources. Recognizing all uses of water makes watermanagement and economic and institutional analyses morecomplex. Because many of the interactions between uses areaffected by water quality at least as much as quantity, italso brings environmental and health issues to the fore. Thisarticle reviews these issues, drawing upon the case studyarticles from Sri Lanka and India, which are presented in thisspecial issue.

AU  - Moore, Madison
AU  - Moore, Madison
AB  - By 2025, water withdrawals are expected to increase by 50% in developing countries and 18% in developed countries. By 2050, 2.7 billion people will need to draw from our current source of freshwater; irrigated agriculture currently accounts for 40% of all food production. With the demand for irrigation water rapidly increasing and supply being finite, issues related to conservation, allocation and policy are becoming more and more important. This investigation is aimed at analyzing production behavior through a study of average farm revenue and several input demand variables. It is found that farmers seek to maximize profit through increased water application rates as well as production of high -valued, water -intensive crops. Through an understanding of what drives production behavior, policy makers can increase their understanding of irrigation water importance as well as properly control its usage. Furthermore, by investigating water consumption in the largest water using sector (agricultural production), the world can come to a better understanding of the importance of irrigation in the agricultural industry as well as the impact of decreases in water availability on food production.

AB  - Background
Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have investigated the ecology and behaviour of malaria vectors and Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission on the coast of Kenya. Substantial progress has been made to control vector populations and reduce high malaria prevalence and severe disease. The goal of this paper was to examine trends over the past 20 years in Anopheles species composition, density, blood-feeding behaviour, and P. falciparum sporozoite transmission along the coast of Kenya.

Methods
Using data collected from 1990 to 2010, vector density, species composition, blood-feeding patterns, and malaria transmission intensity was examined along the Kenyan coast. Mosquitoes were identified to species, based on morphological characteristics and DNA extracted from Anopheles gambiae for amplification. Using negative binomial generalized estimating equations, mosquito abundance over the period were modelled while adjusting for season. A multiple logistic regression model was used to analyse the sporozoite rates.

Results
Results show that in some areas along the Kenyan coast, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles merus have replaced An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles funestus as the major mosquito species. Further, there has been a shift from human to animal feeding for both An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) (99% to 16%) and An. funestus (100% to 3%), and P. falciparum sporozoite rates have significantly declined over the last 20 years, with the lowest sporozoite rates being observed in 2007 (0.19%) and 2008 (0.34%). There has been, on average, a significant reduction in the abundance of An. gambiae s.l. over the years (IRR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.90–0.98), with the density standing at low levels of an average 0.006 mosquitoes/house in the year 2010.

Conclusion
Reductions in the densities of the major malaria vectors and a shift from human to animal feeding have contributed to the decreased burden of malaria along the Kenyan coast. Vector species composition remains heterogeneous but in many areas An. arabiensis has replaced An. gambiae as the major malaria vector. This has important implications for malaria epidemiology and control given that this vector predominately rests and feeds on humans outdoors. Strategies for vector control need to continue focusing on tools for protecting residents inside houses but additionally employ outdoor control tools because these are essential for further reducing the levels of malaria transmission.

T2  - World Development
AB  - Pakistan, home of the world’s most extensive irrigation system, has followed a global trend in irrigation to devolve management from government to farmers and farmer organizations. We implement the most extensive survey of irrigation management ever conducted in Pakistan to examine variation in farmer participation in managing local irrigation systems under the new governance regime. Building on and adding to previous work in Pakistan and elsewhere, we examine the effects of privately accessed groundwater, groundwater quality, surface water, and other factors along 5 different community management responsibilities, including roles that existed prior to decentralization (maintenance of the watercourse and dispute resolution) and new roles that were created after (voting to elect representative at the higher level, collection of water charges, and holding internal meetings). Each responsibility represents a collection action problem for the community. We find that while group leader education is important in successful execution of the roles, voting has in general been taken up enthusiastically while water charge collection remains, not surprisingly, low. We find a previously unreported inverse-U shaped relationship between groundwater availability and farmer participation, and that availability of high groundwater quality (less-saline) groundwater significantly reduces participation, as does high variation in canal water supply within a growing season. We also find, contrary to expectation, that communities in the tail reaches of the system, known to receive worse canal water service, more actively participate in managing their local irrigation systems. The findings have important implications for the continued push for decentralized surface irrigation management in South Asia and elsewhere as groundwater irrigation continues to expand and equitable access to surface water remains a policy concern.

TI  - Does groundwater irrigation reduce rural poverty? Evidence from Indian states
AU  - Narayanamoorthy, A.
T2  - Irrigation and Drainage
AB  - Groundwater irrigation has become a dominant source of irrigation in Indian agriculture today. Besides increasing the cropping intensity and productivity of crops, the intensive cultivation of crops due to timely access to groundwater irrigation increases the demand for agricultural labourers and hence wage rates for those who mostly live below the poverty line. Both increased affordability of foodgrain and wage rates help the rural poor to cross the poverty barriers. However, the importance of groundwater has not been recognized by studies focusing on rural poverty in India. Since groundwater irrigation is proved to be prominent in increasing the production of crops, it is likely that the impact of it on rural poverty would also be significant. In this study, therefore, an attempt has been made to examine the nexus between groundwater irrigation and rural poverty using state-wise cross-section data covering five time points: 1973–74, 1977–78, 1983, 1987–88 and 1993–94. The study shows that there is a significant inverse relationship between the availability of groundwater irrigation and the percentage of rural poverty at all five time points. The results suggest that public policy should focus more on developing groundwater irrigation, without harming the environment, through a strong rural electrification and institutional credit support wherever possible to reduce rural poverty in a sustained manner.

T2  - Ecological Engineering
AB  - This paper reviews research on the ecosystem services or multifunctionality of paddy rice cultivation in Japan, focusing on biodiversity as a basis for ecosystem services, with the aim of describing the current status and impact of the subject and exploring options for sustainable practices. Ecosystem services provided by paddy fields include; groundwater recharge, production of non-rice foods, flood control, soil erosion and landslide prevention, climate-change mitigation, water purification, culture and landscape, and support of ecosystems and biodiversity. Among these services, the value of services that regulate ecosystem functions was estimated to be US$ 72.8 billion in Japan. More than 5000 species have been recorded in paddy fields and the surrounding environment. Because paddy fields are artificially disturbed by water level management, plowing, and harvest, most species move between paddy fields and the surrounding environment. The linkage between paddy fields and the associated environment plays an important role in biodiversity. Two changes that have affected the ecosystem of paddy fields are modernization and abandonment of farming. Satoyama, a traditional socio-ecological production landscape, which provided a functional linkage between paddy fields and the associated environment has lost its functions. Biodiversity-conscious rice farming has been promoted by collaborations among farmers, consumers and governments. Biodiversity certification programs are successful examples of biodiversity-conscious framing. In these programs incentives include direct payments and/or premium prices paid by consumers, as well as farmers willingness to improve the safety of food and environment.

TI  - Climate change: Impact on agriculture and costs of adaptation
AU  - Research Institute (Ifpri), International Food Policy
AB  - Abstract: The Challenge: The unimpeded growth of greenhouse gas emissions is raising the earth's temperature. The consequences include melting glaciers, more precipitation, more and more extreme weather events, and shifting seasons. The accelerating pace of climate change, combined with global population and income growth, threatens food security everywhere. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures eventually reduce yields of desirable crops while encouraging weed and pest proliferation. Changes in precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of short-run crop failures and long-run production declines. Although there will be gains in some crops in some regions of the world, the overall impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to be negative, threatening global food security. Populations in the developing world, which are already vulnerable and food insecure, are likely to be the most seriously affected. In 2005, nearly half of the economically active population in developing countries-2.5 billion people- relied on agriculture for its livelihood. Today, 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas. This Food Policy Report presents research results that quantify the climate-change impacts mentioned above, assesses the consequences for food security, and estimates the investments that would offset the negative consequences for human well-being. This analysis brings together, for the first time, detailed modeling of crop growth under climate change with insights from an extremely detailed global agriculture model, using two climate scenarios to simulate future climate.

AB  - This report assesses the cost of adaptation to climate change across a range of future climate scenarios and investment options. We focus on offsetting climate change impacts on hunger through investment in agricultural research, water management, and rural infrastructure in developing countries. We link climate, crop, water, and economic models to (1) analyze scenarios of future change in the agriculture sector to 2050 and (2) assess trade-offs for these investments across key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for poverty, hunger, and water. Our reference projections show that climate change slows progress toward eliminating hunger, with an additional 78 million people facing chronic hunger in 2050 relative to a no-climate-change future, over half of them in Africa south of the Sahara. Increased investments can offset these impacts. Achieving this would require that annual investment in international agricultural research increase from US$1.62 billion to US$2.77 billion per year between 2015 and 2050. Additional water and infrastructure investments are estimated to be more expensive than agricultural R&D at about US$12.7 billion and US$10.8 billion per year, respectively, but these address key gaps to support transformation toward food system resiliency. Findings on ranges of costs and trade-offs and complementarities across SDGs will help policymakers make better-informed choices between alternative investment strategies.

AB  - This article argues that the Green Revolution in Pakistan has failed to live up to its promise of ending hunger, unemployment and poverty. An analysis of the time series data of the past four decades points to the worsening of inequalities in income and asset distribution, contributing to the poverty of one in every three Pakistanis [World Bank, 2002, 1992]. The article measures the distributional impact of the Green Revolution in three allied areas of tenurial security, rural employment and rural household income, which tended to decline correspondingly, worsening income and asset distribution. Based on this evidence, this article makes a case for equitable land distribution in rural Pakistan, where half of the population is landless [World Bank, 2002].

T2  - Water Policy
AB  - This paper explores the dynamic interface of state-water users' relationships in large-scale surface irrigation in India and China, to inquire to what extent the issues encountered in large-scale irrigation management and governance are independent of regime characteristics. Though operating in very different overall political regimes, China and India exhibit strong similarities in the way a central state has attempted to relate with local water users, in the types of policy instruments deployed to shape that relationship, and in the problems encountered. Both China and India have a long history of state involvement in irrigation management. Both saw massive expansion after the late 1940s. The state then tried to extend its control in response to ‘underutilisation’ of the created infrastructure, revenue shortfalls and perceived inefficiencies and yield gaps. In recent decades the policy approaches have, at least rhetorically, emphasised water users' self-management and governance, including financial self-management/cost recovery. In both countries the instrument for this has been Water User Associations. Results have been mixed, to say the least, on all counts. Larger institutional and policy characteristics adhering to the problematic of the state-user interface subvert stated reform objectives.

AB  - Long-term trends of crop yields have been used as a means to evaluate the sustainability of intensive agriculture. Previous studies have measured yield trends from long-term rice–rice and rice–wheat experiments in different sites from the slopes of individual site regressions of yield over time. The statistical significance of each site regression was determined but not that of the aggregate trend, which could give an indication of the magnitude and significance of global yield change.

The random regression coefficient analysis (RRCA) and meta-analysis were used in this study to analyze the aggregate yield trend from several long-term experiments (LTE) across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and outside the IGP. Both methods show that there has been a significant (p < 0.05) declining trend in rice yield in rice–wheat LTEs in South Asia including China with the recommended rates of nutrients, but that there has been no significant change in wheat and system (rice + wheat) yields. There was no significant year × region (IGP versus non-IGP) interaction in rice and wheat yields. However, RRCA showed that the average yield trend was significantly negative (−41.0 kg ha−1 yr−1) only in the IGP. In the rice–rice LTEs, there was a significant year × site (IRRI versus non-IRRI sites) interaction during the dry season but not the wet season. Rice yields declined throughout Asia in the wet season. The average system (dry + wet season rice) yield trends were significantly negative in both IRRI and non-IRRI sites (−170.1 and −52.8 kg ha−1 yr−1, respectively) but the magnitude of yield decline was significantly greater in the IRRI sites than in the non-IRRI sites.

Rice in the rice–wheat LTEs showed a significantly positive yield trend with the addition of farmyard manure (FYM) but the initial yield was generally lower with FYM than without FYM. After 15 years, yield increase due to FYM was not evident in most of the LTE.

T2  - The FASEB Journal
AB  - Interventions aimed at increasing water availability for agricultural activities hold great potential for improving nutrition by increasing food production, income, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions, and women's empowerment. There is scarce evidence on the linkages between small-scale irrigation and the pathways through which nutrition outcomes can be achieved. Using data from a cross-sectional household survey collected between 2014 and 2015 from 439 and 451 households in Ethiopia and Tanzania respectively, we explore the potential for small-scale irrigation to contribute to improved diets as well as identify the pathways through which irrigation affects nutrition. We analyze data with an instrumental variable approach to estimate a simultaneous system of three equations, examining the relationships between irrigation and production diversity, household income and household dietary diversity. Results show that access to irrigation leads to improved household diet quality, as measured by the Household Dietary Diversity Score, mainly through the pathway of increasing household incomes. Irrigation is also found to increase production diversity, but we find no evidence that production diversity leads to increased dietary diversity. Our results are consistent with other studies that show how production diversity may be inversely associated with dietary diversity, potentially due to forgone productivity and profits associated with crop specialization.

AB  - There is a gradual decline in availability of fresh water to be used for irrigation in India. As a consequence, the use of sewage and other industrial effluents for irrigating agricultural lands is on the rise particularly in peri-urban areas of developing countries. On the other hand, there is increasing concern regarding the exceedance of statutory and advisory food standards for trace metals throughout the world. Hence, a case study was undertaken to assess the long-term effect of sewage irrigation on heavy metal content in soils, plants and groundwater. For this purpose, peri-urban agricultural lands under Keshopur Effluent Irrigation Scheme (KEIS) of Delhi, India were selected where various cereals, millets, vegetable and fodder crops have successfully been grown. Sewage effluents, ground water, soil and plant samples were collected and analysed mainly for metal contents. Results indicated that sewage effluents contained much higher amount of P, K, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni compared to groundwater. While, there was no significant variation in Pb and Cd concentrations in these two sources of irrigation water and metal content were within the permissible limits for its use as irrigation water. There was an increase in organic carbon content ranging from 38 to 79% in sewage-irrigated soils as compared to tubewell water-irrigated ones. On an average, the soil pH dropped by 0.4 unit as a result of sewage irrigation. Sewage irrigation for 20 years resulted into significant build-up of DTPA-extractable Zn (208%), Cu (170%), Fe (170%), Ni (63%) and Pb (29%) in sewage-irrigated soils over adjacent tubewell water-irrigated soils, whereas Mn was depleted by 31%. Soils receiving sewage irrigation for 10 years exhibited significant increase in Zn, Fe, Ni and Pb, while only Fe in soils was positively affected by sewage irrigation for 5 years. Among these metals, only Zn in some samples exceeded the phytotoxicity limit. Fractionation study indicated relatively higher build-up of Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn in bioavailable pools of sewage-irrigated soils. By and large, tissue metal concentrations in all the crops were below the generalized critical levels of phytotoxicity. Based on the soil to plant transfer ratio (transfer factor) of metals, relative efficiency of some cereals, millet and vegetable crops to absorb metals from sewage and tubewell water-irrigated soils was worked out. Risk assessment in respect of metal contents in some vegetable crops grown on these sewage-irrigated soils indicated that these vegetables can be consumed safely by human.

TI  - World salinization with emphasis on Australia
AU  - Rengasamy, Pichu
T2  - Journal of Experimental Botany
AB  - Salinization is the accumulation of water-soluble salts in the soil solum or regolith to a level that impacts on agricultural production, environmental health, and economic welfare. Salt-affected soils occur in more than 100 countries of the world with a variety of extents, nature, and properties. No climatic zone in the world is free from salinization, although the general perception is focused on arid and semi-arid regions. Salinization is a complex process involving the movement of salts and water in soils during seasonal cycles and interactions with groundwater. While rainfall, aeolian deposits, mineral weathering, and stored salts are the sources of salts, surface and groundwaters can redistribute the accumulated salts and may also provide additional sources. Sodium salts dominate in many saline soils of the world, but salts of other cations such as calcium, magnesium, and iron are also found in specific locations. Different types of salinization with a prevalence of sodium salts affect about 30% of the land area in Australia. While more attention is given to groundwater-associated salinity and irrigation salinity, which affects about 16% of the agricultural area, recent investigations suggest that 67% of the agricultural area has a potential for ‘transient salinity’, a type of nongroundwater-associated salinity. Agricultural soils in Australia, being predominantly sodic, accumulate salts under seasonal fluctuations and have multiple subsoil constraints such as alkalinity, acidity, sodicity, and toxic ions. This paper examines soil processes that dictate the exact edaphic environment upon which root functions depend and can help in research on plant improvement.

AB  - Corruption can determine the allocation of water in a large, public, canal-irrigation system. The socio-economic characteristics of farmers who participate in illegal exchanges are analyzed using hydraulic and socio-economic field data collected in 420 canal outlets of a southern Punjab irrigation system in Pakistan. A theoretical framework for analyzing a farmers’ decision to engage into corrupt transactions is proposed and validated through econometric analysis. The analysis shows that corruption does not only involve economically and politically powerful farmers, but that it also concerns the lower social segments of rural society.

T2  - Geophysical Research Letters
AB  - The Indian subcontinent is one of the most intensely irrigated regions of the world and state of the art climate models do not account for the representation of irrigation. Sensitivity studies with the regional climate model REMO show distinct feedbacks between the simulation of the monsoon circulation with and without irrigation processes. We find that the temperature and mean sea level pressure, where the standard REMO version without irrigation shows a significant bias over the areas of Indus basin, is highly sensitive to the water used for irrigation. In our sensitivity test we find that removal of this bias has caused less differential heating between land and sea masses. This in turns reduces the westerlies entering into land from Arabian Sea, hence creating conditions favorable for currents from Bay of Bengal to intrude deep into western India and Pakistan that have been unrealistically suppressed before. We conclude that the representation of irrigated water is unavoidable for realistic simulation of south Asian summer monsoon and its response under global warming.

AU  - Scheierling, Susanne

T2  - Water Economics and Policy
AB  - Expectations are that the agricultural sector will have to expand the use of water for irrigation to meet rising food demand, while at the same time the competition for water resources is growing in many regions. Increasing water productivity in agriculture is widely seen as a critical response to help address this challenge. Yet much of the public debate is vague on the meaning of agricultural water productivity — often emphasizing “more crop per drop” as if water were the only input that mattered —, and approaches for assessing and increasing water productivity are seldom addressed systematically. This paper discusses conceptual issues that should be kept in mind when assessing agricultural water productivity, and presents findings from what may be the first survey of the agricultural productivity and efficiency literature with regard to the explicit inclusion of water aspects in productivity and efficiency measurements. The survey comprises studies applying single-factor productivity (SFP) measures, total factor productivity (TFP) indices and frontier models. Studies using deductive methods are also included. A key finding is that the studies tend to either incorporate field- and basin-level aspects but focus only on a single input (water), or they apply multi-factor approaches but do not tackle the basin-level aspects. It seems that no study has yet presented an approach that accounts for multiple inputs and basin-level issues. Deductive methods may provide the flexibility to overcome some of the limitations of the other methods.

AB  - Home-based vegetable production has been recognized as a nutrition- and gender-sensitive intervention that has the potential to improve nutrition in developing countries, yet evidence is lacking. This study tested whether women’s training in improved home gardens (including nutrition as well as technical aspects) contributes to increased production and consumption of vegetables, which are necessary preconditions for improving nutrition. The study used data from 582 poor rural women in two districts of Bangladesh (479 control and 103 intervention). Training increased the per capita production of mostly leafy vegetables from 20 to 37 kg per year (+86 %). Diversity of production and frequency of harvesting also increased. In terms of nutrient yields, the improved gardens increased the supply of plant proteins by 171 %, iron by 284 %, vitamin A by 189 % and vitamin C by 290 %. Training had a significant impact on the diversity of vegetables consumed, based on 30-day food frequency data and also increased the relative involvement of women in the home garden for all gardening tasks. These results indicate that women’s home gardens are an effective intervention in Bangladesh for increasing the supply and consumption of a diverse range of vegetables in poor rural households, thereby contributing to nutrition security.

AU  - Senanayake, Nari

T2  - Agricultural Water Management
AB  - There is a rich body of literature on arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater and its consequences for human health via drinking water. Less is known however, on the impacts that flow from the use of arsenic rich groundwater for irrigation or the effectiveness of arsenic remediation in agricultural systems. To partially fill this gap, we review 29 studies that examine the consequences of irrigating with arsenic contaminated groundwater and 28 studies which evaluate interventions aimed at reducing its negative impacts on human health and crops. These studies are geographically limited to West Bengal and Bangladesh (Bengal plains) as these regions constitute hubs of concerns for groundwater contamination. These studies show that there are six broad categories of interventions: deficit irrigation; soil fertilization; growing alternative field crops (other than paddy); switching to arsenic tolerant paddy cultivars; cooking methods to reduce arsenic content in rice and nutritional supplements. Importantly, these efforts target different stages of the agri-food system, some intervene in production processes and balance concerns for crop yields and human health while others focus on consumption practices and only mitigate health risks. Despite this diversity in focus, our results indicate that all treatments have positive effects, either in reducing As content in grains, its accumulation in soil and/or increase crop yields compared to control groups. However, the extent of these impacts varies as do their implications for long-term agricultural sustainability. From a policy perspective, these interventions offer promising alternatives to the extremes of restricted groundwater use on the one hand, and unregulated extraction on the other, but are yet to be integrated into mainstream extension services.

AB  - Irrigation Management Transfer and Participatory Irrigation Management (IMT/PIM) remain popular policies with national governments and international funding institutions. However, despite their widespread application as remedies for poor irrigation system performance, the actual effectiveness of transfer programs is still the subject of much debate and contestation. Our study enters these debates on IMT/PIM through a Systematic Review of all available impact assessments of IMT/PIM in Asia, Africa and Latin America published since 1994. In total we reviewed 131 citations, which together provided 230 case studies of 181 separate IMT/PIM interventions. We found the strength of the methods used to infer impact was low or very low in almost all cases. As important, we found that the distribution of studies was unrepresentative, the data analyzed less than ideal, and the specific criteria for determining success frequently unclear. This leads us to question any overall conclusions based on existing impact evaluations. Our overall conclusion is that research to inform future IMT/PIM policy needs to design better assessments of IMT/PIM performance but that this body of literature must also be supplemented by studies that provide insights into IMT/PIM policy practice.

AU  - Shah, Tushaar
AB  - "In 1947, British India - the part of South Asia that is today's India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh - emerged from the colonial era with the world's largest centrally managed canal irrigation infrastructure. However, as vividly illustrated by Tushaar Shah, the orderly irrigation economy that saved millions of rural poor from droughts and famines is now a vast atomistic system of widely dispersed tube-wells that are drawing groundwater without permits or hindrances. Taming the Anarchy is about the development of this chaos and the prospects to bring it under control. It is about both the massive benefit that the irrigation economy has created and the ill-fare it threatens through depleted aquifers and pollution." "Taming the Anarchy provides a fascinating economic, political, and cultural history of the development and use of technology that is also a history of a society in transition. The book offers powerful ideas and lessons for researchers, economists, historians, and policymakers interested in South Asia, as well as readers who are interested in the water and agricultural futures of other developing countries and regions, including China and Africa."--P. 4 of cover

AU  - Shiva, Vandana
AB  - As the agricultural systems of many countries are poised, as a result of the recent advances in biotechnology for what may soon come to be called the Second Green Revolution, this book is particularly appropriate. Vandana Shiva examines the impact of the first Green Revolution on the breadbasket of India. In a cogent empirical argument, she shows how the 'quick fix' promise of large gains in output pushed aside serious pursuit of an alternative agricultural strategy grounded in respect for the environmental wisdom of peasant systems and building an egalitarian, needs-prientated agriculture consistent with the village-based, endogenous political traditions of Gandhism. Dr Shiva documents the destruction of genetic diversity and soil fertility that resulted and in highly original fashion shows how the Green Revolution also contributed to the acute social and political conflicts now tearing the Punjab apart.

Set in the context of a sophisticated critique of the privileged epistemological position achieved by modern science, whereby it both aspires to provide technological solutions for social and political problems while at the same time disclaiming responsibility for the new problems which it creates in its wake, the author looks to the future in an analysis of a new project to apply the latest Gene Revolution technology to India and warns of the further environmental and social damage which will ensue.

T2  - Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences
AB  - The analysis undertaken in this paper applies a multimarket model to simulate two policy measures based on the assumption that the government of Sudan would pursue two policies on the Gezira scheme the biggest irrigated scheme in Africa in attempts to achieve food self-sufficiency from wheat (major food crop), or to improve the foreign exchange earnings from cotton (major cash crop) through expanding their portions of cultivated land. The paper investigates the implications of each scenario on crops output, food self-sufficiency indicators and tenants’ welfare. Findings show that, the food security scenario raises self-sufficiency from wheat by 40% and reduces it for sorghum by 4%. However, it reduces the welfare level as the earnings from exports and revenues from tariffs decline. The foreign earning scenario on the other hand, improves the overall foreign earnings and enhances farmers’ welfare. Nonetheless, the study suggests that none of the two policies would achieve both objectives alone, hence it is recommended that, both policies are to be considered in a policy package that considers as well other related components.

AB  - Prolonged consumption of rice containing elevated cadmium (Cd) levels is a significant health issue particularly in subsistence communities that are dependent on rice produced on-farm. This situation is further exacerbated in areas of known non-ferrous mineralization adjacent to rice-based agricultural systems where the opportunity for contamination of rice and its eventual entry into the food chain is high. In the current study, an assessment of the degree of soil Cd and Zn contamination and associated rice grain Cd contamination downstream of an actively mined zone of Zn mineralization in western Thailand was undertaken. Total soil Cd and Zn concentrations in the rice-based agricultural system investigated ranged from 0.5 to 284 mg kg(-1) and 100 to 8036 mg kg(-1), respectively. Further, the results indicate that the contamination is associated with suspended sediment transported to fields via the irrigation supply. Consequently, the spatial distribution of Cd and Zn is directly related to a field's proximity to primary outlets from in-field irrigation channels and inter-field irrigation flows with 60-100% of the Cd and Zn loading associated with the first three fields in irrigation sequence. Rice grain Cd concentrations in the 524 fields sampled, ranged from 0.05 to 7.7 mg kg(-1). Over 90% of the rice grain samples collected contained Cd at concentrations exceeding the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) draft Maximum Permissible Level for rice grain of 0.2 mg Cd kg(-1). In addition, as a function of demographic group, estimated Weekly Intake (WI) values ranged from 20 to 82 mug Cd per kg Body. This poses a significant public health risk to local communities. The results of this study suggest that an irrigation sequence-based field classification technique in combination with strategic soil and rice grain sampling and the estimation of WI values via rice intake alone may be a useful decision support tool to rapidly evaluate potential public health risks in irrigated rice-based agricultural systems receiving Cd contaminated irrigation water. In addition, the proposed technique will facilitate the cost effective strategic targeting of detailed epidemiological studies thus focusing resources to specific 'high risk' areas.

TI  - Assessment of the contribution of irrigation to poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods
AU  - Smith, Laurence E. D.
T2  - International Journal of Water Resources Development
AB  - Irrigation in developing countries tends to be stereotyped as equity reducing, in competition with other uses for scarce water resources, and often resulting in negative impacts for women and other disadvantaged groups. Agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for poverty reduction is examined. There are four inter‐related mechanisms through which irrigated agriculture can reduce poverty. These are: improvements in the levels and security of productivity, employment and incomes for irrigating farm households and farm labour; the linkage and multiplier effects of agricultural intensification for the wider economy; provision of opportunities for diversification of rural livelihoods; and multiple uses of irrigation supply. There are also significant risks that badly designed and managed irrigation can negatively impact on poverty. It is concluded that irrigated farming varies widely in its form and impacts, and has diverse local attributes. Water resource management decisions must recognize this and be based on an holistic and livelihood‐centred assessment of irrigation benefits and costs that goes beyond food production objectives.

AB  - This paper describes and assesses the current status of livestock production systems, the drivers of global livestock production, and the major trends in such production. The analysis covers the six major livestock species: cattle and buffaloes, goats and sheep, pigs and chickens. Global drivers of the livestock sector include economic growth and income, demographic and land use changes, dietary adjustments and technological change. The rate of change and direction of livestock development vary greatly among world regions, with Asia showing the most rapid growth and structural change. The paper also examines system dynamics, by analysing the ways livestock production has adjusted to external forces. A brief discussion of how these trends link to food safety concludes the paper.

AB  - Poor performance of government-managed irrigation systems persists in developing countries despite numerous policy interventions over the last four decades. We argue that many of these interventions have failed, because they did not recognize irrigation bureaucracies as prime actors in policy change. This paper examines the varied actors and agendas within irrigation bureaucracies, highlighting the dichotomy between “hydraulic missions” on the one hand and direct service provision to farmers on the other. To increase the significance of future reform, bureaucracies must be considered as explicit actors, and reform efforts should derive from better understanding of the farmer–agency interface.

T2  - Irrigation and Drainage Systems
AB  - Ethiopia’s irrigation potential is estimated at 3.7 million hectare, of which only about 190,000 ha (4.3% of the potential) is actually irrigated. There is little information on the extent to which the so far developed irrigation schemes have been effective in meeting their stated objectives of attaining food self-sufficiency and eradicating poverty. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security based on data obtained from 200 farmers in Ada Liben district of Ethiopia in 2006. The resulting data was analyzed using Heckman’s Two-step Estimation procedure. Studies elsewhere revealed that access to reliable irrigation water can enable farmers to adopt new technologies and intensify cultivation, leading to increased productivity, overall higher production, and greater returns from farming. Our study findings confirm some of these claims. In the study area about 70% of the irrigation users are food secure while only 20% of the non-users are found to be food secure. Access to small scale irrigation enabled the sample households to grow crops more than once a year; to insure increased and stable production, income and consumption; and improve their food security status. The study concludes that small-scale irrigation significantly contributed to household food security.

AB  - Abstract
            Strengthening the abilities of smallholder farmers in developing countries, particularly women farmers, to produce for both home and the market is currently a development priority. In many contexts, ownership of assets is strongly gendered, reflecting existing gender norms and limiting women’s ability to invest in more profitable livelihood strategies such as market-oriented agriculture. Yet the intersection between women’s asset endowments and their ability to participate in and benefit from agricultural interventions receives minimal attention. This paper explores changes in gender relations and women’s assets in four agricultural interventions that promoted high value agriculture with different degrees of market-orientation. Findings suggest that these dairy and horticulture projects can successfully involve women and increase production, income and the stock of household assets. In some cases, women were able to increase their control over production, income and assets; however in most cases men’s incomes increased more than women’s and the gender-asset gap did not decrease. Gender- and asset-based barriers to participation in projects as well as gender norms that limit women’s ability to accumulate and retain control over assets both contributed to the results. Comparing experiences across the four projects, especially where projects implemented adaptive measures to encourage gender-equitable outcomes, provides lessons for gender-responsive projects targeting existing and emerging value chains for high value products. Other targeted support to women farmers may also be needed to promote their acquisition of the physical assets required to expand production or enter other nodes of the value chain.

AB  - In an overview of the evolving debates on gender and irrigation in the past two decades, this paper argues that the success of today's policy attention on a blanket policy on gender and irrigation is at the same time its weakness. Two key variations need to be specified for any gender policy to become sufficiently specific to have any teeth. First, gender issues critically differ in female/dual farming systems and male farming systems. Second, water for productive and domestic uses need to be recognized and developed in an integrated way, for both men and women. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Empty pockets, empty ponds? Disadoption of water harvesting technologies in Ethiopia
AU  - Wakeyo, Mekonnen B.
AU  - Gardebroek, Cornelis
T2  - Journal of Arid Environments
AB  - This study analyses disadoption of water harvesting technologies in Ethiopia where the average disadoption rate in the sample areas is as high as 42%. Given that Ethiopia is a drought-prone country with 95% of its crop production being rain-fed, such a high disadoption rate for irrigation technologies is surprising and urges investigation. Using panel data on 332 Ethiopian farm households collected in 2005 and 2010 we estimate a logit model to identify factors underlying disadoption. We find farm-household, economic, technology-specific, and natural condition variables that relate to disadoption. Mainly, shortage of plastic-sheets, altitude, and distance to market increase disadoption whereas education, experience with water harvesting (learning-by-doing), farm profit, availability of family labour, access to credit, ease of selling output, growing perennial crops, and distance from natural water sources decrease the probability of disadoption. There is no evidence that malaria has a significant effect on disadoption. Based on these findings, improved supply of plastic sheets and motor pumps, and advise to farmers on appropriate crops, credit and improved market accesses could contribute to decreasing disadoption of water harvesting technologies.

AB  - The overall goal of our article is to better understand which matters for water savings, farmer income and poverty in China's irrigation systems: incentives to managers or participation of farmers. To pursue this goal, the article has three objectives. First, we track the evolution of water management reform, examining the practice of providing incentives to managers, and increasing the participation of farmers. Second, we identify the impact of water management reform on crop water use. Specifically, we want to measure whether or not incentives to managers and farmer participation in water management institutions affect the performance of the irrigation system. Because we also are interested in the potential results of water management reform, the article explores how changes in incentives and farmer participation affect farmer income and poverty. Based on a random sample of 51 villages and 189 farmers in four large irrigation districts in Ningxia and Henan provinces, both in China's Yellow River Basin, our results show that the two major forms of water management reform, water users' associations (WUAs) and contracting, have begun to systematically replace traditional forms of collective management. Our analysis demonstrates, however, that it is not the nominal implementation of the reform that matters, but rather it is the creation of new management institutions that offer water managers monetary incentives that lead to water savings. In contrast to the original design of China's reform policies, participation of farmers has not played a role in saving water. Importantly, given China's concerns about national food production and poverty alleviation, the reductions in water, at least in our sample sites, do not lead to reductions in income and do not increase the incidence of poverty.

AB  - A joint venture was made by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Society of Facilitators and Trainers Pakistan to train rural women of eight districts of Pakistan in kitchen gardening and off-season vegetable cultivation using a farmer field school (FFS) approach. Overall, 42 females were trained as master trainers who in turn established 48 season-long FFS where 1227 rural females were facilitated to establish home gardens and field plots with emphasis on minimizing chemical inputs in crop production and protection. Observatory skills regarding regular plant growth and ecology were enhanced through agroecosystem analysis, which, in turn, improved their crop management decisions. The largest portion of FFS participants (38.2%) was illiterate and with regard to age, the largest category (36.6%) was 21–30 years old. The participatory FFS activities not only enhanced the awareness of participating rural women folk but also provided a forum to share their experiences. They gained confidence and improved their social interactions and awareness about their role in improving livelihoods and agriculture. The cost–benefit analysis showed home gardens and field plots of vegetables to be economically beneficial activities.

AB  - The development of irrigation schemes by dam construction has led to an increased risk of malaria in Tigray, Ethiopia. We carried out a pilot study near a microdam to assess whether environmental management could reduce malaria transmission by Anopheles arabiensis, the main vector in Ethiopia. The study took place in Deba village, close to a dam; Maisheru village, situated 3–4 km away from the dam, acted as a control. Baseline entomological and clinical data were collected in both villages during the first 12 months. Source reduction, involving filling, draining and shading of potential mosquito-breeding habitats was carried out by the community of Deba in the second year and routine surveillance continued in both villages during the second year. Anopheles arabiensis was highly anthropophilic (Human Blood Index = 0.73), biting early in the night before people went to bed. The major breeding habitats associated with the dam were areas of seepage at the dam base (28%), leaking irrigation canals (16%), pools that formed along the bed of streams from the dam (13%), and man-made pools (12%). In the pre-intervention year, 5.9–7.2 times more adult vectors were found in the dam village compared with the control village. There was a 3.1% higher prevalence of an enlarged spleen in children under 10 years in the dam village than in the control village during the pre-intervention period, but no statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of falciparum malaria between the two villages during the same period. Source reduction was associated with a 49% (95% CI = 46.6–50.0) relative reduction in An. arabiensis adults in the dam village compared with the pre-intervention period. There were very few cases of malaria during the intervention period in both villages making it impossible to judge whether malaria incidence had been reduced. These preliminary findings suggest that in areas of low intensity transmission community-led larval control may be a cheap and effective method of controlling malaria. Further, large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Rainfed crop production in the semi-arid areas is associated with high risk of rainfall variability which occasionally leads to complete crop failure. Most of the farmers in Atsbi-Womberta district of Eastern Tigray region, northern Ethiopia, have been classified as food insecure. To improve farmers’ livelihoods in the district, interventions targeted at resource conservation and better use of conserved water for market-oriented irrigated crops development have been promoted. This paper analyses the process and outcome of shifting towards market-oriented irrigated crops development and compares variation in income between beneficiary and nonbeneficiary households. The transformation processes are based on market-oriented diversification into high value irrigated crops, based on a value chain approach, and demand driven, participatory and knowledge based extension. The paper also assesses the response of smallholder farmers to emerging opportunities and challenges, and the spectrum of transformation processes and strategies followed to bring changes in smallholder farmers’ income. The changes associated with the interventions were systematically captured using household level surveys, specialized studies and key informant interviews. Results show that farmers gradually shifted to non-cereal, more market-oriented irrigated crops, in which the share of market-oriented irrigated crops increased from 27% of the total irrigated land in 2004 to 89% in 2009. Similarly, the total irrigated area increased by about fourfold and the number of beneficiaries by about threefold due to improved use of conserved surface and groundwater, and investment in farmer skills and water lifting devices. Moreover, crop diversification and intensification of households increased in response to emerging opportunities and challenges. Annual cropping intensity shifted from mono-crop cereal to 2–3 high value diversified crop farming by some farmers. On aggregate, average income of beneficiary households increased by about ninefold compared to non-beneficiary households. In the transformation, there have been continuous and interconnected processes and strategies in improving the effectiveness of adopting and using new skills and knowledge in harvesting and productive use of water, and responsive capacity of the extension system and partners. The lessons imply that investment in resources conservation could be enhanced if linked with short-term income generating activities through linkages with markets.

TI  - Planning and Corrupting Water Resources Development: The Case of Small Reservoirs in Ghana
AU  - Venot, Jean-Philippe

AU  - Pinkstaff, Crossley Beth
AB  - Agricultural (water) development is once again at the fore of the development agenda of sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, corruption is seen as a major obstacle to the sustainability of future investments in the sector but there is still little empirical evidence on the ways corruption pervades development projects. This paper documents the planning and implementation processes of two specific small reservoir programmes in the north of Ghana. We specifically delve into the dynamics of corruption and interrogate the ways they add to the inherent unpredictability of development planning. We argue that operational limitations of small reservoirs such as poor infrastructure, lack of managerial and organisational capacity at the community level and weak market integration and public support are the symptoms – rather than inherent problems – of wider lapses in the planning processes that govern the development of small reservoirs in Ghana and plausibly worldwide. A suite of petty misconduct and corrupt practices during the planning, tendering, supervision, and administration of contracts for the rehabilitation and construction of small reservoirs results in delays in implementation, poor construction, escalating costs, and ultimately failures of small reservoirs vis-à-vis their intended goals and a widely shared frustration among donor agencies, civil servants, contractors, and communities. Such practices hang on and can only be addressed through a better understanding of the complex web of formal decisions and informal rules that shape the understanding and actions of the state.

AB  - The Nepal West Gandak Irrigation System is one of the first large-scale canal irrigation schemes in developing countries that have been handed over to farmers. The new Water User Association (WUA) also undertook innovative efforts to include women. Therefore, this scheme was selected for the present research, which examines the gendered organization of irrigated farming and identifies processes of inclusion and exclusion of women irrigators and women leaders in the committees, with the aim of formulating recommendations for gender inclusiveness of the new organization. The sample considered for this study consisted of 45 male-headed households (MHHs) and 19 de jure and de facto female-headed households (FHHs). Although irrigation is often assumed to be a male task in MHHs, women were sole irrigators in 7 percent of the MHHs and they irrigated jointly with their male kin in 36 percent of the cases. Expectedly, in FHHs this proportion was higher with 40 percent of the women being the sole irrigators. However, in absolute numbers scheme-wide, most women irrigators belong to MHHs. Systematic differences between male and female irrigators were found in various aspects of irrigation, such as field irrigation strategies, attendance at informal or formal meetings of water users, conflicts faced in accessing water, night irrigation, ethnicity-based social restrictions in carrying out maintenance work, and application of the new share system and payment of irrigation fees. Possible solutions recommended are: better water distribution arrangements, inclusion of women landowners, forms of joint membership for women farm decision makers without land titles, and more liberal participation of women in labor contributions and informal and formal fora. Such measures may also benefit both women who lease-out their land because of problems in irrigation and men who have occupations other than farming. The study also evaluated the recent initiative of the management of the WUA to appoint women members in committees at the lowest and highest tiers of the WUA. Positive impacts were that a new pool of women irrigators was tapped for leadership, a rare occurrence, and that meetings became more orderly. Problems that emerged were the recruitment procedure was not transparent, the roles of the new committee members were unclear for both men and women, and that women leaders lacked training and capacity building, also by male colleagues. Last, the study showed the 44 percent of the poorest households but none of the better-off households used canal water for purposes other than irrigation. Hence, rights to water for multiple purposes by poor men and women, who are often landless and completely excluded from the WUA, need more attention.

AB  - The support provided by the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India) to the Jambar Women Irrigation Group in Bharuch, Gujarat, increased women’s benefits from irrigation intervention and fundamentally challenged prevailing patterns of male ownership and management of irrigation equipment. The experience highlights the often-untapped potential for gender-balanced irrigation intervention wherever women share in farm activities and decision making. The modest aim of this paper is to document this “best practice.” The report is based on various visits to the group during 1999 and the insightful discussions held with its 22 members, with some of their husbands, and with the staff of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India) (AKRSP [I]) who also provided background material.

The normative framework for human development is today reflected in the broad vision set out in the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed set of timebound goals for reducing extreme poverty, extending gender equality and advancing opportunities for health and education. Progress towards these objectives provides a benchmark for assessing the international community’s resolve in translating commitments into action. More than that, it is a condition for building shared prosperity and collective security in our increasingly interdependent world.

TI  - The impact on farm household welfare of large irrigation dams and their distribution across hydrological basins: Insights from northern Nigeria
AU  - Takeshima, Hiro
AB  - Despite substantial past investment and continued interest in irrigation dam construction in Nigeria, evidence on the impact of such dams on household welfare is generally scarce. In particular, relatively few studies have been done on the geographical scope that their benefits may reach, despite growing evidence from elsewhere that the benefits of large irrigation dams can extend beyond the districts or hydrological basins that contain them, reaching particularly to hydrological basins located downstream. This study assesses the short-term effects of large irrigation dams on household consumption in the northern part of Nigeria. Using two rounds of the Nigeria LSMS survey, we apply multinomial logit inverse probability weighting (MIPW) methods to construct matching samples across three different types of hydrological basins – dam basins, which are basins that contain large irrigation dams and the area upstream of such dams; downstream basins, which are located downstream of large irrigation dams; and non-dam basins, which are not associated with large irrigation dams. Our analyses particularly focus on the benefits provided by such dams for mitigating the drought risks faced by farm households. Drought is an important factor that affects adversely the welfare of farm household in Nigeria. Supplemental irrigation is often used during drought to provide water to crops. We find that in 2010 and 2012 farm households in downstream basins were relatively less affected by drought and enjoyed relatively stable between-season growth rates of real per capita income and food consumption compared to comparable households in dam basins or in non-dam basins. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that such households are able to limit the damage drought might cause on their own food production. We link these findings to the following policy messages: (1) downstream hydrological basins are important geographical units to include in assessing the benefits from construction of large irrigation dams in Nigeria; and (2) decisions on where to construct new large irrigation dams or which existing dams to rehabilitate should be partly guided by information on the agricultural productivity and income levels of households in downstream hydrological basins relative to the basins within which construction or rehabilitation of such dams is planned.

TI  - Bureaucratic Reform in Irrigation: A Review of Four Case Studies
AU  - Suhardiman, Diana
AU  - Giordano, Mark
AB  - Poor performance of government-managed irrigation systems persists globally. This paper argues that addressing performance requires not simply more investment or different policy approaches, but reform of the bureaucracies responsible for irrigation management. Based on reform experiences in The Philippines, Mexico, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan, we argue that irrigation (policy) reform cannot be treated in isolation from the overall functioning of government bureaucracies and the wider political structure of the states. Understanding of how and why government bureaucracies shape reform processes and outcomes is crucial to increase the actual significance of reforms. To demonstrate this, the paper links reform processes in the irrigation sector with the wider discourse of bureaucratic reform in the political science, public administration, and organisational science literature. Doing so brings to light the need for systematic comparative research on the organisational characteristic of the irrigation bureaucracies, their bureaucratic identities, and how these are shaped by various segments within the bureaucracies to provide the insights needed to improve irrigation systems performance.

AB  - This paper examined the patterns and determinants of agricultural labour productivity among countries in West African sub-region over the period 1970 – 2004. The study was based on panel data extracted from FAOSTAT, the online statistical database of the Food and Agriculture Organisation as well as the database of United Nations Statistics Division and the Microsoft Encarta Encyclopaedia CD-ROM. The data were analyzed by a combination of descriptive and regression methods. The study revealed that eight (8) of the sixteen (16) West African countries (Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Senegal and Togo) had average labour productivities that were lower during the 20002004 period than the average they stated with during the 1970s. The West-African average labour productivity ranged between 484.72 and 536.52 from 1970 to 2004. Regression analyses revealed that agricultural labour productivity among countries in the sub-region would rise with increase in literacy rates, increase in capital formation (savings), increase in rates of fertilizer and tractor use as well as increase in proportion of agricultural land put under irrigation (p<0.01). However, periods of military rule and civilian dictatorship (one party state) were identified as being associated with significantly lower agricultural labour productivity in the sub-region. It is recommended that Governments in West Africa should intensify their efforts in providing basic education to their people as well as providing support for increased private sector participation in the procurement and distribution of critical inputs like fertilizer, tractors services, etc.

A3  - International Water Management Institute
AB  - This paper offers an assessment of the social impact of treadle pump technology for manual irrigation in eastern India, the Nepal Terai, and Bangladesh, South Asia’s so-called “poverty square.” This region where 500 million of the world's poorest people live is underlain by one of the world’s best groundwater resources. Treadle pump technology can be a powerful tool for poverty reduction in this region. It “self-selects”1 the poor and it puts to productive use the region’s vast surplus family labor. It is claimed that the treadle pump could raise the annual net household income by US$100, on the average. This report reviews evidence from a variety of studies—including our own—designed to test these claims, and concludes that:

a) Treadle pump technology does self-select the poor, although the first-generation adopters tend to be the less poor. b) It does raise net annual incomes of adopter households by US$50-500, with the modal value in the neighborhood of US$100. It transforms smallholder farming systems in different ways in different sub-regions; in north Bengal and Bangladesh, treadle pump adopters take to cultivation of high-yielding rice in the boro season while elsewhere adopters turn to vegetable cultivation and marketing. c) Treadle pump use results in increased landuse intensity as well as “priority cultivation.” Adopters use crop-saving irrigation in a large part of their holding but practice highly intensive farming in the “priority plot.”

AU  - Schraven, Benjamin
AB  - Shallow groundwater irrigation farming is a rural livelihood adaptation process in Northern Ghana initiated as a response towards a livelihood context that is mainly characterised by processes of ecological change. These patterns of change are - as described in chapter IV.1 - mainly caused by changing climatic conditions; to a lesser extent, also local factors, such as deforestation or processes of soil erosion, are threatening subsistence farming, which still is the main livelihood of a majority of the region’s population. Shallow groundwater irrigation (SGI) is an example for a purely farmer driven local innovation and adaptation process without any involvement of state agencies, NGOs or (international) donor organizations.

AU  - Peter, Graciana
AB  - The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of improved access and use of irrigation schemes on livelihoods and food security. A questionnaire was used to solicit information from four purposefully sampled communities on: crops grown and irrigated; output, disposal; status of food security; sources and means used to secure food. Analysis involved comparisons between situations before and after water schemes and between irrigation schemes. Results showed when irrigation schemes are focused at household level and to the fields around the home they contribute to income generation and food security. Majority irrigated their maize (71.8%) and other food crops, vegetables and fruits. Highest proportions of the food insecure were in communities where irrigation scheme was not focused at household level. Irrigation shifted production from subsistence to commercial as well from household to community or association based livelihoods, where individuals are not directly involved in production. Irrigation schemes must be focused to households and fields around homes to improve food security.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of irrigation on household food security and poverty using a case study of Bwanje Valley Irrigation Scheme in Malawi. Data used in the analysis were collected from 412 households – 169 participants in the irrigation scheme and 243 non-participants. Due to the non-random selection of participants into the irrigation scheme, the study used endogenous switching regression to correct for sample selection bias. Propensity score matching was then used to measure the impact of irrigation on food security and poverty. Daily per capita caloric intake and agricultural income were the proxy measures used to measure food security and poverty, respectively. Despite farmers selling paddy rice at the farm gate on an individual basis and operating in an environment with inadequate water supply, the findings revealed that irrigation had a positive impact on annual agricultural income and daily per capita caloric intake. The impact of irrigation on household annual agricultural income was different among the participants, with those cultivating both rice and maize under irrigation earning more agricultural income than their counterparts growing rice only. The results also showed a positive impact of irrigation on daily per capita caloric intake, with both groups of irrigating farmers realizing similar improved levels of caloric intake over farmers that did not participate in the irrigation scheme. In addition, traditionally marginalized groups – households headed by youth, female-headed households, and low-income households – earned more agricultural income than what they would have earned if they did not participate in the irrigation scheme. The recommendations from the study are that irrigation interventions should be up scaled to other areas with potential irrigable land and should promote the growing of more than one crop. In addition, irrigation schemes should promote bulk marketing of processed rice through contract relationships with institutions (i.e. schools, prisons, hospitals) and private traders.

AB  - Irrigation impacts agricultural wage trends through increased demand for labour, cropping intensity and shift in the cropping pattern from low value crops to high value crops. An attempt is made here to explore the relationship between irrigation development and wage rate of agricultural labourers using statewise cross section data pertaining to five points of time: 1972-73, 1977-78, 1983, 1987-88 and 1993-94. The results of the study show that there is a positive impact of availability of irrigation on real wages of agricultural labourers. Also irrigation helps to narrow down the difference between the statutory minimum wages and prevailing wage rates. The gender wage differential is found to be narrowing at a faster rate in the states where irrigation is higher.

AU  - Barry, B
AB  - Agriculture has a central socioeconomic position in Ghana. This sector accounts for about 65 percent of the work force, about 40 percent of the gross domestic product, and about 40 percent of foreign currencies acquired through exports. Although agriculture is a key part of the country's economy, the structure of the sector is vulnerable because it relies on rainfed agriculture during a roughly six-month rainy season. Droughts and other types of unseasonable weather pose risks for farmers. Under these conditions, irrigation development offers the promise of greater food security and the rural-area development by ensuring yearlong agricultural production. Despite considerable potential for development and the emphasis placed on irrigation development in many plans, less than two percent of the total cultivatable area in Ghana is irrigated. Moreover, even within this small area, researchers lack a clear understanding of where in Ghana different types of irrigation infrastructure are used and to what effect. Less than a third of the estimated total irrigated land in Ghana lies within 22 well-known public schemes, and not enough is known of the location, development and management of the informal irrigation schemes that account for the remaining two-thirds of total irrigated land. Although donors and policymakers express interest in providing new funds for irrigation development, the lack of reliable data on where irrigation currently exists, trends in its development, and opportunities and constraints within formal and informal schemes undermines consensus about how to build on what already exists in the sector. Ghana’s overall national goal is to attain a middle income status with a per capita income of US$1,0001 by the year 2015. The agricultural sector must lead in achieving this national goal, as agriculture employs more than 50 percent of the total economically active population (Kundell 2008). Agriculture in Ghana is predominantly practiced on smallholder, family-operated farms, which produce about 80 percent of total agricultural output. About 2.74 million households either operate small farms (most of themless than 2 hectares) or keep livestock (MOFA 2008). Cultivable land is still abundant as only 38.9 percent of total agricultural land area is currently cultivated. Yet productivity of existing farmland is generally low and uncertain, because of prevailing traditional low-input, shifting-cultivation farming systems and dependence on rainfall. Ghana cannot achieve economic growth and poverty reduction targets without significant improvement in the agricultural sector (Kyei-Baffour and Ofori 2006). Growth in agriculture may be achieved both through extensification (putting more land under cultivation) and intensification (increasing the productivity of existing lan

TI  - Micro-Level Decision for Area Shift in Favour of High-Value Crops: A Case of Horticultural Crops
AU  - Mehta, Pradeep Kumar
AB  - Area shift towards horticultural crops is vital for increasing farm income, productivity and overall employment in the agricultural sector. Several economic (price and income) and non-economic (food-security concerns) factors influence farmers’ decisions at the farm level. This paper has examined the role of both price and income, along with the role of food-security goals, in the decision-making of farmers regarding shift from low-value crops (food crops) to high-value commercial crops (horticultural crops). It has been shown that higher food requirements at home inhibit the extent of crop substitution decision of the farmers. However, farmers are less responsive to the changes in the prices of food grains (in terms of changing their consumption) as higher income from high-value crops provide adequate money to purchase food crops from the market. Relative income (not the relative price) of the crops has been found to explain the cropsubstitution decisions of the farmers. The farmers have been reported to calculate the aggregate gain from the crop rather calculating only the price of the crop, while making the decision to shift. Their capacity to generate higher productivity along with better market prospects have been recorded to explain farmers’ decision to shift area.

The evolution of radical diversification of land production, and the subsequent emergence of different rural economies and changed social patterns following irrigation, are described with a model of three waves of ownership change. There are impacts on land use, ownership, work and paid labour, demography and community social structures. Rural towns can be reluctant to appreciate the potential irrigation offers, the changing demands and opportunities. Positioning is needed to capitalise on their hinterland’s changed production base while managing the social change that will eventuate.

TI  - Improving diet quality and micronutrient nutrition: Homestead food production in Bangladesh.
AB  - A critical yet often overlooked component of food security is diet quality. Even households who have access to sufficient amounts of food and calories may still lack essential micronutrients, increasing their risk for both short- and long-term health and development consequences. Interventions that address poor diet quality and related deficiencies of vitamin A, zinc, iron, among others, are important for achieving full food security in vulnerable populations. The homestead food production (HFP) program, introduced in Bangladesh by Helen Keller International nearly two decades ago, promotes an integrated package of home gardening, small livestock production and nutrition education with the aim of increasing household production, availability, and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods and improving the health and nutritional status of women and children. Implemented by NGO partners and the Government of Bangladesh, HFP has expanded its reach into over one half of the country’s subdistricts and is now operating in several countries of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence shows that HFP in Bangladesh has improved food security for nearly 5 million vulnerable people in diverse agroecological zones. This has been achieved through: increased production and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods; increased income from gardens and expenditures on micronutrient-rich foods; women’s empowerment; enhanced partner capacity; and community development.

AB  - For Bangladesh food security was synonymous with achieving self-sufficiency in rice production and stabilization in rice prices. The country has made good progress in increasing rice production through technological progress, facilitated by private sector investment in small scale irrigation. But, it is difficult to sustain the progress made in view of the growing pressure of population on scarce land resources. Domestic food grain production remains susceptible to floods and droughts thereby perpetuating the threat of major production shortfalls, inadequate food availability, and vulnerability from fluctuation in prices. The availability of other foods has not increased, and the progress in nutritional outcome has remained slow. Forty percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and income inequality has been worsening. This paper assesses the trends in factors that affect food production, availability of food and their impact on nutrition outcomes. It also probes into the trends in poverty and distribution of income and access to food through markets.

AB  - Household food security is an important dimension of well-being. Although it may not encapsulate all dimensions of poverty, the inability of households to obtain access to enough food for an active, healthy life is surely an important component of their poverty. In this context, devising an appropriate measure of food security outcomes is useful for several reasons: ß to identify the food-insecure, ß characterize the nature of their insecurity (for example, seasonal versus chronic), ß monitor changes in their circumstances, assess the impact of interventions. However, obtaining detailed data on food security status—such as 24-hour recall data on calor ic intakes—can be time consuming and expensive. It also requires a high level of technical skill both in data collection and analysis. The juxtaposition of the value of indicators of food security, together with the difficulties in obtaining detailed infor mation, is the motivation for this paper

AU  - Giordano, M.

AU  - Treguer, D. O.
AU  - McCornick, P. G.
AB  - Twenty years ago, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), then known as the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI), published its first Research Report entitled The new era of water resources management: From "dry" to "wet" water savings. The report stressed the increasingly difficult problems facing water management, including growing demands for, and competition over, scarce water resources, and the physical, economic and environmental constraints to developing additional supplies. While a large body of research already existed on opportunities to improve irrigation efficiency and water-use efficiency, David Seckler, the newly appointed Director General of IIMI at that time and author of the research report, argued that the classical notions of ‘efficiency’ may be inappropriate for water management and planning at the basin level, as they do not take into account the potential reuse of water within larger hydrologic systems. To incorporate these reuse effects, Seckler proposed the concept of agricultural water productivity as an alternative metric to guide future basin management strategies aimed at achieving real efficiency gains and real water savings. Since the publication of that first Research Report, improving agricultural water productivity has been a core component of IWMI’s research agenda and a number of initiatives led by the Institute. This Research Report chronicles the evolution of thinking on water productivity in the research agenda of IWMI and in the broader irrigation literature over the past 20 years. It describes the origins of the concept and the methodological developments, its operationalization through applied research, and some lessons learned over the two decades of research. This report further highlights how a focus on agricultural water productivity has brought greater attention to critical water scarcity issues, and the role of agricultural water management in supporting broader development objectives such as increasing agricultural production, reducing agricultural water use, raising farm-level incomes, and alleviating poverty and inequity. Yet, reliance on a single-factor productivity metric, such as agricultural water productivity defined as “crop per drop,” in multi-factor and multi-output production processes can mask the complexity of agricultural systems as well as the tradeoffs required to achieve desired outcomes. The findings from this retrospective underscore the limitations of single-factor productivity metrics while also highlighting opportunities to support more comprehensive approaches to address water scarcity concerns and, ultimately, achieve the broader development objectives. A reflection on the lessons learned is especially relevant given the adoption of the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 and their supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, Goal 6.4 aims to “by 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity, and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.” This is the first time that the efficiency with which water is used has a place on the mainstream development agenda. The insights and opportunities presented in this report are intended to inform the development and application of appropriate indicators and measures to meaningfully track progress towards this stated goal, and support the UN’s broader objective of achieving sustainable development for people, planet and prosperity.

TI  - Impact of Irrigation on Nutrition, Health and Gender: A Review Paper with Insights for Africa south of the Sahar
AB  - Agriculture in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) is still largely rainfed. SSA also exhibits the lowest crop yields for major staples in the world, largely due to low use of irrigation and fertilizer. Rainfed agriculture poses growing production risks with increased climate variability and change. At the same time, smallholder irrigation in the region developed rapidly over the past decade, albeit starting from very low levels. In addition to largely demand-driven irrigation development by smallholders, there is a significant push by donors for large-scale irrigation development, as well as some push for smallholder irrigation. There has also been a long-standing debate about whether irrigation in SSA should be large scale or small scale to achieve its potential. However, given the potentially high rewards, but also high possibility of failure, the assessment of irrigation potential must go beyond large scale versus small scale to integrate concerns regarding environmental sustainability, resource use efficiency, nutrition and health impacts, and women’s empowerment. The hypothesis underlying this review paper is that how irrigation gets deployed in SSA will be decisive not only for environmental sustainability (such as deciding remaining forest cover in the region) and poverty reduction, but also for health, nutrition, and gender outcomes in the region. The focus of this paper is on the health, nutrition, and gender linkage. We find that to date, few studies have analyzed the impact of irrigation interventions on nutrition, health, and women’s empowerment, despite the large potential of irrigation to affect these important variables. Irrigation interventions may have differential effects on different members in the household and in the community, such as irrigators, non-irrigators, children, and women. Measuring and understanding such differences, followed by improving design and implementation to maximize gender, health, and nutrition outcomes, could transform irrigation programs from focusing solely on increased food production toward becoming an integral component of poverty-reduction strategies.

TI  - Access to Irrigation and the Escape from Poverty: Evidence from Northern Mali
AU  - Dillon, Andrew
AB  - Significant changes in the agricultural sector in northern Mali suggest that irrigation has made a large contribution to welfare increases over the past eight years. Using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and matched difference in differences with a small panel, this study estimates the impact of access to irrigation on poverty, production, and nutrient intakes. The findings suggest that gains in agricultural production value do not transfer uniquely to household consumption. The paper tests two alternative hypotheses about the distribution of agricultural gains: (1) the gains in agricultural production induced by irrigation yield higher household savings, or (2) intra-village transfers from irrigators to nonirrigators contribute to informal social insurance. The paper provides evidence of both saving and sharing within villages as complimentary strategies for consuming gains in agricultural production. This finding suggests that estimating the effects of a program, relying solely on household consumption, may underestimate the welfare gains of irrigation investment by ignoring the household’s savings and informal insurance network.

AB  - The case for public subsidy in drip irrigation partly, if not entirely, rests on social returns being far in excess of private returns accruing to drip investors. Estimates of returns to drip investments in India have been reviewed here. In the literature, water savings benefits are understood but not presented as a social benefit. Protective benefits of drip investment, as distinct from its productive benefits, have been recognised, particularly for farmers facing declining water yield in their wells. The monetary value of these benefits must be determined and incorporated into benefit-cost estimates.

AB  - This document provides a review of the agricultural productivity literature while identifying the various methodologies used and important results for policy formulation purposes. Agricultural productivity is a key driver for the well being of the farmers, the agro-based industry and mankind at large and has important policy implications. Results from the studies imply that productivity growth has been significant at the country level and more recently at the state/provincial/regional level even though there were some difference among states/provinces regarding productivity growth. There is some evidence of agricultural productivity growth slowdown. The literature review also revealed that methods, measures of variables and model specifications used to estimate productivity growth could affect the estimation of productivity growth and its determinants. Regarding method of estimation, overtime there has been a shift from simple indexing to econometric analysis and a complex combination of econometric analysis and non-parametric techniques. Overtime, studies have shifted from using national level aggregate data to regional/provincial level disaggregated data. R&D and technological progress have been identified as the most important determinant of agricultural productivity growth. However, agricultural research funding has been declining. Finally, the difference in productivity growth among countries could be explained by difference in resource endowment, research expenditures (R&D) and the resulting technological progress, and the accumulation of human capital. Hence, increasing funding for agricultural research that increases technical progress should be an essential part of the overall agriculture policies as it could improve agricultural productivity growth significantly. There is also the need for more studies in this important area.

AB  - Although the establishment of Panganai small scale irrigation was in an endeavour to improve the welfare of the people it remains a pressing issue as economic and social problems continue to affect plot holders which results in the scheme being undermined. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of small scale irrigation scheme on the people’s livelihoods in Panganai Communal area. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used in the investigation of the impact of the scheme on rural livelihoods. A sample of fifty respondents out of a total of two hundred plot holders was selected using random sampling. Data was collected using interviews, questionnaires and observation. Analyses were done using descriptive statistics. Tables and graphs were employed in presentation and analysis. Results were that the irrigation scheme has managed to create employment, income generation, supply water throughout the year, acquisition of assets such as scotch carts and livestock by farmers and school fees generation by the community as a whole. However the yields produced have not yet addressed the food security situation of plot holders. This is attributed to prohibitive water pricing and transport costs which negatively affected their desire to produce at maximum capacity. However the intervention by interested stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations and Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) as well as economic recovery programmes like such as farm mechanization are recommended to ensure the viability and sustainability of irrigation on rural livelihoods.

TI  - Assessment of a Smallscale Irrigation Scheme on Household Food Security and Leisure in Kokoligu; Ghana
AU  - Bagson, Ernest

AB  - The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of a small scale irrigation scheme on household food security and leisure time of the people in Kokoligu - a subsistence-based farming community in the Nandom District of Ghana. A total of fifty household heads adequately represented Kokoligu as homogenous community via simple random sampling technique. In-depth interview (IDI) schedules and observation guides were used to source information on food security situations before and after introducing the irrigation scheme and the effects of the scheme on residents’ leisure during the off farming season. The study revealed that the irrigation scheme enhanced household food security and wellbeing during the off farming (dry) season but significantly reduced leisure; communal intimacy in addition to degrading the cultural heritage in the study area. Majority of the farmers (83%) irrigated vegetables, for household consumption and sale to complement the significant proportion of staple food crops (maize, millet and rice) cultivated during farming season to salvage their nutritional needs. With regard to the fading cultural heritage and communal intimacy, the paper recommended that cultural reawakening should be pursued through both formal education in schools and informal education by initiatives of the community elders and the traditional council.

AB  - Agricultural intensification is presumed to be a necessary pre-condition for the development of the agricultural sector in Ethiopia. To this end, various government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), among others, initiated small-scale irrigation schemes throughout the country including the Tigray region. Despite these efforts, however, smallholder farmers particularly in the study area are found to be reluctant to participate in small-scale irrigation schemes. This study therefore, assessed the factors that affect smallholder farmers’ participation in small-scale irrigation of the study area. A two-stage sampling procedure was used to first select peasant associations and then sample respondents. Descriptive statistics and binary probit estimation were used to estimate the determinants of small-scale irrigation participation. The analysis revealed that income, gender, access to market information and health condition of households were found to be important determinants for participating in small scale irrigation schemes. Hence, improving rural farm households’ access to market information and health services, are likely to improve participation in irrigation schemes thereby improving of small holder farmers income.

TI  - Improving food hygiene in Africa where vegetables are irrigated with polluted water
AU  - Amoah, Philip
AB  - Due to inappropriate and inadequate urban sanitation infrastructure in Ghana wastewater from households and other facilities ends up in nearby water bodies, which are often used as sources of irrigation water. However, this practice could have adverse public health and environmental effects, especially because untreated wastewater has high population of pathogenic organisms. The purpose of this study was to determine the current level of exposure of the Ghanaian local population to faecal coliform (FC) through the consumption of wastewater irrigated vegetables and to analyse and improve the effectiveness of common washing methods for the reduction of faecal microorganism populations on the surface of wastewater-irrigated vegetables. The levels of pathogen on market vegetables produced with wastewater were determined. Questionnaire interviews were also used to gather information on common methods used for washing vegetables in 11 cities in West Africa. The efficacy of the common decontamination methods was measured in terms of log reductions in FC populations on homogenised contaminated vegetable samples. High FC and helminth eggs contamination levels exceeding common guidelines for food quality were recorded on the market vegetables. Methods used to wash vegetables vary widely within and between Ghana and neighbouring francophone West African (WA) countries. However, several of the most common methods do not reduce the contamination to any desirable level. Significantly, different log reductions are achieved depending on the washing method and contact time. Tests to improve the apparent ineffective methods were especially promising in view of the relatively expensive vinegar. However, up to 3 log units reduction is also possible at a much lower price with ‘Eau de Javel’ (bleach), which is commonly used in francophone WA. Washing vegetables before consumption is important for health risk reduction. However, any washing method will need complementary efforts to reduce pathogen contamination.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of small-scale irrigation on farm households‟ technical efficiency of production in Eastern, Oromia, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data were collected for the study. Primary data were collected from 200 sample respondents drawn from both participant and non-participant households in 2012 production year. Stochastic production frontier model was used for technical efficiency estimation and Propensity score matching method was applied to analyze the impact of small-scale irrigation on the farm household‟s technical efficiency with the help of logistic regression function to estimate propensity scores. In matching processes, kernel matching with band width of 0.5 was found to be the best matching algorism. Households that participate in irrigation practice have got an improvement of 8.92% in technical efficiency than those households that were not participating in irrigation practice. Participation in irrigation has a significant, positive and robust impact on the outcome variables. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the impact estimates are insensitive to unobserved selection bias. All results obtained from different models revealed the positive impact of irrigation on farm household technical efficiency. Therefore, policy makers should give due emphasis to the aforementioned variables to increase participation in irrigation farming and improve the livelihood of rural households.

AU  - Sekyi-Annan, Ephraim
AB  - Small dams offer a lifeline to rural communities in northern Ghana during the dry season. The paper discusses issues related to water use, socio-economic significance, and sustainability of small dams following substantial State interventions and donor agency investments in the development and management of small dams in Ghana. Through the lenses of political economy narrative, the paper explores the political, economic and social realities that shape the development, operation, and management of small dams. Evidence from sixteen small dams examined, using multiple indicator approach revealed overall satisfactory to highly satisfactory performance indices for small dams. Economic returns from irrigation offer incentives to improve performance but give limited account of performance dynamics of small dams. A holistic view of values and priority attached to multiple uses account for satisfactory performance. Whilst operational limitations of small dams prevail, the paper argues that moving beyond ‘technical or engineering fix’ and focusing on limitations in national and local institutional arrangements, politics, interests, and rights are crucial for effective planning, management, and enhanced performance of small dams.

TI  - A study of economic and social impact of three irrigation schemes in Dedza and Ntcheu districts
AU  - Concern Universal
AB  - A study was conducted to assess the extent to which forecasts that were made about the social and economic benefits of rural irrigation schemes were actually realised on the ground. This study was conducted in Mgundu and Livizi 2 irrigation schemes in Dedza district and Upper Masasa (UMA) 6 scheme in Ntcheu district. Data gathered from field research and from interviews with scheme participants has been compared to the intended outcomes as stated in the original technical proposals and terms of references for the schemes. While this study focused on 3 specific irrigations schemes its findings and recommendations are widely applicable to many rural irrigation schemes. The findings show that the development of the three schemes contributed to increased numbers of households participating in irrigated crop production particularly the female farmers from female headed households. The schemes also contributed to an increased number of households producing one or more irrigated crops per year. The production levels and trends for the three main irrigated crops in the schemes, (maize, tomatoes and Irish potatoes), show that the current levels of production in the schemes are subsistence oriented. While female farmers cultivated bigger areas than male farmers their average annual production of each of the three crops were lower than their male counterparts. Male farmers produced more because they had better access to farm inputs, skills and time than their female counterparts and as a result achieved higher incomes. The households noted that irrigation scheme had significantly contributed to dietary diversity in two ways. First, there was increased production and availability of staple foods, vegetables and legumes. Secondly, the money realised from sales enabled household to buy other food products such as fish, meat and cooking oil which were normally not readily available in their household. Where Persons living with HIV, (PLHIV) and others affected by HIV are involved in irrigation schemes, they derive a lot of benefits in terms of food and nutrition security, economic empowerment, high productivity and social acceptance. However, in the schemes where such people are not involved, there are usually high cases of stigma and discrimination and the PLHIV and others affected by HIV are not benefiting much from irrigated agriculture. There have been no significant recorded impacts on downstream water quality; this is largely attributed to the use of vegetative filter buffers. Two of the schemes utilised rivers that had flows large enough for downstream quantity not to be affected by the scheme. At the third however the level of river abstraction was higher than the recommended 50% of the stream. The implication was that during minimal flow rate in October-November, the entire flow was diverted to the scheme. Unlined canals are leading to excessive seepage at two of the schemes. This is leading to inadequate supply to some of the plots. As a result the irrigated hectarage is significantly lower than designed. At the third scheme, over abstraction has made it possible to irrigate over four times the designed area. Poor design and construction of the extra plots however has led to issues with in-plot ponding and soil erosion. It was revealed through the study that the sustainable supply of inputs, particularly to vulnerable household, remains a serious challenge. The current crop production levels and trends in the schemes are of subsistence nature. If households are to realise food security as well as increased household incomes, there is need for diversification and increase in the levels of cash crop production in order to balance between production of maize for food and cash crops All of the schemes have established effective management structures. While the households were working together in aspects of maintenance of the scheme and watering, joint production planning was only done in the first two years in all the three schemes and later abandoned.

As most of the households were growing green maize as the main cash crop, and the buyers were vendors from neighbouring villages who could only buy a few hundred cobs, there was no need for the households to work as group to market their green maize. Currently each farmer operates independently in terms of production and marketing of the crops grown. For the UMA 6 scheme, a thorough feasibility study was completed investigating the suitability for the area for a scheme. This included gathering social, economic and demographic data of potential beneficiaries of the programme, understanding the social-cultural variables in relation to land ownership that will affect the proposed programme as well as environmental investigation into the suitability and impact of the scheme. A cost benefit analysis was undertaken and wider issues such as gender and HIV and AIDS were assessed. For this scheme the majority of its aims were achieved, in particular:  Increased food security, dietary diversity and household income was achieved  Gender training led to high levels of gender understanding and equality within the project  Deliberate inclusion of PLHIV has largely led to benefits for affected households  The scheme has not had a negative impact on the surrounding environment  The scheme has an effective management structure which coordinates plot ownership, payments, and a maintenance fund There were however some areas where the aims were not realised:  Targets for the number of crops produced per year are largely not being achieved – this is attributed to poor production planning, unfavourable growing conditions such as frost, access to inputs as well issues with the operation of the schemes themselves.  Insufficient funding has meant that there is a large portion of the main and secondary canals that are unlined. As a result water is lost to seepage which leads to both water shortages at some plots, as well as ponding at other  In some cases the requirements placed upon scheme members was discouraging participation of PLHIV; such as plots being allocated only to those that participated in the hard work of clearing the irrigation land and developing the irrigation channels. The remaining plots are obtained through annual rental fees, which some of the PLHIV interviewed found unaffordable  Joint production planning has been abandoned due to limited access to large markets. Farmers are now working independently on crop planning and marketing In comparison for Mgundu, the project design report included environmental considerations for the project such as water requirements, topographic and soil surveys, as well technical design details. Wider issues such HIV/AIDS and gender dimensions were not included. The feasibility study for the Livizi 2 scheme could not be obtained. For these two schemes it has not therefore been possible to evaluate the success of the projects comprehensively with relation to the original objectives; nevertheless the successes and short-fallings of these schemes provide valuable information for both contextual understanding and future planning.

AB  - This literature review has been carried out to explore the range of issues covered in the available literature on irrigation in India and to bring together the interesting hypotheses developed, and findings of studies done thus far so as to serve as a reference and guide for future research in this field. It would also try to highlight the important dimensions that have been overlooked or understudied in the existing literature so that further research can be taken up to plug the gap. The review limits itself to the works on socio-economic impacts. Studies on feasibility of irrigation projects, their environmental impacts and irrigation management turnover have not been covered in the review. This is a review of studies on canal irrigation projects but a few important studies on groundwater have been referred to for comparison and facilitating a better understanding of the interrelationship between the surface and groundwater irrigation systems.

AU  - Titiati, Atsu
AB  - Treadle pump (TP) technology has been promoted by Enterprise Works Worldwide (EWW) in West Africa as an alternative to the traditional rope and bucket irrigation that is necessary to overcome the challenge of uncertain and inadequate rainfall for agricultural production. The aim is to improve output, increase incomes and reduce poverty among rural farm households. This study examines the strategies used for dissemination of the TP and the dynamics of its adoption and impacts, with a special focus on poverty reduction. The data source for the study is a primary survey involving interviews with adopters and non-adopters of TP in the Volta and Ashanti regions of Ghana. The results of the study reveal that time and labor savings for irrigation, increased size of irrigated areas and lack of fuel requirements are the attractive features of the TP for those who adopt it. Almost all the TP adopters in the research sample were men. About 26 percent of the adopters achieved an increase in irrigated area; all saved time spent on irrigation and increased net farm income. The productivity of land and labor increased, while the welfare of adopters improved. The study demonstrates that adoption of TP reduces poverty. A positive impact on human capital was realized as incomes were used to pay for children’s schooling and for health care. Some farmers, however, stopped the use of the TP, mostly because it broke down and could not be used over large extents of land. Also, about 10 percent of the adopters were able to shift to motorized pumping. It is recommended that a variety of improvements in design, dissemination and capacity might improve the impact of TP technology in West Africa. Increased collaboration with local institutions such as extension services could make the TP reach the farmers better. In this regard, a long-term program would be more effective than short-term projects. Design improvements should be undertaken to ease pedaling so as to encourage the uptake of the TP by women and enhance their chance of benefiting directly from it. The introduction of after-sales service and training of farmers on minor repairs will improve the continuous use and sustainability of the TP.

AB  - In assessing the anticipated impacts of climate change on agriculture and agricultural water management, it is clear that water availability (from rainfall, watercourses and aquifers) will be a critical factor. Substantial adaptation will be needed to ensure adequate supply and efficient utilization of what will, in many instances, be a declining resource. However, the long-term climatic risk to agricultural assets and agricultural production that can be linked to water cannot be known with any certainty. While temperature and pressure variables can be projected by global circulation models with a high degree of ‘convergence’, the same cannot be said of water vapour in the atmosphere. The levels of risk associated with rainfall and runoff events can only be determined with provisional levels of precision. These may not be sufficient to define specific approaches or levels of investment (e.g. the costs of raising the free-board on an hydraulic structure) in many locations. The evidence for climate change is now considered to be unequivocal, and trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature and sea-level rise are tracking the upper limit of model scenarios elaborated in the Fourth Assessment (AR4) undertaken by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). There remain many scientific questions related to cause and effect that are not yet fully explained, but the probable future costs of climate change are so significant that action now is considered to be a prudent insurance. Current negotiations focus on stabilizing end-of-century temperatures at no more than 2  ̊C to minimize negative impacts. The criticism that climate science has recently taken does not detract from the reality nor the gravity of the clear trends in global climate.

The prediction of impacts relies heavily on simulation modelling with global climate models (GCMs) that have been calibrated as closely as possible to historical climate data. Modelling scenarios have been standardized from a set defined by the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) to allow more consistent comparison of predicted impacts. The predictive ability of climate models is currently much better for temperature than for rainfall. Indeed, models tend to solve primarily on temperature and pressure. The spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are affected by land-atmosphere interactions that cannot be accomodated in the existing algorithms, and the models’ spatial resolution is anyway too coarse to capture many topographic effects on climate patterns. The predictions for one scenario of economic development vary considerably from model to model, and contradictory predictions, such as increased or decreased precipitation, can result for specific parts of the world. Ensemble modelling has become increasingly useful in identifying both the range, and the most likely future conditions for a given scenario, and rapid progress is being made with the development of finer resolution Regional Climate Models (RCM) to downscale predictions to national and river basin scales. The impact of climate change on water and agriculture requires the use of simulation models to predict the distribution and extent of change in key variables that govern crop growth (temperature and evaporative demand) and water availability (rainfall, evaporation, stream flow and groundwater recharge). Water management for agriculture encompasses all technologies and practices that sustain optimum soil moisture conditions for plant growth; these range from enhancing the capture and retention of rainfall to full-scale irrigation of crops where there may be no rainfall at all. It also includes the provision of drainage, and the avoidance and mitigation of flooding. Irrigated agriculture is the largest user of raw water and therefore the main concern of this publication. The anticipated impacts of climate change pose an additional stress on food production systems under pressure to satisfy the food needs of a rapidly growing and progressively wealthier world. As agriculture develops and becomes more intensive in its use of land and water resources, its impact on natural eco-systems becomes more and more apparent. Damaging the integrity of these ecosystems undermines the food-producing systems that they support. The assessment of viable and effective adaptations to the impacts of climate change on water and agriculture will require a sound understanding and integration of agronomic science with water management and hydrology. Due regard for the resulting environmental interactions and trade-offs will be essential. This publication first summarizes the challenges facing agriculture and water without climate change. It then considers the broad and more specific impacts of climate change in different regions of the world, and looks at the options for adaptation and mitigation in some detail. It attempts to reach a practical focus without excessive generalization. The conclusion focuses on action needed to assist countries, in particular developing countries, in assessing probable climate change impacts on irrigated agriculture and on food production, and in adapting agricultural water management to cope with the range and depths of anticipated impacts.

AB  - Project R7879, “Contribution of Irrigation to Sustaining Rural Livelihoods”, has the purpose of seeking to help governments reduce poverty in rural areas in developing countries by providing information and policy guidelines to ensure that irrigated agriculture secures productive livelihoods for the poor. Primary research for the project is to be conducted on case-study irrigation systems in Bangladesh and Nepal. This literature review examines agricultural intensification through the practice of irrigation as a strategy for sustainable rural livelihoods. Core concepts to be applied in the research are those of the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), as described by DFID (1999). These emphasise that the approach will be peoplecentred, holistic and dynamic in seeking to understand, learn from and build upon the changes introduced by irrigation development. It will start from an analysis of people’s assets, opportunities and constraints, seeking to build on existing povertyreducing potential and emphasising the issue of sustainability. Asset endowments to be considered are the five forms of ‘capital’: human, physical, social, natural and financial. Further emphases are the linkages between activities at the macro and micro levels and the importance of the policy and institutional environment in influencing chosen livelihood strategies and outcomes. There is also a need to understand the ‘vulnerability context’: the trends (e.g. economic and technological), shocks (e.g. climatic or market related) and cultural practices, which affect livelihoods. Poverty can be characterised in numerous ways, ranging from traditional approaches that emphasise low consumption or income, to broader conceptions of well-being or livelihood. No single measure will be adopted for this research, which will draw on a range of primary and secondary information sources in assessing poverty in the casestudy areas. Applying the concepts of the SLA, broad and multiple measures of poverty will be used, including assessment of vulnerability/resilience, asset endowments, participation and empowerment.

TI  - A gender performance indicator for irrigation: Concepts tools and applications
AU  - van Koppen, Barbara
AB  - Although gender is a priority on the agendas of irrigation policy makers, interventionists, irrigation leaders and researchers, the gap between positive intentions and concrete action is still considerable. An important but hitherto ignored cause for this gap lies in the lack of adequate conceptualization and methodological tools that provide the insights that policy makers and change agents need. The challenges to improve the current body of knowledge on gender and irrigation are fourfold. First, in order to accommodate the huge variation in the gendered organization of farming across the globe, policy makers and change agents need generic analytical tools that capture relevant and site-specific issues in any irrigation context, including the role of irrigation agencies themselves. Second, concepts need to be accurate and valid. Water obtains its value only as input in an encompassing farm enterprise. The significance of water for women farm decisionmakers, who mobilize inputs themselves, differs fundamentally from its importance for women who are family laborers in farm households managed by their male kin. This needs to be taken into account in conceptualizing water in the gendered organization of farming, preferably quantitatively. Third, analytical tools for gender analysis should be easy to apply in an intervention context. Last but not least, the meaning and merits of “genderinclusiveness” need to be clear, widely endorsed and well corroborated by evidence in order to serve as a generic yardstick for measuring “good gender performance.” The consensus that women farm decisionmakers perform as well as men farm decisionmakers, provided women have equal access to resources, is widely accepted. In this context, irrigation institutions that provide water resources equally to women farm decision-makers as to men farm decision-makers have a “good gender performance.” Such performance boosts the productivity of schemes and increases incomes for both genders. These four challenges incited the Poverty, Gender and Water Project of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) to develop a Gender Performance Indicator for Irrigation (GPII). The Indicator was tested in nine case studies in Burkina Faso, South Africa, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This generic analytical tool answers the question whether irrigation institutions in a particular irrigation scheme are gender-inclusive and, if not, what irrigation agencies themselves can do to affect change. The tool also identifies gender issues that are rooted in a society’s agrarian structure—beyond a strict mandate of irrigation water provision alone. The tool is meant for policy and intervention purposes at all levels and for academic use worldwide. This report presents the underlying concepts of the GPII and methodological guidelines for its application. In addition, salient findings of selected applications of the GPII in Asia and Africa are presented to highlight how the tool captures policy-relevant variation. The GPII seeks to answer two questions for empirical analysis in any particular scheme. The first question is whether the farm decision-makers in a scheme are predominantly male (a male farming system), female (a female farming system) or mixed (a dual farming system). The second question addresses inclusion and exclusion processes of women farm decisionmakers, who are the majority in a female farming system and the minority in a male farming system.

TI  - Livelihoods and Gender Roles in Drip-Irrigation Technology: A Case of Nepal
AU  - Bhawana, Upadhyay

AB  - This paper attempts to understand gender issues in micro-irrigation technology by exploring the dynamics of gender, water and rural livelihoods. Based on an empirical study in the rural areas of West Nepal undertaken in 2003, the paper assesses the socioeconomic impact of drip-irrigation systems on men and women¶s lives. A combination of participatory research tools, participant observation and secondary sources were used to generate data. The study revealed that women extensively contributed to vegetable farming under the drip-irrigation systems. The total time (mean hours) spent by women in vegetable production is significantly higher than those spent by their male counterparts. The benefit cost analysis of vegetable farming has shown overall viability in terms of net present value, benefit cost ratio, internal rate of return and payback period. Based on the study findings, the paper suggests that similar technological interventions could be considered in places of similar socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics to help empower rural women. Finally, the paper raises some significant questions in relation to rural livelihoods and women¶s entitlements.

TI  - Adoption and Impacts of Microirrigation Technologies: Empirical Results from Selected Localities of Maharashtra and Gujarat States of India
AU  - Namara, Regassa

AB  - Microirrigation technologies are aggressively promoted in India by the central government, state governments and many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), both local and international, by providing different kinds of financial, institutional and technical support systems. These technologies are promoted primarily for one or more of the following reasons: (1) as a means to save water in irrigated agriculture, (2) as a strategy to increase income and reduce poverty, and (3) to enhance the food and nutritional security of rural households. Despite the reported significant economic advantages and the concerted support of the government and NGOs, the current microirrigation area in India remains an insignificant proportion of its potential. Based on the data from recent field studies in Maharashtra and Gujarat, this report analyzes: (1) the economics of alternative microirrigation technologies ranging from low-cost drip and sprinkler systems to the capital-intensive systems, (2) the determinants of adoption of microirrigation technology, (3) the poverty outreach of the different microirrigation systems, and (4) the sustainability implications of microirrigation adoption. In line with the findings of numerous other studies, this study indicates that microirrigation technologies result in a significant productivity improvement and, hence, economic gain over the traditional method of surface irrigation. It also shows that the productivity gain of conventional drip systems is significantly higher than that of low-cost drip systems. Thus, low-cost microirrigation systems cannot be regarded as ends in themselves but as stepping stones for adopting the conventional systems, which are technically robust and economically more rewarding. The most important determinants of microirrigation adoption include access to groundwater, the prevailing cropping pattern, level of education, financial resources, the social stratum of the household, and the wealth or poverty status of the farmer. Contrary to expectations, the majority of the current users of low-cost microirrigation systems belong to the richer section of the farming population. The study also indicates that the impact of microirrigation systems on the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources depends on the magnitude of the overall productivity gain following the shift from surface irrigation to microirrigation, the behavior of the adopters following the shift or the pattern of use of the saved water, and the type and potential number of adopters.
