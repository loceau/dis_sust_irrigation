TI  - The Impact of Irrigation on Nutrition, Health, and Gender: A Review Paper With Insights for Africa South of the Sahara
PY  - 2013
AB  - Agriculture in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) is still largely rainfed. SSA also exhibits the lowest crop yields for major staples in the world, largely due to low use of irrigation and fertilizer. Rainfed agriculture poses growing production risks with increased climate variability and change. At the same time, smallholder irrigation in the region developed rapidly over the past decade, albeit starting from very low levels. In addition to largely demand-driven irrigation development by smallholders, there is a significant push by donors for large-scale irrigation development, as well as some push for smallholder irrigation. There has also been a long-standing debate about whether irrigation in SSA should be large scale or small scale to achieve its potential. However, given the potentially high rewards, but also high possibility of failure, the assessment of irrigation potential must go beyond large scale versus small scale to integrate concerns regarding environmental sustainability, resource use efficiency, nutrition and health impacts, and women’s empowerment. The hypothesis underlying this review paper is that how irrigation gets deployed in SSA will be decisive not only for environmental sustainability (such as deciding remaining forest cover in the region) and poverty reduction, but also for health, nutrition, and gender outcomes in the region. The focus of this paper is on the health, nutrition, and gender linkage. We find that to date, few studies have analyzed the impact of irrigation interventions on nutrition, health, and women’s empowerment, despite the large potential of irrigation to affect these important variables. Irrigation interventions may have differential effects on different members in the household and in the community, such as irrigators, non-irrigators, children, and women. Measuring and understanding such differences, followed by improving design and implementation to maximize gender, health, and nutrition outcomes, could transform irrigation programs from focusing solely on increased food production toward becoming an integral component of poverty-reduction strategies.

TI  - Impact of irrigation practices on Gilgel Abay, Ribb and Gumara fisheries, Tana Sub-Basin, Ethiopia.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract In Ethiopia, particularly in Tana Sub-Basin, irrigation development practice is increasing. However, this development ignored the fisheries; no, enough information about its effects. The sub-basin is rich in fisheries, including the 17 Labeobarbus species (the only remaining cyprinid species in the world). The fishery is also supporting over 6000 fishers. Hence, this study investigated the impact of irrigation practices on the Gilgel Abay, Ribb, and Gumara fisheries. Methods include fish sampling below and above the weirs, expert interviews, key informant interviews, secondary data, and impact significance matrix methods. The data collection time was from July 2019 to June 2020. The analysis of the data was qualitative and quantitative. The existing irrigation system affects fisheries by blocking upstream spawning migration routes (Gilgel Abay Weir and Ribb Dam, for sure catch below the Gilgel Abay Weir, significantly higher than above the weir, Shannon Index (H’), P

TI  - Water Reallocation: Drivers, Challenges, Threats, and Solutions for the Poor
PY  - 2008
AB  - With rapid growth in demand for water, the resource is increasingly being transferred from agriculture to cities and industries. This paper examines trends and expected future changes in sectoral water demand, which drive water transfers. It then describes alternative mechanisms for water reallocation, including administrative reallocation, market‐based reallocation, collective negotiation, and other means, including combinations of mechanisms, and illegal transfers. Transfer mechanisms and implications for rural livelihoods and the environment are illustrated for case studies in the western United States and Asia. The paper concludes with a series of suggestions for alternative policies and institutions for reallocation that could help reduce adverse consequences for the poor.

TI  - Public Investment on Irrigation and Poverty Alleviation in Rural Laos
PY  - 2021
AB  - The demand for water is rising rapidly, particularly in agricultural and environmental sectors. This has led to more competition to access limited and scarce water resources. Therefore, choosing an appropriate approach to manage water resources, distribution and allocation, to attain sustainable agriculture is critical for every country worldwide. The most well-known method to preserve or store water and adaptation strategy to climate change is irrigation. This paper wished to understand the impact of irrigation on farmers’ income in Laos, especially from rice, which is the main crop of rural people. The difference in differences (DID) method was employed to estimate the regression results. The DID was estimated by the pooled OLS of the effect on the log of households’ rice farm income and log of households’ total income with household head’s age, education, gender, household size, ethnicity and harvest areas variables pointing out the coefficients of the outcome variables of interest (after treatment) were 0.037 and 0.076 with positive sign but statistically insignificant. The result implies irrigation has no impact on rice products. In other words, irrigation does not increase households’ income. The finding indicates the type of irrigation, the location of the operation headquarters and the management system or governance are crucial factors for explaining the impact of irrigation on the rice products in Laos.

TI  - Groundwater irrigation reduces overall poverty but increases socioeconomic vulnerability in a semiarid region of southern India.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The development of irrigation is generally considered an efficient way to reduce poverty in rural areas, although its impact on the inequality between farmers is more debated. In fact, assessing the impact of water management on different categories of farmers requires resituating it within the different dimensions of the local socio-technical context. We tested this hypothesis in a semi-arid area in Karnataka, South India, where groundwater irrigation was introduced five decades ago. Using the conceptual framework of comparative agriculture, based on farmers' interviews, we built a farm typology, traced the trajectories of farm types over the last decades and assessed their current technical and economic performances. Our results show that the differentiation of farm trajectories since the 1950s has been linked with the development of groundwater irrigation, interplaying with their initial assets, and the evolution of the national and local contexts. We highlight the mechanisms by which irrigation indeed reduces poverty but engenders fragilities, particularly for poor households, whose situation was aggravated by the depletion of water resources over the last two decades. Finally, this extensive understanding of the agrarian context allowed us to formulate and assess the potential of different ways forward, including irrigation technology, change in cropping or livestock systems, land tenure, and value added distribution. As such, this analysis would be of major interest to policy makers involved in reforming the agricultural context for better agricultural water management.

TI  - Impact of Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes on Smallholders Household Income and Food Security in Ethiopia: Review
PY  - 2021
AB  - In Ethiopia, agriculture remains among the most important economic sectors and has been traditionally dominated for centuries by small-scale farmers. Its performance has long been adversely affected by shortage of rain and water to sustain their lives on famine relief support. From the total production of Ethiopia’s, about 97% food crops are produced by rain-fed agriculture, whereas only 3% is from irrigated agriculture. On the other hand, Ethiopia has abundant water resources, but not yet fully benefited from technologies of water management and irrigation. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of small-scale irrigation on household income and food security reviewing different literature. Different studies indicated that access to irrigation water can enable farmers to adopt new technologies and intensify cultivation, leading to increased productivity, production, and greater returns from farming. Access to irrigation enables farmer to grow crops more than once a year increasing production, income and improve their food security status. This review concludes small-scale irrigation is one of the possible solutions to increase smallholder household income and food needs in the country. But there are different challenges hindering the irrigation development by smallholder households like lack of market at the time of harvest, distance from water sources, knowledge on the efficient use of irrigation, and linkage between micro finance institutions and smallholder horticultural crop producers are some constraints. These constraints have to be solved to increase participation of stallholder household in irrigation technology to improve their living standards through this sector.

TI  - Impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security: evidence from Ethiopia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Adamitulu Jido Komoblcha is one of the districts located in lowland areas of the Oromia region with irrigation potentials of 14,000 hectares out of which only 2568 hectares are under small-scale irrigation practices. Though there are a lot of households using irrigation in the study area, the impact that it has brought on the food security of the household is not yet well studied in the area. Several related studies reviewed lack appropriate impact evaluation methods in studying the impact of small-scale irrigation on food security that may result in overestimation or underestimation of the impact. To this end, the main motivation behind this study was to examine whether small-scale irrigation in the study area is creating positive change on household food security or not using the propensity score matching approach. Both primary and secondary data were collected and used in the study. The primary data were collected from randomly selected 94 irrigation users and 100 non-user households from February to March 2018. Secondary data were collected from a review of different works of literature. Both descriptive statistics and econometric models were applied to analyze the data using Stata software version 13. The study applied the propensity score matching (PSM) model to analyze the impact of small-scale irrigation on food security. In analyzing the impact of small scale irrigation on food security, we have used calorie intake, crop harvest and consumption both from own production and bought from the sale of the crop harvest produced through irrigation as an indicator of food security. The study has found that participation in irrigation is positively determined by age, education, land size, access to extension service, and participation in off or non-farm activities. In contrast to this, participation in irrigation is negatively determined by distance from farm plot to water source and distance from the main market. The results of the nearest neighbor and caliper matching estimators show that participation in small-scale irrigation increased the daily calorie intake of the small-scale irrigation users by 643.76 kcal over non-user households. Similarly, it increased their daily calorie intake to 596.43 kcal and 591.74 kcal, respectively, with radius and kernel matching estimators. The result further indicted that irrigation had positive impact on crop production, consumption and revenue generation which all together indicated improvement in food security. The sensitivity analysis test shows that impact results estimated by this study were insensitive to unobserved selection bias which shows it is a real impact of the irrigation. It was concluded that irrigation has a positive and significant impact on household food security. Concerned bodies that working on small-scale irrigation development therefore should continue investment in irrigation activities for poverty reduction strategies and scale-up irrigation interventions to the other areas where there is potentially irrigable land.

TI  - Agricultural water development and households vulnerability to food insecurity: Empirical evidence from Eastern Hararghe Ethiopia
PY  - 2012
AB  - The incidences of food insecurity and poverty are particularly devastating in the developing countries and a lot of resources are being channeled towards programs aimed at eradicating food insecurity. Improvement in access to agricultural water serves as a powerful tool to reduce vulnerability, since it creates options for extended production across the year and increases outputs. However, in some literatures, irrigated agriculture can be more vulnerable for environmental risks as compared to rain fed agriculture. Moreover, it remains unclear whether investment in irrigation infrastructure development led to the desired goals of reducing vulnerability to food insecurity. Therefore, this paper provides results of a study conducted to assess the impact of agricultural water in reducing household vulnerability to food insecurity in eastern Hararghe zone of Ethiopia. A multistage sampling technique was used to select sample household heads. Both Deder and Kersa districts were purposively selected due to availability of modern irrigation schemes. Both primary and secondary data collection methods were employed. Data analysis was involved through descriptive statistics and econometric models. The results of the study showed that increase in proportion of irrigated land size can significantly decrease households’ vulnerability to food insecurity. The study concluded that creating enabling environment in irrigation areas can further decreases households’ vulnerability to food insecurity.

TI  - Entomological Studies on the Impact of a Small-scale Irrigation Scheme on Malaria Transmission around Ziway, Central Ethiopia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Larval and adult anophelines were sampled around Ziway, Central Ethiopia. Throughout the study period, significantly higher densities of Anopheles pharoensis and An. arabiensis were found in the village with irrigation than in the village without. Canal leakage pools, irrigated fields and irrigation canals were the major sources of Anopheles larvae. Most adult anophelines were found to feed on humans, especially before 22hrs, and up to 1% were infected with malaria parasites. This study demonstrated that due to poor maintenance, irrigation schemes create conducive breeding grounds for malaria vector mosquitoes and hence increase the risk of malaria transmission.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Water matters in a world that will soon have to grow food for billions more people. In that context, how should we educate aspiring professionals in the field of irrigation and water resource management? Before attempting an answer to that question we need to explore how the practice and science of irrigation have changed in recent decades. First, we outline the history of irrigation development, identifying the important research issues that were characteristic for each period. The intent is to delineate major trends in the profession, highlighting those changes with implications for university curricula in irrigation and water management. The second part of the paper reviews selected curriculum reform literature and discusses the practicalities of changing from a disciplinary curriculum to multi- or interdisciplinary teaching and research in irrigation and water management. The final section discusses the desired difference between the irrigation curriculum and the water management curriculum.

TI  - Groundwater irrigation for smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa – a synthesis of current knowledge to guide sustainable outcomes
PY  - 2013
AB  - Groundwater irrigation for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa is growing in extent and importance. This growth is primarily driven spontaneously by the farmers themselves, spurred by improved access to low-cost technologies for pumps and drilling services as well as market opportunities for produce. This paper presents a review of the current status and knowledge of the prospects and constraints for sustainable and pro-poor groundwater irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further unlocking the potential of groundwater irrigation for smallholders will require better integrated approaches, simultaneously addressing groundwater-access constraints as well as enabling factors.

TI  - Water for Agriculture: Maintaining Food Security under Growing Scarcity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the main source of water withdrawals, accounting for around 70% of all the world’s freshwater withdrawals. The development of irrigated agriculture has boosted agricultural yields and contributed to price stability, making it possible to feed the world’s growing population. Rapidly increasing nonagricultural demands for water, changing food preferences, global climate change, and new demands for biofuel production place increasing pressure on scarce water resources. Challenges of growing water scarcity for agriculture are heightened by the increasing costs of developing new water, soil degradation, groundwater depletion, increasing water pollution, the degradation of water-related ecosystems, and wasteful use of already developed water supplies. This article discusses the role of water for agriculture and food security, the challenges facing irrigated agriculture, and the range of policies, institutions, and investments needed to secure adequate access to water for food today and in the future.

TI  - Irrigation projects in Ethiopia: what can be done to enhance effectiveness under ‘challenging contexts’?
PY  - 2015
AB  - Investment in small scale irrigation (SSI) is crucial to sustain food security and livelihoods of smallholders. In Ethiopia, the government and development partners show a growing interest in developing irrigation projects. The success of irrigation projects is determined by governance and socio-cultural contexts. Yet the lack of thorough understanding of the challenging contexts undermines the efforts to achieve sustainability outcomes in irrigation projects. This article identifies the challenging contexts to irrigation projects, examines how the challenging contexts influence the effectiveness of irrigation projects, and indicates ways of improving the effectiveness of irrigation projects under the existing challenging contexts. Data were collected between April and December 2011 in three regional states of Ethiopia using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The lack of governance capacity and accountability are critical challenges for the sustainability of the irrigation projects. In addit...

TI  - Farmers’ Perception on Irrigation Farming and the Factors Influencing Access to and Size of Irrigable lands in Northern Region, Ghana
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:p>Aim: The impacts of climate change and variability requires proactive and reactive adaptation. The high reliance of farmers on rainfed agriculture leads to their high vulnerability to climate change. As an agrarian economy, irrigation farming system is an essential proactive and/or reactive strategy for the increasing erratic rainfalls in Northern Ghana. This study analyzed the perceptions of smallholder farmers on irrigation farming and the factors that influence access to and size of irrigable lands among communities in the catchment of two irrigation dams.&#x0D; Study Design: The study adopted a multi-stage sampling procedure.&#x0D; Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in the Northern Region of Ghana. The data for the study was collected in 2014.&#x0D; Methodology: Through a multi-stage sampling, a cross-sectional data was collected from 240 smallholder farmers. These included both irrigation farmers and non-irrigation farmers. The data was analyzed through switching regression and descriptive statistics.&#x0D; Results: The result revealed that water unavailability is not a major challenge to most irrigation farmers. The farmers engaged in irrigation vegetable farming mostly for cash purpose and also perceived a high demand for vegetables, especially in the dry season. From the farmers perception, group membership, distance to irrigable land, cost of irrigable land, leadership characteristics and nativity significantly influenced access to irrigable lands. From the econometric result, experience, farmer group, credit, extension, labour availability and age had significant influence on irrigation farming while education, experience, extension, sex and labour availability significantly influenced the acreage cultivated by the vegetable farmers.&#x0D; Conclusion: The study concluded that, while there is high market potential for irrigated produce, access to and the size of irrigable lands are significantly determined by a mixed of factors. Therefore, while farmers are encouraged to go into irrigation vegetable production, government’s policies such as ‘one village one dam’ should be effectively implemented to realize the needed results.</jats:p>

TI  - Nutritional Security of Pre-school Children from Irrigators and Non-irrigators Households in Turkana County, Kenya
PY  - 2019
AB  - Turkana County is a region of soils of high agricultural potential but aridity hinders its exploitation. It is characterized by scarce, erratic rainfall patterns. Food security remains a challenge in Turkana County despite its potential. Malnutrition resulting from food insecurity is the major concern in Turkana County. Turkana County prevalence of global acute malnutrition has remained high above the World Health Organization (WHO) threshold that is 27.3%. The study was guided by sustainable development goals, the goal number two which talks about end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable development and goal number three which talks about ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Malnutrition has been and continues to be responsible for over 60% of child mortality and therefore reduction of malnutrition is one of key ways of reducing child mortality. The current study investigated the contribution of small-scale irrigation interventions on nutrition status of pre-school children in Turkana County. Study objectives were; to evaluate nutrition status of pre-school children using anthropometry measurements among households practicing irrigation and those not practicing and establish the relationship. Cross-sectional, comparative and evaluation designs were used. Purposive and cluster sampling was done. Sample size was 420 (210 households practicing irrigation and 210 not practicing). A total of 845 children below 5 years were studied. The nutrition status of the pre-school children was poor across households practicing irrigation and those not practicing irrigation. The Chi square test of independence on the weight for age status for children below five years gave X 2 2, 0.05 = 90.439. This shows that there was highly significant (p<0.01) association between the weight for age for children below five years and the irrigation status of the household. A test of deviation to analyze weight for age for children below five years across households doing irrigation indicated that there was significant (p<0.05) difference with X 2 1, 0.05 = 9.167. The Chi square test of independence on the prevalence of weight for height for children below five years gave X 2 3, 0.05 = 21.798. This shows that there was significant (p<0.05) association between the weight for height for children below five years and the irrigation status of the household. Non-food strategies may be needed to complement dietary practices to manage the malnutrition situation in Turkana County

TI  - The impact of a small-scale irrigation scheme on malaria transmission in Ziway area, Central Ethiopia
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary Objective To assess the impact of a small-scale irrigation scheme in Ziway area, a semi-arid area in the Central Ethiopian Rift Valley, on malaria transmission. Method Parasitological, entomological and socio-economic studies were conducted in a village with and a village without irrigation. Blood smear samples were taken from individuals during the dry and wet seasons of 2005/2006. Socio-economic data were collected from household heads and key agricultural and health informants through interviews and questionnaires. Larval and adult mosquitoes were sampled during the dry and short wet seasons of 2006. Female anopheline mosquitoes were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for blood meal sources and sporozoite infections. Results Malaria prevalence was higher in the irrigated village (19%, P < 0.05) than the non-irrigated village (16%). In the irrigated village, malaria prevalence was higher in the dry season than in the wet season while the reverse occurred in the non-irrigated village. Households with access to irrigation had larger farm land sizes and higher incomes, but also higher prevalence of malaria. Larval and adult abundance of the malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles pharoensis, was higher in the irrigated than in the non-irrigated village throughout the study period. Furthermore, the abundance of An. pharoensis was significantly higher than that of An. arabiensis during the dry irrigated period of the year. Canal leakage pools, irrigated fields and irrigation canals were the major breeding habitats of the two vector mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates of 1.18% and 0.66% were determined for An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis in the irrigated village. Peak biting activities of the vectors occurred before 22:00 h, which is a source of concern that the effectiveness of ITNs may be compromised as the mosquitoes feed on blood before people go to bed. Conclusion Irrigation schemes along the Ethiopian Rift Valley may intensify malaria by increasing the level of prevalence during the dry season. To reduce the intensity of malaria transmission in the small-scale irrigation schemes currently in operation in Ethiopia, year-round source reduction by using proper irrigation water management, coupled with health education, needs to be incorporated into the existing malaria control strategies. Objectif: Evaluer l’impact d’un regime d’irrigation a petite echelle dans la region de Ziway, une zone semi-aride dans la vallee du Rift dans le centre de l’Ethiopie, sur la transmission de la malaria. Methode: Des etudes parasitologiques, entomologiques et socio-economiques ont ete conduites dans un village avec et un village sans irrigation. Des frottis d’echantillons de sang ont ete obtenus des personnes pendant les saisons seches et humides de 2005/2006. Les donnees socio-economiques ont ete recueillies aupres des chefs de menage et des informateurs cles agricoles et de la sante au moyen d’interviews et de questionnaires. Des larves et des moustiques adultes ont eteechantillonnes au cours de la saison seche et de la courte saison humide de 2006. Les moustiques anopheles femelles ont ete testes par ELISA pour les sources d’origine du sang et pour les infections a sporozoaires. Resultats: La prevalence de la malaria etait plus elevee dans le village irrigue (19,2%; P < 0,05) que dans le village non-irrigue (16,0%). Dans le village irrigue, la prevalence de la malaria etait plus elevee pendant la saison seche que pendant la saison des pluies alors que l’inverse etait observe dans le village non-irrigue. Les menages ayant acces a l’irrigation avaient des terrains agricoles de plus grandes tailles et des revenus plus eleves, mais aussi une plus forte prevalence de malaria. Une abondance de larves et d’adultes des vecteurs de la malaria, An. arabiensis et An. pharoensisetait plus elevee dans le village irrigue que dans le non-irrigue tout au long de la periode etudiee. En outre, l’abondance d’An. pharoensisetait significativement plus elevee que celle d’An. arabiensis durant la periode seche irriguee de l’annee. Les canaux de fuites des bassins, les champs irrigues et les canaux d’irrigation etaient les principaux habitats de reproduction des deux moustiques vecteurs. Des taux d’infection a sporozoites de P. falciparum de 1,18% et 0,66% ont ete determines pour An. arabiensis et An. pharoensis dans le village irrigue. Le pic des activites de piqure des vecteurs a eu lieu avant 22h00, ce qui est une source de preoccupation que l’efficacite des moustiquaires a insecticide pourrait etre compromise car les moustiques se nourrissent de sang avant l’heure de coucher des gens. Conclusion: Les systemes d’irrigation dans la vallee du Rift ethiopien pourraient intensifier la malaria en augmentant le niveau de prevalence au cours de la saison seche. Afin de reduire l’intensite de la transmission de la malaria dans les petits systemes d’irrigation a petite echelle actuellement en operation en Ethiopie, une reduction des sources tout au long de l’annee par l’utilisation d’une gestion appropriee des eaux d’irrigation, associee a l’education sanitaire, doit etre integree dans les strategies existantes de lutte contre la malaria. Objetivo: Evaluar el impacto sobre la transmision de malaria de un esquema de irrigacion a pequena escala en el area de Ziway, un area semi-arida del Gran Valle del Rift de Etiopia Central. Metodo: Se realizaron estudios parasitologicos, entomologicos y socio-economicos en un poblado con y un poblado sin irrigacion. Durante las estaciones seca y lluviosa del 2005/2006 se tomaron muestras de sangre para laminas de los individuos del estudio. Mediante entrevistas y cuestionarios a los cabeza de familia e informantes clave agricultores y sanitarios, se recolectaron los datos socio-economicos. Se muestrearon mosquitos adultos y larvas durante las estaciones seca y lluviosa del 2006. Los mosquitos anofelinos hembra fueron testados mediante un ensayo ELISA para fuentes de comida e infecciones por esporozoitos. Resultados: La prevalencia de malaria era mas alta en el poblado con irrigacion (19.2%, P < 0.05) que en el no irrigado (16.0%). En el poblado con irrigacion la prevalencia de malaria era mas alta en la estacion seca que en la lluviosa, mientras que lo contrario ocurria en el poblado no irrigado. Los hogares con acceso a irrigacion tenian terrenos cultivables mas grandes y mayores ingresos, pero tambien una mayor prevalencia de malaria. La abundancia de larvas y adultos de los vectores de malaria, An. arabiensis y An. pharoensis fue mayor en el poblado irrigado que en el no irrigado durante todo el periodo de estudio. Mas aun, la abundancia de An. pharoensis era significativamente mayor que la de An. arabiensis durante el periodo seco e irrigado del ano. Las piscinas de drenaje de los canales, los campos irrigados y los canales de irrigacion fueron los principales habitats de reproduccion de los dos mosquitos vectores. Las tasas de infeccion de esporozoitos de P. falciparum de 1.18 y 0.66% se determinaron para An. arabiensis y An. pharoensis en el poblado irrigado. Los picos de actividad de mordedura de los vectores ocurria antes de las 22:00 horas, siendo una fuente de preocupacion ya que la efectividad de las mosquiteras puede estar comprometida puesto que los mosquitos se alimentan de sangre antes de que las personas se vayan a la cama. Conclusion: Los esquemas de irrigacion a lo largo del Valle de Rift Etiope podrian intensificar la malaria al aumentar los niveles de prevalencia durante la estacion seca. Con el fin de reducir la intensidad de la transmision de malaria en los esquemas de irrigacion a pequena escala en operacion en Etiopia, se requiere incorporar a las estrategias de control de la malaria ya existentes, una reduccion de las fuentes durante todo el ano manejando adecuadamente la irrigacion apropiada, junto con una educacion sanitaria.

TI  - Who benefits from irrigation development in India? Implication of irrigation multipliers for irrigation financing
PY  - 2007
AB  - Who benefits from irrigation development and who should pay the cost? To answer this question we need to know, in addition to the information on farmers' level benefits, the total irrigation benefits derived by the farm and non-farm sectors in the economy. This question is not well addressed in the literature, therefore, we have estimated both direct benefits (farm-level benefits) and total benefits (rural economy-wide benefits) of irrigation in India. Then we compute irrigation multiplier values, which range from 3 to 4.5. This suggests that about two-thirds or more of the benefits from irrigation development have been accrued to the non-farm sector in the Indian economy, a factor that should be considered in developing a rational cost recovery and irrigation financing policy. But so far the discussions on irrigation financing are mostly farmer-centric, neglecting the total benefits and the semi-public good characteristics of irrigation systems. The empirical information on irrigation multipliers derived here has large implications for public policies such as poverty alleviation and food security in the tropics, where rural livelihoods still largely rely on the productivity and performance of irrigated agriculture. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Qui beneficie du developpement de l'irrigation en Inde et qui en supporte les couts? Pour repondre a cette question il nous faut analyser non seulement les benefices au niveau des exploitants agricoles mais aussi l'ampleur de tous les benefices derives de l'irrigation, tant agricoles que non-agricoles. Cette question est insuffisamment traitee dans la litterature et nous avons estime ici les benefices marginaux a la fois directs (au niveau du paysan) et indirects (economie rurale nationale). Nous en deduisons que les coefficients multiplicateurs en Inde varient entre 3.5 et 4. Ceci signifie que plus des deux tiers des benefices de l'irrigation ont beneficie a d'autres acteurs que les producteurs, un resultat qu'il s'agit de considerer quand on elabore des politiques de taxation, recouvrement ou de financement de l'irrigation. Bien que les analyses se concentrent le plus souvent sur la valeur ajoutee au niveau du producteur, il est essentiel de considerer les dimensions economiques distributives et leurs cruciales implications quant a la mise au point de politiques portant sur la securite alimentaire ou la reduction de la pauvrete sous les tropiques.

TI  - Impact Analysis of Taung Irrigation Scheme on Household Welfare among Farmers in North-west Province, South Africa
PY  - 2011
AB  - The study examines the impact of Taung irrigation scheme on the household welfare among farmers in the North West Province. Irrigation farming is one of the most important rural development investment strategies that can have both direct and indirect impact on poverty and food security. The sampling frame of the study consists of 137 farmers and a sample of sixty farmers was selected for the study. The relationship between the household welfare and the independent variables were estimated using an ordinary least square regression estimation procedure. The dependent variable used to capture household welfare is per capita expenditure. Per capita expenditure is used as a proxy for per capita income and employed as a measure of welfare. The results of the multiple regression analysis shows that the independent variables relate significantly to knowledge levels of the extension officers with an (=2.25, p<.05) an R (.67). The significant determinants of household welfare amongst farmers were age (t=1.78), gender (t=1.76), educational level (t=2.48), household head type (t=1.87), access to natural capital (t=-1.95) and socio-economic status (t=2.47).

TI  - Poverty reduction through water interventions: A review of approaches in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia
PY  - 2022
AB  - Water is a key factor in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of poverty elimination and hunger eradication. The regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA) are stricken with absolute poverty, with 70% of the world's poor. These regions are mainly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Diverse rural livelihoods in SSA and SA demand water interventions with more fruitful and effective outcomes in terms of poverty reduction. Existing water resources are not yet fully exploited in SSA and SA as these regions have a significant potential of 43 and 169 million ha, respectively, for irrigated agriculture through various water interventions. Various water interventions to alleviate poverty through better agricultural productivity across SSA and SA have been identified in this study. Major water intervention options identified include actions to: improve rain water management in rain-fed agriculture, facilitate community-based small-scale irrigation schemes, development and management of groundwater irrigation, interventions to upgrade and modernize existing irrigation systems, facilitate and improve livestock production and promote multiple uses of water. Investment in these water interventions will certainly help to break the poverty trap across diverse rural communities of SSA and SA. L'eau est un facteur clé pour atteindre les objectifs de développement durable (ODD) de l'élimination de la pauvreté et de l'éradication de la faim. Les régions de l'Afrique subsaharienne (ASS) et de l'Asie du sud (AS) sont frappées par la pauvreté absolue, ayant 70% des pauvres du monde. Ces régions dépendent essentiellement de l'agriculture pour leur subsistance. La diversité des moyens de subsistance ruraux en Afrique subsaharienne et en Asie du sud exige des interventions dans le domaine de l'eau pour avoir des résultats plus fructueux et plus efficaces en ce qui concerne la réduction de la pauvreté. Les ressources en eau existantes ne sont pas encore pleinement exploitées en Afrique subsaharienne et en Asie du sud, ces régions ayant un potentiel significatif de 43 et 169 millions d'hectares respectivement de l'agriculture irriguée grâce à diverses interventions dans le domaine de l'eau. Diverses interventions dans le domaine de l'eau visant à réduire la pauvreté par une meilleure productivité agricole en Afrique subsaharienne et en Asie du sud ont été identifiées dans cette étude. Les principales options d'intervention dans l'eau identifiées comprennent des actions visant à: Améliorer la gestion des eaux pluviales dans l'agriculture pluviale, faciliter les projets communautaires d'irrigation à petite échelle, développer et gérer l'irrigation des eaux souterraines, faciliter les interventions pour améliorer et moderniser les systèmes d'irrigation existants, faciliter et améliorer la production de bétail et animaux de basse-cour et promouvoir les utilisations multiples de l'eau. Les investissements dans ces interventions dans le domaine de l'eau contribueront certainement à briser le cycle de la pauvreté des diverses communautés rurales de l'Afrique subsaharienne et de l'Asie du sud.

TI  - Irrigation access and per capita consumption expenditure in farm households: Evidence from Ghana
PY  - 2012
AB  - Investment in agricultural water management has been one key poverty reduction strategy in developing countries. In Ghana, irrigation development for livelihood support, which dates back to the 1960s manifested in the development of formal irrigation infrastructure, starting with the rural savannah and coastal regions. This study applied a propensity score matching (PSM) approach and regression analysis (ordinary least squares and switching regression) to ascertain that, pro-poor irrigation investment in the rural savannah region of Ghana is justified due to significant irrigation contribution to consumption expenditure per capita in farm households. The results also show differences in the impacts of irrigation access on household consumption expenditure per capita due to differences in the methodologies employed. The gain in household consumption expenditure per (GH¢) using the different methodologies are as follows: Propensity Score Matching approach (GH¢ 24.90, GH¢28.30), ordinary least squares regression (GH¢ 5.40), and switching regression (GH¢23.70). Thus, the range of estimates of irrigation’s impact on household consumption expenditure is positive (GH¢ 5.4 to GH¢ 28.3). The differences in the magnitude of these estimates are ascribed to the underlying assumptions and robustness of each of these methodologies employed in the study. Key words: Irrigation, consumption expenditure, propensity score matching, ordinary least squares regression, switching regression, Ghana.

TI  - Policy processes and collective action in water reforms: the cases of Nicaragua and Suriname
PY  - 2014
AB  - Las reformas de agua en paises en desarrollo suelen llevarse a cabo junto con cambios institucionales mas profundos o, incluso, acompanadas de cambios constitucionales o de regimen politico. Por lo tanto, los marcos institucionales adaptados a paises gobernados sujetos al estado de derecho pueden no ser apropiados para contextos gobernados fundamentalmente, al menos en sus inicios, por instituciones informales o poco maduras. Esta tesis toma las reformas de agua como punto de partida y pretende contribuir a la literatura mediante una serie de analisis empiricos tanto del ambito general como del plano individual o sujeto personal de la politica del agua. En el ambito general, el foco se pone en los factores que explican el fallo de la accion colectiva en dos contextos diferentes: 1) en la implementacion de la nueva Ley de Aguas de Nicaragua y 2) en el mantenimiento y revitalizacion de las instituciones de riego en Surinam. En el plano del individuo, la investigacion se centra en las decisiones de los usuarios de los recursos y analiza el papel critico de las variables sociales para la gestion de los recursos comunes. Para ello, el metodo de investigacion utilizado es mixto, combinando el analisis de entrevistas, encuestas y experimentos. En el ambito general, los resultados muestran que las principales barreras para la implementacion de la nueva Ley de Aguas de Nicaragua podrian tener su reflejo en el lenguaje de la Ley y, por tanto, en la forma en la que se definen y configuran las instituciones incluidas en dicha Ley. Asi, la investigacion demuestra que la implementacion de politicas no puede ser estudiada o entendida sin tener en cuenta tanto el diseno de la propia politica como el marco socio-ecologico en el que se enmarca. El contexto especifico de Nicaragua remarca la importancia de considerar tanto las instituciones formales como informales en los procesos de transicion politica. A pesar de que las reformas de agua requieren plazos largos para su implementacion, el hecho de que exista una diferencia entre las reglas tal cual se definen formalmente y las reglas que operan en la realidad merece una mayor consideracion en el diseno de politicas basadas fundamentalmente en instituciones formales. En el ambito de la conducta individual, el analisis de la accion colectiva ofrece una serie de observaciones empiricas interesantes. En el caso de Nicaragua, los resultados indican que la intensidad de las relaciones sociales, el tipo de agentes dispuestos a proporcionar apoyo social y el nivel de confianza en la comunidad son factores que explican de manera significativa la participacion en la comunidad. Sin embargo, el hecho de que la gestion colectiva de riego se produzca, en la mayoria de casos, en torno a lazos familiares sugiere que las variables de capital social criticas se definen en gran medida en la esfera familiar, siendo dificil que se extiendan fuera de estos nexos. El analisis experimental de los resultados de un juego de uso de recurso comun y contribucion al bien publico muestra que las preferencias pro-sociales de los individuos y la heterogeneidad del grupo en terminos de composicion por sexo son factores que explican significativamente los resultados y las decisiones de apropiacion a lo largo del juego. En terminos del diseno de las politicas, es fundamental tener en cuenta las dinamicas de participacion y uso de los recursos comunes de manera que los niveles de cooperacion puedan mantenerse en el largo plazo, lo cual, como se observa en el caso de Surinam, no es siempre posible. Finalmente, el caso de Surinam es un ejemplo ilustrativo de los procesos de accion colectiva en economias en transicion. El analisis del fallo de la accion colectiva en Surinam muestra que los procesos politicos vinculados al periodo colonial y de independencia explican en gran medida la falta de claridad en las reglas operacionales y colectivas que gobiernan la gestion de los sistemas de riego y drenaje. Los resultados empiricos sugieren que a pesar de que la accion colectiva para la provision de los servicios de riego y drenaje estaba bien establecida bajo el regimen colonial, la auto-organizacion no prospero en un contexto dependiente del apoyo externo y regido fundamentalmente por reglas disenadas al nivel competencial del gobierno central. El sistema socio-ecologico que se desarrollo durante la transicion post-colonial favorecio, asi, la emergencia de comportamientos oportunistas, y posteriormente la inoperancia de los Water Boards (WBs) creados en la epoca colonial. En este sentido, cualquier intento por revitalizar los WBs y fomentar el desarrollo de la auto-organizacion de los usuarios necesitara abordar los problemas relacionados con los patrones demograficos, incluyendo la distribucion de la tierra, el diseno de instituciones y la falta de confianza en el gobierno, ademas de las inversiones tipicas en infraestructura y sistemas de informacion hidrologicos. El liderazgo del gobierno, aportando empuje de arriba-abajo, es, ademas, otro elemento imprescindible en Surinam. ABSTRACT Water reforms in developing countries take place along deeper institutional and even constitutional. Therefore, institutional frameworks that might result in positive outcomes in countries governed by the rule of law might not fit in contexts governed mainly by informal or immature institutions. This thesis takes water reforms as the starting point and aims to contribute to the literature by presenting several conceptual and empirical analyses at both general and individual levels. At the general national level, the focus is on the factors explaining failure of collective action in two different settings: 1) in the implementation of the new Nicaraguan Water Law and 2) in sustaining and revitalizing irrigation institutions in Suriname. At the individual level, the research focuses on the actions of resource users and analyzes the critical role of social variables for common pool resources management. For this purpose, the research presented in this thesis makes use of a mixed-method approach, combining interviews, surveys and experimental methods. Overall, the results show that major barriers for the implementation of the new Nicaraguan Water Law have its reflection on the language of the Law and, therefore, on the way institutions are defined and configured. In this sense, our study shows that implementation cannot fruitfully be studied and understood without taking into account both the policy design and the social-ecological context in which it is framed. The specific setting of Nicaragua highlights the relevance of considering both formal and informal institutions when promoting policy transitions. Despite the unquestionable fact that water reforms implementation needs long periods of time, there is still a gap between the rules on paper and the rules on the ground that deserves further attention when proposing policy changes on the basis of formal institutions. At the level of the individual agent, the analysis of collective action provides a number of interesting empirical insights. In the case of Nicaragua, I found that the intensity of social networks, the type of agents willing to provide social support and the level of trust in the community are all significant factors in explaining collective action at community level. However, the fact that most collective irrigation relies on family ties suggests that critical social capital variables might be defined within the family sphere and making it difficult to go beyond it. Experimental research combining a common pool resource and a public good game in Nicaragua shows that individuals’ pro-social traits and group heterogeneity in terms of sex composition are significant variables in explaining efficiency outcomes and effort decisions along the game. Thus, with regard to policy design, it is fundamental to consider carefully the dynamics of agents' participation and use of common pool resources, for sustaining cooperation in the long term, which, as seen in the case and Surinam, is not always possible. The case of Suriname provides a rich setting for the analysis of collective action in transition economies. The analysis of decay of collective irrigation in Suriname shows that the lack of clear operational and collective choice rules appear to be rooted in deeper political processes that date back to the colonial period. The empirical findings suggest that despite collective action for the provision of irrigation and drainage services was well established during the colonial period, self-organization did not flourish in a context governed by colonial state-crafted rules and mostly dependent on external support. The social-ecological system developed during the post-colonial transition process favored the emergence of opportunistic behavior. In this respect, any attempt to revitalize WBs and support self-organization will need to tackle the problems derived from demographic patterns, including land allocation, institutions design and government distrust, in addition to the typical investments in both physical infrastructure and hydrological information systems. The leadership role of the government, acting as a top-down trigger, is another essential element in Suriname.

TI  - Volatility spillover between water, energy and food.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Water, energy, and food and are strongly interconnected, and the sustainability of the whole world depends on this link. The aim of this article is to analyze the volatility spillovers between indexes representing the financial component of this nexus. We use a multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model with daily data in which the water variable is proxy by equity index that represents the performance of the industry involved in water business both at the global and local levels. For the food and energy sectors, we use two sub-indexes of the S&P Goldman Sachs (GS)-Commodity Index. Our results highlight the existence of a financial nexus between water, energy, and food that was particularly exacerbated during 2008 crisis. Evidence therefore suggests the need to better investigate the policy options that can be used to reduce price volatility in a framework of the rising relevance of sustainability issues.

TI  - Small-scale irrigation and household income linkage: Evidence from Deder district, Ethiopia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Investment in irrigation development is an important strategy in reducing risks associated with rainfall variability and achieving food security. This study examines the link between small-scale irrigation and household income. It also presents inherent institutional challenges in water allocation and the unintended outcomes. It used cross-sectional data obtained using a sample of 150 respondents selected through multi-stage sampling techniques from Deder district in eastern Ethiopia in 2009/2010 cropping year. The data were analyzed using Heckman-two step econometric models. The probit estimation shows that sex of the household head, access to credit and extension services have significant positive effect whereas the financial constraints restrains participation in irrigation water utilization. The ordinary least square using household income as outcome variable reveals that credit access, livestock holdings and proportion of land allocated to irrigation have significant positive effect on household income. This indicates that the more land is allocated to irrigation the higher will be the income. Moreover, the study pointed out that local institutional failure was a more important challenge than hydrological factors in managing the irrigation system. This has a policy implication in terms of strengthening the institutional environment. Key words: Deder, irrigation, income, Heckman model, institutions.

TI  - Do differences in the scale of irrigation projects generate different impacts on poverty and production
PY  - 2010
AB  - This paper investigates differences in household production and consumption among small- and large-scale irrigators to assess whether the scale of an irrigation project increases household welfare in Mali. Much of the evidence of the impact of irrigation does not use counterfactual analysis to estimate such impact or distinguish between the scale of the irrigation projects to be evaluated. In the dataset collected by the author, both a large-scale irrigation project and small-scale projects are used to construct counterfactual groups. Propensity score matching is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for small and large irrigators relative to nonirrigators on agricultural production, agricultural income, and consumption per capita. Small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and agricultural income than large-scale irrigation, but large-scale irrigation has a larger effect on consumption per capita. This suggests that market integration and nonfarm externalities are important in realizing gains in agricultural surplus from irrigation.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

TI  - Evaluating the pathways from small-scale irrigation to dietary diversity: evidence from Ethiopia and Tanzania
PY  - 2018
AB  - Interventions that aim to increase water availability for agriculture hold great potential for improving nutrition through increasing food production, generating income, enhancing water access and sanitation and hygiene conditions, and through strengthening women’s empowerment. Yet there is scarce evidence on the linkages between small-scale irrigation and the pathways through which nutrition outcomes can be achieved. Using data from a cross-sectional household survey collected in Ethiopia and Tanzania, we explored the potential for small-scale irrigation to contribute to improved diets, and identify the pathways through which irrigation affects dietary diversity as measured by the Household Dietary Diversity Score. Unadjusted comparisons show that irrigating households in both countries produced more vegetables, fruits and cash crops, are less food insecure, have a higher value of production, and have higher production diversity and dietary diversity compared to non-irrigating households. Econometric results of a simultaneous equation (3SLS) model showed that irrigation leads to better household dietary diversity mainly through the pathway of increasing household incomes. However, these results are statistically significant only in the case of Ethiopia, and not in Tanzania. While irrigation increased production diversity in Ethiopia, the benefits of increased dietary diversity cannot be attributed to these changes in production after controlling for the effect of income. Other factors, such as gender of the household head and having off-farm income, also influence dietary diversity in Ethiopia. These findings suggest that the potential for irrigation to influence diets is highly context-specific. Understanding the particular pathways and entry points for nutrition-sensitive agriculture approaches could help to improve their benefits for nutrition.

TI  - Estimating the impact of agricultural technology on poverty reduction in rural Nigeria.
PY  - 2009
AB  - "It has often been argued that new agricultural technologies lead to poverty reduction. This paper argues that any changes in poverty situation attributed to those who adopt new agricultural technology (treatment group) without a counterfactual comparison of carefully selected nonadopters (control group) are likely to be questionable. The paper estimates the effects of new agricultural technology on poverty reduction by employing the “double difference” method on data collected in rural Nigeria. Seeing the agricultural technology–poverty linkage through the lenses of adopters and nonadopters of such new technology provides understanding of the relationship between agricultural technology and poverty. The paper finds that differences in poverty status between adopters and nonadopters of new agricultural technologies (a combination of tube wells and pumps) introduced in rural Nigeria in the late 1980s and early 1990s are alarmingly modest. The paper concludes that new agricultural technology would not expressly lead to poverty reduction in poor countries. The exact channels through which new agricultural technology impact poverty outcomes need to be further explored." from authors' abstract

TI  - Irrigated Agriculture in Malaysia and Vietnam: A Comparative Analysis of Water Governance Strategies
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Irrigated agriculture has the potential to ensure food security, contribute to sustainable management, and preserve freshwater resources. At the same time, it is connected to problems such as water scarcity, environmental degradation and pollution, and poverty. This so-called “wicked” nature is addressed by comparatively analysing the strategies used for water governance in irrigated agriculture. To highlight its cross-sectoral nature, the concept of cross-sectoral alignment is introduced based on three governance criteria. The Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia and Vietnam are used to compare strategies as their differing political systems may lead to varying strategies and can thus offer greater insight into regional water management practices. The analysis suggests that the governance strategies used for irrigated agriculture have many similarities but also distinct differences. In particular, the influence of ODA in Vietnam as well as the way farmers are included in water management stand out in regards to the differences. Similar, however, are organisational set-ups, sectoral fragmentation, and insufficient supply of participatory mechanisms as well as generally low alignment across all categories. In consideration of the global importance of water management practices, only the aligned management of freshwater resources can increase environmental health and food security in the long term.</jats:p>

TI  - Small-Scale Irrigation and Income Distribution in Ethiopia
PY  - 2006
AB  - Irrigation stimulates agricultural productivity and economic growth, but this may come at the cost of growing inequality. Using data at community and household level, this paper analyzes the distributional impacts of irrigation in Ethiopia. Regression analyses reveal the direct effects of irrigation on expenditures and labour demand, and the indirect effects of irrigation on food prices and expenditures of non-irrigation households. The results indicate that past development of irrigation stimulated growth without deepening inequality, and that irrigation decreased dependence on food-for-work programs. Thus, irrigation has played a positive role in the development of Ethiopia.

TI  - Exploring ways to increase public investments in agricultural water management and irrigation for improved agricultural productivity in Southern Africa
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper explores ways to increase public investments in agricultural water management and irrigation for improved agricultural productivity in Southern Africa, with a specific focus on Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. The analysis was based on a critical review of literature and assessment of the national agricultural investment plans and agricultural/water policies in the study countries. Despite the potential to improve agricultural productivity, irrigation does not currently play a significant role in Southern African agriculture. There have been efforts and formal commitments at the continental, regional and country levels to promote investments in agricultural water management and irrigation to improve and sustain agricultural productivity. However, despite these commitments, actual implementation has been a challenge and the first 5 years of national agricultural investment plans have passed or are now coming to an end without much progress having been made regarding actual investments. Lack of adequate resources and institutional capacity have been some of the challenges affecting implementation of the investment plans to meet commitments in sustainable land and water management. Overall, as countries plan for the second phase of the CAADP programme, there are opportunities to ensure that investments in agricultural water management and irrigation and complementary technologies are prioritised and allocated adequate resources for implementation.

TI  - Effects of environmental modification on the diversity and positivity of anopheline mosquito aquatic habitats at Arjo-Dedessa irrigation development site, Southwest Ethiopia.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is key to increase agricultural productivity and ensure food security in Africa. However, unintended negative public health impacts (e.g. malaria) of such environmental modification have been a challenge. This study assessed the diversity and distribution of breeding habitats of malaria vector mosquitoes around Arjo-Dedessa irrigation development site in Southwest Ethiopia. Anopheline mosquito larvae were surveyed from two agroecosystems, ‘irrigated’ and ‘non-irrigated’ areas during the dry (December 2017–February 2018) and wet (June 2018–August 2018) seasons. Mosquito habitat diversity and larval abundance were compared between the irrigated and non-irrigated areas. The association between anopheline mosquito larvae occurrence and environmental parameters was analysed using Pearson chi-square. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine primary parameters that influence the occurrence of anopheline larvae. Overall, 319 aquatic habitats were surveyed during the study period. Around 60% (n = 152) of the habitats were positive for anopheline mosquito larvae, of which 63.8% (n = 97) and 36.2% (n = 55) were from irrigated and non-irrigated areas, respectively. The number of anopheline positive habitats was two-fold higher in irrigated than non-irrigated areas. Anopheline larval abundance in the irrigated area was 16.6% higher than the non-irrigated area. Pearson’s chi-square analysis showed that season (χ2 = 63.122, df = 1, P < 0.001), agroecosystem (being irrigated or non-irrigated) (χ2 = 6.448, df = 1, P = 0.011), and turbidity (χ2 = 7.296, df = 2, P = 0.025) had a significant association with larval anopheline occurrence. The study showed a higher anopheline mosquito breeding habitat diversity, larval occurrence and abundance in the irrigated than non-irrigated areas in both dry and wet seasons. This indicates that irrigation development activities contribute to proliferation of suitable mosquito breeding habitats that could increase the risk of malaria transmission. Incorporating larval source management into routine malaria vector control strategies could help reduce mosquito population density and malaria transmission around irrigation schemes.

TI  - The impact of smallholder irrigation on household welfare: The case of Tugela Ferry irrigation scheme in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - The potential of smallholder irrigated agriculture to enhance food security and alleviate rural poverty has led the South African Government to prioritise and invest significantly in irrigation establishment, rehabilitation and revitalisation. The question addressed in this study pertains to the extent to which smallholder irrigation has been able to reduce poverty in the rural communities to justify this investment. Using a sample of 251 farmers, this study found that factors such as land size, perceived soil fertility, household size, and access to support services were significant predictors of irrigation participation. The results from the treatment effect model indicated that access to irrigation plays a positive role in the welfare of rural households, with irrigators spending about ZAR2 000 per adult equivalent on consumption more than the non-irrigators. The study, therefore, concluded that government investments in smallholder irrigation for poverty reduction are justified. The other factors that influenced household consumption were off-farm income, land size, livestock size, education level, family size and access to support services and infrastructure. The study recommends that investments in smallholder irrigation continue for poverty reduction, and that priority should also be on finding other feasible rural micro-projects and development initiatives to complement smallholder irrigation and significantly reduce rural poverty.

TI  - The Livelihoods Impacts of Irrigation in Western Africa: The Ghana Experience
PY  - 2021
AB  - Although agriculture remains the mainstay of the African economy, it is currently going through stress because of a multitude of factors including climate change. Thus, many countries in their efforts to transform their agricultural sectors are employing climate-smart initiatives including the provision of water harvesting technologies for irrigated crop production during the dry season. This paper examines the role of irrigation in the drive towards a transformation of smallholder agriculture in Africa. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews and individual questionnaires were employed for the data collection. The data were analyzed using the regression adjustment (RA) technique. The results indicate that irrigation has significant and positive impacts on farm incomes, employment, consumption, food security and non-farm businesses, all of which are necessary conditions for a successful transformation of smallholder agriculture in Africa. The impacts of irrigation on health and environmental sustainability are mixed—the positive being the ability of irrigators to pay for improved healthcare for their families and the negatives include the outbreak of waterborne diseases associated with irrigation water. Construction of irrigation facilities causes destruction to the environment but improves provisioning ecosystem services. It is generally concluded that access to irrigation is associated with higher farm incomes, employment, consumption, food security and engagement in non-farm business activities. The key policy implication of these findings is that African governments must formulate strategic policies that will accelerate investments in the provision of irrigation facilities to better promote the agenda to transform smallholder agriculture in the continent.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Hydro-Economic Decision Tool for Rejuvenating Community Irrigation Tanks in Rural India
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rising water scarcity in agriculture has been a major concern worldwide. As resource managers seek to address this issue, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has become a widely accepted sustainability paradigm. The purpose of this study is to evaluate restoration alternatives of irrigation tanks by applying multi-criteria and probabilistic benefit–cost analysis for a rural watershed in India. We incorporate the principles of local-IWRM, namely, hydrological balance, efficiency, equity, stakeholders’ involvement, and uncertainty. We use the mixed-method approach of data collection, including remotely sensed hydro-ecological data, walk-through field observations, focus groups, and household surveys. The study region produces a large percent of runoff water (i.e., about 67% of the total precipitation) which can be partially captured to sustain irrigation tanks. The majority of the tanks in the study area do possess moderate to high irrigation potential yet remain in poor conditions. A proposed lift irrigation scheme with a 75% or more increase in water availability could return from ₹ 1.23 to ₹ 1.73 on every Indian rupee (₹) invested, in addition to other socio-ecological benefits. The increase in water availability could lead to future crop area expansion, which comes with a high price tag. Therefore, using additional water on the existing crop area can be just as economically viable as water-induced crop expansion. A coordinated effort on the part of local agencies and water users is necessary for efficient and equitable use of incremental water that comes from any restoration efforts in the study area or elsewhere.

TI  - Contribution of Agricultural Infrastructure to Rural Development in the Republic of Korea
PY  - 2016
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyse the effects of large-scale agricultural infrastructure investment on rural development. Accordingly, we selected the Yeongsan River Basin Comprehensive Development Project (YRBCADP) as the case project and evaluated the impacts of YRBCADP on agricultural and regional development individually. In terms of agricultural development, YRBCADP has contributed to the increase of farmland area, agricultural productivity, and farm income. The farmland of the project area was increased about 3.5 times, from 43 000 ha in 1970 to 150 000 ha in 2010, and the average rice yield per area was 3.97 t ha-1 in 1973. In addition, YRBCADP has affected regional development positively, such as population, regional income, and transportation accessibility. The ratio of population decrease was 25.6% in the project area but was 41.8% in the no-project area. The local tax per capita in the project area increased from 123 to 1747 million won in the period 1991–2011. The tidal embankment in YRBCADP has shortened travel distance, thus transportation costs were also reduced. This study reviewed the various effects of YRBCARD on rural development, and these results might offer useful information for making decisions for large-scale agricultural infrastructure investment.

TI  - What role can small-scale irrigation play in promoting inclusive rural transformation? Evidence from smallholder rice farmers in the Philippines
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract We investigate how user-managed small-scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation. Cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the Philippines, finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy. We also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals. Based on these findings, we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries.

TI  - Reducing food insecurity through equitable investments in irrigation: The case of Niger
PY  - 2022
AB  - We use Niger as a case study to examine the relationship between irrigation and household food security controlling for the point of crop harvest sales. We use longitudinal household and agriculture data collected by the Living Standards Measurement Study. Using panel fixed effects, we find that irrigation was associated with a 10% decrease in food insecurity, a 9% increase in food consumption expenditure, and improved dietary diversity. Farmers using irrigation experienced higher cash incomes, sold a higher share of the harvest, and had higher crop revenues. Access to irrigation was also positively correlated with the consumption of nutritious food items such as fruits, vegetables, and meat products. Importantly, these effects were found for both farmers using irrigation that primarily sold their harvest locally to neighbors and village shops, as well as for farmers using irrigation who sold in bulk to regional or national traders. Results suggest that investing in irrigation can improve food security, even in areas with limited access to formal markets.

TI  - Rethinking irrigation modernisation: realising multiple objectives through the integration of fisheries
PY  - 2019
AB  - Irrigation has been, and will remain, instrumental in addressing water security (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6), food insecurity (SDG 2) and poverty (SDG 1) goals. However, the global context in which irrigation takes place is changing rapidly. A call for healthier and more sustainable food systems is placing new demands on how irrigation is developed and managed. Growing pressures from competing water uses in the domestic and industrial sectors, as well increasing environmental awareness, mean irrigation is increasingly called on to perform better, delivering acceptable returns on investment and simultaneously improving food security, rural livelihoods and nutrition, as well as supporting environmental conservation. Better integration of fisheries (including aquaculture) in irrigation planning, investment and management can contribute to the modernisation of irrigation and the achievement of the multiple objectives that it is called on to deliver. A framework illustrating how fisheries can be better integrated with irrigation, and how the two can complement each other across a range of scales, from scheme to catchment and, ultimately, national level, is presented.

TI  - Policy Note: Expanding Irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p> Policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa have placed considerable emphasis on expanding irrigated agriculture. This is in response to the subcontinent’s growing population pressure, coupled with production risks associated with declining and variable rainfall. Irrigation is viewed as an important strategy to improve food security and protect rural livelihoods, with small-scale irrigation identified as the preferred strategy. And yet, adoption of irrigation has been slow, and irrigation investments are often underutilized. Expanding irrigated agriculture through increases in cultivated area alone will not be sufficient for greater food security; land and water productivity of irrigated agriculture needs to be increased, and this may in fact help accelerate the adoption of irrigation. Shared irrigation investments among small farmers are going to be challenging to sustain as smallholder households diversify their livelihoods, and do not cultivate field crops every season. For individual irrigation technologies, many barriers exist in their adoption, especially the risks and ambiguities such as pestilence and borehole installation failures; and governments will have to invest significantly more than they currently do in research and extension efforts to ease these barriers. Finally, the expansion of irrigation, especially individual irrigation, will likely create environmental challenges such as aquifer depletion, water pollution, and soil degradation, which governments would also have to manage by coordinating the actions of individual smallholders. This paper identifies the kind of institutional infrastructure and policy support that African agriculture will need to have in place to expand irrigation beyond its current status. </jats:p>

TI  - The impact of Irrigation on Agricultural Productivity: Evidence from India
PY  - NA
AB  - Using plot level production data from a nation-wide survey in India, we study the impact of irrigation on crop productivity, land prices and cropping intensities. Our main identification strategy is based on a sufficient number of households cultivating multiple plots of different irrigation status. After household fixed effects and plot characteristics are controlled for, our estimations show that irrigation has a strong and significant impact on all these outcomes with the dominant effects on cropping intensities. We find quality of irrigation also matters. Our results provide support for continuing investments to improve access and quality of irrigation in India.

TI  - Farmers Perspectives towards the Rehabilitation of the Irrigation Schemes in Sekhukhune District of the Limpopo Province, South Africa
PY  - 2014
AB  - The revitalisation of small-holder irrigation schemesprogram (RESIS) is one of the major irrigation programs introduced by the government of South Africa to support small-holder farmers. However, contrary to expectations, most of the government supported irrigation schemes have failed to meet the expectations of both the government and farmers. The aim of the present study is to determine the perceived reasons for the failure of the irrigation schemes. The study also seek to determine the association between socio-economic characteristic of farmers and the perceived reasons for the failure of the irrigation schemes. Multinomial regression analysis was applied to analyse the factors influencingfarmers perspectives towards the Rehabilitation of the Irrigation Schemes in Sekhukhune District of the Limpopo Province, South Africa.The results of the study reviewed that economic, competition and socio-cultural factors were perceived as having a large influence on the success of the schemes.The findings recommended socio-economic characteristics to be considered when planning developmental projects directed to small-holder farmers.

TI  - Access to irrigation and the escape from poverty: Evidence from Northern Mali
PY  - 2008
AB  - "Significant changes in the agricultural sector in northern Mali suggest that irrigation has made a large contribution to welfare increases over the past eight years. Using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching, and matched difference in differences with a small panel, this study estimates the impact of access to irrigation on poverty, production, and nutrient intakes. The findings suggest that gains in agricultural production value do not transfer uniquely to household consumption. The paper tests two alternative hypotheses about the distribution of agricultural gains: (1) the gains in agricultural production induced by irrigation yield higher household savings, or (2) intra-village transfers from irrigators to non-irrigators contribute to informal social insurance. The paper provides evidence of both saving and sharing within villages as complimentary strategies for consuming gains in agricultural production. This finding suggests that estimating the effects of a program, relying solely on household consumption, may underestimate the welfare gains of irrigation investment by ignoring the household's savings and informal insurance network." from Author's Abstract

TI  - Economywide impacts of climate change on agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa
PY  - 2013
AB  - Two possible adaptation scenarios to climate change for Sub-Saharan Africa are analyzed under the SRES B2 scenario. The first scenario doubles the irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, compared to the baseline, but keeps total crop area constant. The second scenario increases both rainfed and irrigated crop yields by 25% for all Sub-Saharan African countries. The two adaptation scenarios are analyzed with IMPACT, a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model combined with a water simulation module, and with GTAP-W, a general equilibrium model including water resources. The methodology combines the advantages of a partial equilibrium approach, which considers detailed water-agriculture linkages, with a general equilibrium approach, which takes into account linkages between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors and includes a full treatment of factor markets. The efficacy of the two scenarios as adaptation measures to cope with climate change is discussed. Due to the limited initial irrigated area in the region, an increase in agricultural productivity achieves better outcomes than an expansion of irrigated area. Even though Sub-Saharan Africa is not a key contributor to global food production (rainfed, irrigated or total), both scenarios help lower world food prices, stimulating national and international food markets.

TI  - Do the Poor Benefit from Corporate Social Responsibility? A Theory-Based Impact Evaluation of Six Community-Based Water Projects in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2015
AB  - Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can work as an effective means towards minimising business risk and maintaining amicable relationships with diverse groups of stakeholders. While many studies have examined the impacts of CSR on firm value and customer perceptions, little is known about the effects of a philanthropic engagement of the private sector on external stakeholder groups, such as local communities in developing countries. This paper examines welfare effects of six community-based water supply projects that were supported by a thermal power plant in Sri Lanka as part of the company's CSR strategy. The implications of these CSR activities are analysed from the perspective of the project beneficiaries, the majority of them poor smallholder farmers. Household production and labour income functions are estimated from survey data to analyse two pathways through which the water projects affect the beneficiaries' lives. First, the households get individual access to water that allows for the irrigation of home gardens, increases land productivity and changes households' farm output and income (irrigation channel). Second, the projects have an indirect effect on households' income via a time channel, i.e. the effect that due to the individual water access the households save time as there is no need any more to fetch water from far away water bodies or wells. This allows for a reallocation of labour time for other productive income-generating activities. Despite the considerable costs that households have to bear for an individual water connection, the study finds a systematic, positive net income effect of the projects on the beneficiaries via both the irrigation and the time channel. Qualitative evidence supports these findings and also reveals additional positive, non-monetarised project impacts. As the water projects would not have been realised without the subsidiary financial support of the power plant, it is concluded that the company's CSR engagement is increasing the welfare of the beneficiary communities.

TI  - Asymptomatic and submicroscopic malaria infections in sugar cane and rice development areas of Ethiopia.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Background Water resource development projects such as dams and irrigation schemes have a positive impact on food security and poverty reduction but might result in increased prevalence of malaria. Methods Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the dry and wet seasons in irrigated and non-irrigated clusters of Arjo sugarcane and Gambella rice development areas of Ethiopia in 2019. A total of 4464 and 2176 blood samples were collected from Arjo and Gambella. A subset of 2244 microscopy negative blood samples were analyzed by PCR. Results Prevalence by microscopy was 2.0% (88/4464) in Arjo and 6.1% (133/2176) in Gambella. In Gambella, prevalence was significantly higher in irrigated clusters (10.4% vs 3.6%) than in non-irrigated clusters ( <i>p</i> < 0.001), but no difference was found in Arjo (2.0% vs 2.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.993). Level of education was an individual risk factors associated with infection in Arjo [AOR: 3.2; 95%CI (1.27-8.16)] and in Gambella [AOR: 1.7; 95%CI (1.06-2.82)]. While duration of stay in the area for < 6 months [AOR: 4.7; 95%CI (1.84-12.15)] and being a migrant worker [AOR: 4.7; 95%CI (3.01-7.17)] were risk factors in Gambella. Season [AOR: 15.9; 95%CI (6.01-42.04)], no ITN utilization [AOR: 22.3; 95%CI (7.74-64.34)] were risk factors in Arjo, and irrigation [AOR: 2.4; 95%CI (1.45-4.07)] and family size [AOR: 2.3; 95%CI (1.30-4.09)] risk factors in Gambella. Of the 1713 and 531 randomly selected smear negative samples from Arjo and Gambella and analyzed by PCR the presence of <i>Plasmodium</i> infection was 1.2% and 12.8%, respectively. <i>P. falciparum, P. vivax</i> , and <i>P. ovale</i> were identified by PCR in both sites. Conclusion Strengthening malaria surveillance and control in project development areas and proper health education for at-risk groups residing or working in such development corridors is needed.

TI  - Rainfall shocks and crop productivity in Zambia: Implication for agricultural water risk management
PY  - 2022
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of erratic rainfall and related water problems on agricultural productivity. The paper also aims to shed light on the conceptual importance of understanding the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks for choosing feasible agricultural water risk management strategies both at household and policy levels. To achieve these goals we develop a conceptual framework, use national representative data from Zambia’s crop estimates survey for 2017/2018 farming season, employ fixed effects regression approach, and find that dry spells, excessive floods, incidence of water logging are all detrimental to crop productivity. The crop-based equations also reveal the differential impacts of the rainfall shocks on different crops. Since the effect of water factors including dry spells, floods and water logging on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types, it is important for the Zambian government as well as other countries to take this into account when planning and implementing strategies for agricultural water risk management.

TI  - Effect of Adoption of Irrigation on Rice Yield in the Municipality of Malanville, Benin
PY  - 2017
AB  - The paper employed a Heckman selectivity model to determine factors influencing the adoption of irrigation and its effect on rice yield in Benin. Results from probit estimates indicate that farmer's age, gender, extension services, access to credit, market participation, distance to irrigation scheme, use of tractor and fertilizer are factors affecting the probability of irrigation adoption. Results from Heckman second stage estimates show that the adoption of irrigation contributes significantly to rice yield improvement by 57 per cent. For robustness checks of the estimated effect of adoption of irrigation, the propensity score matching method was used. The results indicate that the percentage increase in rice yield due to irrigation adoption varies between 55 per cent and 60 per cent. This confirms the finding of the Heckman estimates. Other variables explaining rice yield are education, extension services, access to credit, market participation, off farm income, use of tractor, labour, and fertilizer. These results imply that besides the adoption of irrigation the provision of complementary services are needed to achieve the objective of productivity improvement.

TI  - The impact of micro-irrigation on households’ welfare in the northern part of Ethiopia : an endogenous switching regression approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - The paper uses an endogenous switching regression model to measure the impact of participation in micro-irrigation development on households’ welfare. The model takes into account selection bias associated with programme participation and endogeneity problems often encountered in most programme evaluations. A total of 482 households (195 irrigation users and 287 non-users) were used to generate all the necessary variables. To capture the impact of the irrigation on household welfare, two indicators were consideredv namely household farm income (Y) and household fixed asset formation (F) (evaluated at market Price during the survey period). The results show a positive and significant impact of irrigation use on the two outcome variables: income by 8.8 per cent and asset formation by 186 per cent as compared to non-users. This shows how important the micro-irrigation schemes are in improving the welfare of poor farmers in the research areas. Furthermore, the empirical results show that the probability of using one of the water sources (irrigation scheme) is associated with farm experience (age as proxy), farmer-to-farmer contact (the existence of an irrigation user neighbour), family size, the state of credit constraint, the number of visits by extension agents and the cost of irrigation development. As a robustness check, different models were applied and results were found consistent, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TI  - Investment in irrigation as a poverty reduction strategy: analysis of small-scale irrigation impact on poverty in Tigray, Ethiopia
PY  - 2008
AB  - The regional government of Tigray has invested in millions of Birr to develop irrigation schemes as a strategy of poverty reduction. The study was based on a representative sample of 613 farm households (331 irrigators and 282 non-irrigators) drawn using three stage stratified sampling with probability proportional to size. The main aim of this paper is to study the impact of irrigation on household income, therefore, to contribute to the scant literature on irrigation-poverty reduction nexus in Ethiopia, which policy makers can use it as an input to make informed policy decisions in their future endeavors. We found that farming income is more important to irrigating households than to non-irrigating households, while off-farm income is negatively related with access to irrigation. We also found that irrigating households\u2019 average income is above the regional average, while non-irrigating households\u2019 average income is 50 percent less than the average income of irrigating households. Although there can be other factors, which may contribute to the difference in income, these results are in line with our expectation and supports the decision of the Tigray government to use irrigation as a poverty reduction tool. We have used a stochastic dominance analysis and found that the results are consistent. This result differs from a previous study by Pender et al. (2002), which argues that irrigation has less impact in agricultural yields than expected, reducing returns to investment in modern irrigation.

PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Water resource development practice such as irrigation is key to ensuring economic growth and food security in developing countries. However, unintended public health problems such as malaria linked to such development projects have been a concern. This study aimed to determine the impact of irrigation on malaria incidence and vector mosquito abundance in southern Ethiopia.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Eight years' malaria morbidity data were extracted from the medical registers of health facilities in both irrigated and non-irrigated settings.

TI  - Challenges Facing Leaders in Transforming Small-Scale Irrigation Farming in Usa River Ward, Arumeru District, Northern Tanzania
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>The low agricultural productivity of key crops and food insecurity continue to be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Tanzania in particular. The growing population and climate change further increase the food shortage. Irrigation has been strategized to reduce poverty and food insecurity, and improve the livelihoods of communities in African countries, and in particular Tanzania. Transformational leadership for small-scale irrigation is urgently needed to attain the planned agenda for irrigation schemes. This study assessed the challenges of leadership in leading and transforming small-scale irrigation schemes. The questionnaires were distributed to leaders of the agriculture sector in four strata (agriculture extension officer (25), AMCOS leaders (6), agriculture engineers (2), irrigation committee (9)) with a total of 42 leaders as participants. A total of 118 farmers were interviewed from four irrigation canals (Ngollo (32), Ngarasero I (32), Ngarasero II (33), and Abisinia (21)) in the Usa River ward. The study found that the challenges of leaders in leading the transformation of small-scale farming for success were commitment of leaders, market chain, pest control mechanisms, irrigation extension service, planning, technological transformation and adoption, mobilization of farmers and professionals, monitoring and evaluation, knowledge of irrigation, and agro-input supply. This study shows that leaders’ transformation skills can play a great role in poverty reduction in small-scale irrigation in the Usa River ward. Therefore, leaders in the study area should play the role of transformational leadership effectively in managing small-scale irrigation by practicing a participatory approach to farmers problem-solving.</jats:p>

TI  - Anopheles Species Composition and Breeding Habitat Characterisation in Chiredzi District, Zimbabwe
PY  - 2020
AB  - Malaria is a public health concern in Zimbabwe and its transmission varies geographically and seasonally, corresponding with the country's rainfall pattern. Information on density and distribution of malaria vectors, species composition, breeding sites and quality assurance of the spray programme is limited for Chiredzi District. This study investigated mosquito species composition and distribution during winter, blood meal sources of adult collections, characteristics of aquatic larval habitats and quality of spraying as well as the insecticide residual activity on sprayed walls. Anopheline larvae were collected from breeding habitats that were subsequently characterised. Adult anophelines were sampled from both inside human dwellings and outdoors. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically and further processed to sibling species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where necessary. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite proteins and multiplex PCR was used to detect blood meal source. WHO cone bioassays were conducted to monitor spray quality and insecticide residual activity on spayed walls. A total of 21 aquatic habitats were identified from which anopheline larvae were sampled. Of these, 9 (42.9 %) were classified as permanent, 7 (33.3 %) as seasonal and 5 (23.8 %) as temporal. Anopheles mosquitoes from both adult and larval collections totalled to 153, with the former collection method accounting for 69.9 % (107) and the latter for 31.1 % (46). The collected mosquitoes were identified as An. quadriannulatus and An. funestus respectively. Out of the blood-fed An. funestus females, 70 % (n = 10) had fed on human blood. None of the adult collected mosquitoes tested positive for P. falciparum circumsporozoite proteins. The aquatic habitats surveyed indicated that breeding sites were mainly man-made. Anopheles funestus was the only malaria vector recorded during this study. This species is a particularly efficient vector and its detection is a cause for concern. Furthermore, 70 % of the adult-collected An. funestus female specimens had fed on humans confirming this species' strong tendency toward anthropophagy. A more comprehensive and year-round investigation is essential to gather appropriate and relevant entomological indices on malaria transmission in Chiredzi so as to enable effective vector control.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF NDANDA TRADITIONAL IRRIGATION SCHEME ON CROP PRODUCTIVITY IN MASASI DISTRICT
PY  - 2013
AB  - Small scale irrigation has immense potential to improve agricultural productivity and incomes of poor rural households. A survey of 150 randomly-selected household heads using semi-structured interviews was undertaken to assess the influence of irrigation on crop productivity. The specific objectives of the study were to; examine and compare the socio-economic factors that influence crop yield and income of irrigating and nonirrigating households; determine and compare area cultivated, crop yield and household income of irrigating and non-irrigating households; estimate the benefits of irrigation water on agricultural crops in Ndanda traditional scheme and identify constraints affecting farmers in the study area. The results show that irrigating households were better off compared to non irrigating households in many aspects related to crop yield, income and had higher benefits. The regression results show that irrigation is an important determinant for crop yield and household income. The Heckman’s two-stage estimation was used to estimate determinants of Ndanda traditional small scale irrigation participation and household income and it was revealed that age, sex, and education level, size of cultivated land, agricultural inputs; access to extension services and access to credit were important determinants for participating in small scale irrigation schemes. The analysis further revealed that irrigation participation, age and size of cultivated land are positively and significantly associated with household income at p< 0.05. The average annual net benefit from irrigation was Tshs 245 480 901. The constraints affecting crop yield identified by farmers include: poor infrastructure system, higher cost of production, inadequate improved varieties, inadequate farm machinery, inadequate marketing system and crop pests and diseases.

TI  - Assessment of Suitable Areas for Home Gardens for Irrigation Potential, Water Availability, and Water-Lifting Technologies
PY  - 2018
AB  - The study was conducted in Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia to assess potentially irrigable areas for home gardens, water availability, and feasibility of water-lifting technologies. A GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique was applied to access the potential of surface and groundwater sources for irrigation. The factors affecting irrigation practice were identified and feasibility of water-lifting technologies was evaluated. Pairwise method and expert’s opinion were used to assign weights for each factor. The result showed that about 345,000 ha and 135,000 ha of land were found suitable for irrigation from the surface and groundwater sources, respectively. The rivers could address about 1–1.2% of the irrigable land during dry season without water storage structure whereas groundwater could address about 2.2–2.4% of the irrigable land, both using conventional irrigation techniques. If the seven major dams within the basin were considered, surface water potential would be increased and satisfy about 21% of the irrigable land. If rainwater harvesting techniques were used, about 76% of the basin would be suitable for irrigation. The potential of surface and groundwater was evaluated with respect to water requirements of dominant crops in the region. On the other hand, rope pump and deep well piston hand pump were found with relatively the most (26%) and the least (9%) applicable low-cost water-lifting technologies in the basin.

TI  - Water implications of large-scale land acquisitions in Ghana.
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper examines the water dimensions of recent large-scale land acquisitions for biofuel production in the Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo and Northern regions of Ghana. Using secondary sources of data complemented by individual and group interviews, the paper reveals an almost universal lack of consideration of the implications of large-scale land deals for crop water requirements, the ecological functions of freshwater ecosystems and water rights of local smallholder farmers and other users. It documents the factors responsible for this apparent oversight including the multiplicity of land and water governance systems, sharp sectoral boundaries between land and water policies, property rights and institutions, outdated statutes, poorly resourced and ineffective regulatory agencies, and unequal power relations in land acquisition deals. The paper shows that due to a lack of an approach that jointly considers land and water management policies and institutions in acceding to large-scale land deals, the benefits derived by local people were insufficient to cover the involuntary permanent loss of their water rights and livelihoods and the risks posed to ecosystem services. Options for establishing alternative institutional arrangements that will allow water availability, use and management as well as social and environmental standards to be factored, ex ante, into large-scale land deals are

TI  - Food demand, uncertainty and investments in human capital : three essays on rural Andhra Pradesh, India
PY  - 2010
AB  - This dissertation provides some explanations of the causes of poverty in rural India, by investigating poverty determinants that are too often neglected in the literature and in policy debates. It proceeds in three main chapters, each addressing a specific research question. The first chapter focuses on the process of agricultural transformation in the state of Andhra Pradesh. In the early stages of economic development, all countries undergo a process of transformation of their production and employment structure. As a result, agricultural output as a share of total GDP decreases, as does rural employment as a share of total employment. Over the last 50 years, the share of agriculture in total output has considerably declined in Andhra Pradesh. However, the agricultural sector continues to employ the great majority of the labour force. The theoretical section of this chapter shows how structural change is affected by the characteristics of food demand and by income inequality. The empirical analysis, using novel semiparametric methods, estimates food Engel curves and food elasticities, which are used to simulate the effects on changes in income distribution on the composition of demand. The second chapter analyses the stabilising effect of irrigation on household expenditure. The expansion of irrigation infrastructure, together with the introduction of hybrid seeds and chemical fertilisers, was the most important technological advancement in Indian agriculture of the last 50 years. The positive impact of irrigation on income of rural households has been extensively documented, but its stabilising effect has been largely neglected. The first part of the chapter builds a theoretical model that establishes the causal links between access to irrigation, income stability, and consumption smoothing over the seasonal cycle. The empirical analysis assesses the stabilising impact of irrigation on expenditure using modern impact evaluation techniques. The findings indicate that consumption patterns of households with access to irrigation are more stable over the seasonal cycle and over the years. The third chapter studies the effect of income uncertainty on educational choices made by the rural poor. It investigates the demand side of education in order to understand why a large number of rural children do not enrol or complete primary education. The theoretical part of the chapter presents an inter-temporal consumption model that shows how the expectation of income variability negatively affects household expenditure on education. The empirical analysis uses a duration model with time covariates in order to estimate the determinants of child progress in school, and provides evidence that income variability negatively affects investments in education.

TI  - Farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in Benin: a stakeholder-consultation approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - AbstractThis article examines rice farmers’ perceptions of irrigation and constraints on rice production in the municipality of Malanville, Benin. Farmers’ positive perceptions of irrigation include the use of irrigation for insurance against drought, crop yield improvement, higher income, food security and poverty reduction. Analysis of constraints reveals that farmers face major constraints such as lack of agricultural credit, poor access to production inputs, inadequate knowledge of water resources management, poor access to agricultural information and markets, and flooding of fields. Specific constraints in the irrigation scheme of Malanville include the high cost of irrigation and unavailability of water.

TI  - Assessment of the Quality of Shallow Groundwater for Irrigation in the Atankwidi Sub-Basin of the White Volta Basin, Ghana
PY  - 2014
AB  - The potential use of shallow groundwater for small-scale dry season irrigation is a key issue for irrigation development in the arid zone of Ghana. Farmers within the Atankwidi sub-basin of the White Volta Basin are increasingly adopting groundwater as a source of irrigation water due to the unavailability of surface water during the dry season. However the quality of the groundwater and its suitability for irrigation is not known, hence the need to assess the quality and its suitability in order to ensure sustainability in the application and possible expansion of groundwater irrigation in the area. Two main water types (Ca-Mg-HCO 3 and Na-Mg-Ca-HCO 3 ) have been determined using the Piper diagram. The relative abundance of cations in the groundwater was found to be in the decreasing order of Na + > Ca 2+ > K + > Mg 2+ > Fe 2+ . Similarly, that of anions was found to have a decreasing order of HCO 3 - > SO 4 2- > Cl - > PO 4 2- > NO 3 - > F - . Groundwater in the area had low SAR and low to medium salinity hazard. However, magnesium hazard and alkalinity problems are likely to limit its use for irrigation. Keywords: Shallow Groundwater, Hydrochemical facies, Irrigation Water Quality.

TI  - Groundwater potential for dry-season irrigation in north-eastern Ghana
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper assesses the groundwater resource potential for dry-season vegetable irrigation in two areas of north-eastern Ghana. It uses multiple methods, including geophysical surveying, recharge estimation, and water quality analysis. Results indicate that groundwater abstractions for all purposes are small compared to recharge. The quality of groundwater in both study areas is suitable for irrigation, but a few wells had high nitrate levels for drinking water. There is a potential to expand dry-season irrigation with groundwater 14- to 18-fold in the study areas.

TI  - Water Balance and Soil Moisture Deficit of Different Vegetation Units under Semiarid Conditions in the Andes of Southern Ecuador
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water availability in semiarid regions is endangered, which is not only due to changing climate conditions, but also to anthropogenic land use changes. The present study analyzed the annual and monthly water balance (WBc) and the soil moisture deficit (Ds) for different vegetation units under semiarid conditions in the Andes of southern Ecuador, based on limited meteorological station data and field measurements (soil samples). To calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) the Blaney–Criddle method was applied, and the specific crop factor (Kc) included, because only temperature (T) and precipitation (P) data were available. By means of the soil samples the water retention capacity (RC) of the different soil types present in the study area were estimated, which, in combination with WBc, provided reliable results respective to water surpluses or deficits for the different vegetation units. The results indicated highest Ds for cultivated areas, particularly for corn and sugarcane plantations, where annual deficits up to −1377.5 mm ha−1 and monthly deficits up to −181.1 mm ha−1 were calculated. Natural vegetation cover (scrubland, forest and paramo), especially at higher elevations, did not show any deficit throughout the year (annual surpluses up to 1279.6 mm ha−1; monthly surpluses up to 280.1 mm ha−1). Hence, it could be concluded that the prevailing climate conditions in semiarid regions cannot provide the necessary water for agricultural practices, for which reason irrigation is required. The necessary water can be supplied by areas coved by natural vegetation, but these areas are endangered due to population growth and the associated land use changes.

TI  - Trend, Status, and Challenges of Irrigation Development in Ethiopia—A Review
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ethiopia’s food supply and economy in general is largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture. Hence, irrigation development is vital to minimize the risk of crop failure and sustain agricultural production. The purpose of this review was to collect published and unpublished information from relevant sources and then review and synthesize key information on the trends and status of irrigation development and challenges threatening its implementation and sustainability. Historically, traditional irrigation based on farmers’ own initiative and indigenous knowledge has been practiced in Ethiopia for over 2000 years. However, well-planned, government-funded medium and large-scale irrigation development started only three decades ago. Specifically, significant progresses have been registered during the implementation of two consecutive five-year plans, the “Growth and Transformation Plans”. Currently, the total area equipped for irrigation has reached some 3.07 million hectares. However, the actual area irrigated is lower than this figure. The challenges facing the irrigation sector are related to study and design, construction or implementation, irrigation management, and lack of other support services such as extension, input services, and market. While the expansion of irrigation is still important, the poor performances and operational management of existing irrigation schemes needs to be given equal attention. As many of the problems are related to capacity and capability limitations, there is an urgent need for institutional and capacity development for the irrigation sector.

TI  - Estimating the storage and maximum annual yield of the aquifer system in northern Ghana and the potential for irrigation
PY  - 2009
AB  - Journal of Environmental Hydrology Volume 17 Paper 19 September 2009 1 Despite the water scarcity for sustainable agricultural production for improved livelihood for a majority of the Africa population, not much effort has been put in the exploitation of groundwater for irrigation. This may be partially attributed to lack of information on the storage capacities of the aquifer systems. An attempt has been made to estimate the maximum storage and average annual yield of the aquifer system in northern Ghana as a guide for groundwater irrigation in the area. This area is one of the poorest regions of the country and suffers from perennial seven months of severe drought. Though there have been some recharge studies, it is not clear if the aquifer system has enough storage capacity to accommodate the 1.26x1010 m3/year as the volume of water reported in literature. Data from population, longterm time series data of precipitation and discharge from rivers were analyzed in this study. The results show that the maximum groundwater storage is 6.44x109 m3 with average maximum yield of 4.57x109 m3/year. Current groundwater abstraction trends show that there is enough groundwater to support irrigation provided careful management principles of the aquifer system are adhered to.

TI  - The determinants of small-scale irrigation practice and its contribution on household farm income: The case of Arba Minch Zuria Woreda, Southern Ethiopia
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study was conducted at Arba Minch Zuria Woreda. The area lacks in-depth studies to identify the determinant factors that influence the use of irrigation water. In the study area it is also not well known to what extent the households using irrigation water were better-off than those who depend on rain-fed agriculture. Therefore, the study was focused on assessing the determinants of small-scale irrigation practice and its contribution on household farm income. The total population in the selected three villages stratified in to two strata (irrigation user and non-user). Then systematic sampling method was employed to select the respondents’ household from the population frames of two strata. The descriptive statistics and the binary logistic regression analysis were used for analyzing quantitative data. The results show that sex of respondents’; household size engaged in the agricultural labor force and number of contact of respondents with agricultural development agents per month had significant positive effect on the use of irrigation water at 1% significance level. While education level and attendance on irrigation related training had significant positive effect on the use of irrigation water at 10% significance level. On the other hand, farm distance from the river and the main irrigation canal had significant negative effect on the use of irrigation water at 1% significance level. Out of the total Irrigation user respondents’ household (98.2) have harvested perennial crops more than two times and grown annual crops two times per year from the same farm. While out of the total irrigation non-user respondents’ household depended on only rain fed agriculture (90.7%) have grown annual crops only one time per year from the same farm. Consequently, the independent sample test result showed that the irrigation user respondents’ household obtained significantly larger mean annual gross farm income than irrigation non-user respondents’ household at 1% significance level. Key Words: Irrigation, income, t-test and logistic.

TI  - Importance of irrigated agriculture to the Ethiopian economy: Capturing the direct net benefits of irrigation
PY  - 2011
AB  - This study is an attempt to quantify the actual and expected contribution of irrigation to the Ethiopian economy for 2005/06 and 2009/10 cropping seasons using adjusted net gross margin analysis. After obtaining adjusted gross margin values for rain-fed and irrigation systems under different typologies, irrigation’s contribution was calculated to be about 5.7 and 2.5 percent to agricultural and overall GDP during the 2005/06 cropping season. By the year 2009/2010, irrigation’s contribution to agricultural and overall GDP is estimated to grow to about 9 and 3.7 percent, respectively. After relaxing some of the underlying assumptions, the future contribution of irrigation to agricultural GDP will rise to about 12 percent while the contribution to overall GDP will be about 4 percent. Recommendations for enhancing irrigation’s contribution and policy implications for cost recovery and sustainability of irrigation investment are drawn.

TI  - Water and Food Insecurity in Developing Countries:Major Challenges for the 21st Century
PY  - 2005
AB  - World population is projected to reach almost 8 billion people around the year 2025 (UN 1999). This expected increase has raised considerable debate about the world's ability to meet future food needs (Rosegrant et. al. 2001a; Scanes and Miranowski 2004). However, food is only one serious concern. The implications of a parallel, but related, growth in demand for water are profound and far-reaching. Already more than 1 billion people live without access to clean water, many of whom inhabit developing countries classified as 'water scarce'2. Yet the number of water-scarce countries is expected to rise to 30 by the year 2025, of which 21 will be low-income food-deficit countries home to 1.8 billion people (IWMI 2000). The task of ensuring adequate access to water will therefore be one of the most difficult challenges facing development professionals in the 21st century; at least as hard as ensuring food security.

TI  - Agua, agricultura y desarrollo: avances y retos para la reducción de la pobreza
PY  - NA
AB  - Agua y produccion agraria can indisolublemente unidas. El regadio permite aumentar y estabilizar las cosechas, mejorando las rentas de los hogares rurales. En las zonas mas pobres del mundo el regadio no se ha explotado de acuerdo al potencial productivo y los rucursos existences. El mundo tiene recursos suficientes para alimentarse, pero muchos paises veran aumentada su dependencia alimentaria del exterior debido a la escasez de recursos por habitante. La expansion del regadio en el mundo se ha ralentizado en los ultimos 20 anos. El regadio, como motor de desarrollo rural y vehiculo de reduccion de la pobreza, ha cobrado importancia tras la crisis alimentaria de 2007-2008, y el posterior encarecimiento de las materias primas agrarias. La gestion del aqua y de la tierra en las regiones mas pobres precisa tanto inversiones productivas como mejoras en la gobernanza y la participacion de la mujer. Este articulo analiza estas cuestiones y trata de identificar los retos mas acuciantes para 2011-2020.

TI  - Rural infrastructure and poverty in China.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The study develops a theoretical framework of how irrigation and drainage infrastructure and rural transportation infrastructure influence poverty. Using panel data on 31 provinces in China from 2002 to 2017, this paper estimates basic and continuous difference-in-differences (DID) models to investigate the preliminary impact of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and rural transportation infrastructure on poverty and further explores the influence mechanisms of these rural infrastructures on poverty by using the mediating effect model. The results show that irrigation and drainage facilities infrastructure can directly reduce poverty. On the one hand, rural transportation infrastructure directly leads to rural hollowing out and aggravates rural poverty; on the other hand, it indirectly promotes poverty reduction by stimulating economic growth. Overall, the positive and negative effects of rural transportation infrastructure on poverty offset each other.

TI  - RURAL POVERTY AND IRRIGATION PERFORMANCE IN ODISHA, INDIA
PY  - 2014
AB  - ABTRACT The inverse relationship between irrigation and rural poverty has been proved by various studies across world. However, irrigation variable has not been considered as independent variable to show the impact of irrigation on rural poverty reduction in districts level study in Odisha, India. Therefore, the missing links between irrigation and rural poverty have been analysed in this study. This study is based on secondary data. Both descriptive and regression analysis have been used for the study. Simple and multiple regressions have been used considering poverty as dependent variable, and irrigation and other selected poverty determinant variables as independent variables with time lag and without time lag for analysis. The results of the study demonstrate that irrigation influences in reducing rural poverty in districts of Odisha. It also pointed out that among the selected poverty determinants variables, irrigation is predominantly and significantly impacting on rural poverty alleviation across districts in Odisha. The important finding from the multiple regressions analysis is that irrigation impacts in alleviating rural poor better with time lag than without time lag. This shows that the impact of base level irrigation infrastructure on rural poverty reducing is highly recognized.

TI  - Irrigated Agriculture and Welfare: Panel Data Evidence from Southern Ghana
PY  - 2021
AB  - We present results on the drivers and impacts of household adoption of irrigated agriculture technologies on welfare in Southern Ghana. Using a panel data and a doubly robust estimator to account for selection bias, the estimates show statistically significant positive impacts on income, consumption, and proportions of in-transfers, out-transfers and savings with financial institutions. The impacts on the welfare indicators differ based on the adoption of alternative irrigated agriculture technologies. We also identify key factors influencing the adoption including extension visit, farmer based organization, ownership of agricultural land, access to water resources, among other community and household level characteristics. The findings show the importance of information, social capital and networks, and access to infrastructure in the adoption process of irrigation technologies in Southern Ghana. The results suggest that agricultural development, particularly irrigated agriculture technologies can contribute to improvements in the economic status of farm households in Southern Ghana.

TI  - Local warming and violent conflict in North and South Sudan
PY  - 2014
AB  - Our article contributes to the emerging micro-level strand of the literature on the link between local variations in weather shocks and conflicts by focusing on a pixel-level analysis for North and South Sudan between 1997 and 2009. Temperature anomalies are found to strongly affect the risk of conflict, whereas the risk is expected to magnify in a range of 24–31% in the future under a median scenario. Our analysis also sheds light on the competition over natural resources, in particular water, as the main driver of such relationship in a region where pastoralism constitutes the dominant livelihood.

TI  - Impact of water user associations on agricultural productivity in Chile.
PY  - 2009
AB  - "This article uses combined household- and community-level data collected from the Maule Region (VII) of Chile to evaluate factors affecting the decision to participate in yearly irrigation maintenance activities, and the influence of current behavior on farm revenues. Empirical results indicate that water user association characteristics explain much of the variation in participation decisions, contribution amounts, variable input purchases, and subsequent farm revenues." from authors' abstract
