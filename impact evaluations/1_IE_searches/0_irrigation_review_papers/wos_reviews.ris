AB  - This paper reviews the effects of irrigation on soil physical properties, particularly soil water movement and storage, under predominantly pastoral systems. Few studies address how irrigation impacts these in temperate climates, with very few studies under modern spray irrigation and intensive pastoral farming. Irrigation generally means intensive land use will occur. It is difficult to uncouple factors affecting physical conditions such nutrient cycling, land use, stock class, grazing management and animal treading. Irrigation (with associated increased land use intensity) tends to alter soil physical properties, changing them to be like soils formed under higher rainfall particularly in arid and semi-arid climates. Changes in physical properties under irrigation in temperate and sub-humid climates were more variable. Some studies showed increased available water capacity, while others showed no change. Knowledge gaps include effects of irrigation intensification on soil physical properties under modern farm systems to improve process, management, spatial and temporal information.

AB  - Applying irrigation get high production results and economics of investments in irrigation systems points out that this measure in agricultural production should be given a priority. By irrigation can stabilize, i.e. increase food production and encourage the development of livestock breeding, processing and other branches of economy in the region of Vojvodina and Srem area. Accordingly, the basic goals of the research are: 1) evaluation of factors of agricultural development with the analysis of impact to the planned construction and exploitation of the irrigation system, 2) market aspects of establishing the irrigation system with water of Srem region, 3) evaluation of market efficiency of agricultural production and 4) defining approach for determination of a new sowing structure under irrigation.
   Research has shown that irrigation increases the agricultural production efficiency, there makes impact to sowing structure change, and the market surpluses on the international market can be sold, by using the existing international agreements, signed by the Republic of Serbia. However, besides a great potential in the sector of agricultural production, as the result of favourable climatic conditions, natural land characteristics and available water resources, signed agreements on free trade - the potentials in agro-food sector have not been sufficiently used.

AB  - The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the economic impact of the application of irrigation in the production of basic field crops (maize, sunflower, soybean and sugar beet) on family farms operating in the South Banat area. Based on the data collected from the survey conducted on 75 family farms specialized in market oriented production without irrigation, using the method of models, calculation and comparison of the obtained results, an assessment was made of the economic impact of the application of irrigation in the production of basic field crops, as well as the assessment of their business performance. It has been established that the most significant economic impact from the application of irrigation in the production of basic field crops can be achieved on farms with 10-20 ha of arable land. Gross margins per hectare of arable land, depending on the type of soil prevailing in the holding, increased from 87% to 146%, while income per active member of the family farm dealing exclusively with agriculture could double.

AB  - In developing countries of the Asian monsoon region, participatory irrigation management (PIM) was introduced in the 1990s so that farmers rather than government staff could be partly or wholly responsible for operating, maintaining and managing irrigation projects. Whether or not farmers continuously participate in maintenance activities depends on the degree of their willingness to perform such activities. This study reviews the objectives, achievements and significance of a series of our six research papers that use a range of methods to increase the willingness of farmers to engage in maintenance activities, and also summarizes future perspectives of PIM sustainability. The results of the research papers showed a practical method and a new perspective for an efficient increase in the willingness of farmers; firstly by choosing factors with a new indicator, "maximum effective number of target persons", and then improving details of how the chosen factors were encouraged by adding an incentive perspective with "no decrease in vested benefits". Conversely, to simplify the questions regarding the selection of encouraging factors, the papers disregarded conditions such as the time and cost required for encouragement. The first priority is therefore to clarify the content of incentives based on factors that should be encouraged. Second, the findings of the papers cover only the most fundamental factors associated with PIM sustainability. Therefore, to effectively and efficiently improve PIM sustainability, there is a need to analyze "factors other than willingness" that influence the inclination to engage in maintenance activities.

AB  - "Knowledge Assessment on Sustainable Water Resources Management for Irrigation" (KASWARMI) project made evident cases of unsuccessful or non sustainable irrigation experiences that could only be explained by the underestimation of deep socioeconomic issues. This involves not only the social factors related to the implementation/adoption of new or better technologies by a wide spectrum of users but also the way in which water use and irrigation projects are conceived, planned and implemented by scientists, politicians and practitioners. The project was interested in assessing the social science inputs irrigation specialists receive. With this objective, this paper presents a state of the art on some selected socioeconomic subjects as they appear in the irrigation literature, and analyzes the way in which they are conceived, thought and articulated with the more "technical" factors of irrigation. This should be useful to raise new avenues of research and to enhance articulation of "technical" and social science approaches in quest of a more close to sustainability irrigation practices. A first search covered eight of the most prestigious journals devoted to irrigation subjects. After this search yielded meager results in terms of the amount of papers found, a new search was conducted, without restraining to specific journals but moving freely with a deliberate thematic purpose. The results showed less socioeconomic issues than desirable in the papers within easy reach of irrigation engineers, a meager presence of Latin American cases and an approach to socioeconomic subjects that lack comprehensiveness, as they did not appear to be fully articulated with the technical subjects of irrigation.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture accounts for almost 30% of total crop production and is the single largest user of water in South Africa. The country is water-scarce, and, although water consumption through irrigation has decreased from 80 to about 50% over the past 25 years, the need to improve water use efficiency in irrigation farming is more imperative than ever. Generally, smallholder irrigation schemes (SIS) in South Africa have performed poorly and have not delivered on their development objectives of increasing crop production and improving rural livelihoods. The poor performance of many SIS in terms of productivity and economic impact has been largely attributed to socio-economic, political, climatic, edaphic and design factors, as well as lack of farmer participation. Research and expenditure has tended to concentrate on rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure, but evidence indicate low yield levels and limited knowledge of crop production among farmers as probably the main reasons for the failure of many SIS in South Africa. The tendency to focus on infrastructure has often yielded little and proved to be fruitless because the human capital was not developed to effectively utilise and maintain the infrastructure. This indicates that farmer practice may actually be constraining performance in spite of the state of irrigation infrastructure. It is therefore recommended that crop production approaches including farmer training be considered alongside all other issues during revitalisation of SIS to improve on performance.

AB  - This study aims to review previous studies and projects on hydropower generation using irrigation canals in Japan, and discusses their future perspectives. The Japanese agricultural sector uses around two thirds of the total water abstracted, which is channeled through dams, headworks, as well as 40,000 km of canal networks. Although such infrastructure would collectively have significant hydropower generation potential, it has attracted scant attention, due to the relatively low individual potential at each site. To effectively utilize such small and diffuse potentials, we would need to: (1) develop small waterwheels operable with small water heads and low flow rates; (2) develop techniques to identify suitable waterwheel sites within an existing canal system taking channel slopes and side-wall heights and seasonal variations in flow rates into consideration; (3) investigate the possibility of locally utilizing electricity on a micro-scale of a few kW, rather than selling it to the grid; and (4) modify the water management scheme where possible by, for instance, smoothing out flow rates across seasons and thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of power generation.

AB  - It is important to understand and evaluate the environmental impacts of all crops if we are to develop more sustainable production systems. Understanding the impact of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) is particularly important as there are alternative crops that can be used for sugar production and also because there is growing interest in its potential as a source for biofuel. This paper presents the findings of a research project to evaluate the environmental impact and economic viability of the range of sugar beet production systems in the UK. The study used 13 sugar beet production scenarios that represent those used throughout the UK. These scenarios differed in soil type, nutrients applied (inorganic and organic), crop protection (chemical and cultural) and use of irrigation. The assessment included an evaluation of inputs (nutrients, pesticides and energy) and their impact on the environment. A net margin for each scenario was also calculated to provide an economic assessment. An average of the assessment results for the different parameters across the scenarios was calculated (weighted by the sugar beet area each scenario represented) to provide a mean figure for sugar beet production in the UK. The results for this mean on a per ha basis were a yield of 52 t. a net margin of 560, consumption of 21.4 GJ of energy, emission of 1.4 equiv. t of carbon dioxide, 3.3 kg nitrogen leached. 15.2 kg nitrogen lost to denitrification and a pesticide ecotoxicity score of 26 (low). A sustainability profile, on a per ha and a per tonne basis, for each of the 13 scenarios was constructed enabling all scenarios to be compared in terms of their overall environmental and economic performance. This comparison showed that the most profitable scenario also had the best overall environmental performance. This scenario represented 18% of UK sugar beet area. Three other scenarios that represented 57% of the total area closely followed this performance. The overall performance of the organic scenario was equal to the best conventional scenario on a per ha basis, but on a per t basis its performance was lower (similar to the mean for sugar beet in the UK) due to its significantly lower yield. This study illustrates that a significant proportion of the UK crop is being grown in an economically efficient way whilst minimising environmental damage. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE

KW  - FAO CROP MODEL
KW  - FERTILIZATION
AB  - In the past 20 years, extreme weather events (atypical variations of temperature and precipitation in space and time) have increased in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the consequences being significant material damage and decreased crop yields. The aims of the current paper were to investigate the impact of climate change on yield, irrigation requirements and water productivity of maize grown in one of the most important agricultural regions of the country. It used the results of projections of the EBU-POM regional climate model (Eta Belgrade University - Princeton Ocean Model) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B, A2 and A1B > carbon dioxide (CO2), A2 > CO2 for the 2020s (2010-2039), the 2050s (2040-2069) and the 2080s (2070-2099), and it compared them with the reference period (1961-1990) using measured and modelled data. AquaCrop was calibrated for the study area using data from experimental studies. The model was applied in simulations of future cultivation scenarios considering different irrigation regimes and variations in precipitation, temperature, CO2 concentration and sowing date. The results of simulations indicate that in the 2020s, there will be no significant changes in irrigation needs and yield due to the earlier sowing date and overall shifting of the growing season early in spring. A slightly larger negative impact of climate change will occur by the 2050s and a larger one by the 2080s due to a reduction in precipitation in the summer months. Compared with the reference period, in the 2080s, irrigation requirements are expected to increase by almost 100% (from 100 to 200 mm) and to provide up to 30% greater yield. In the future, water productivity of maize will remain high and will be even greater than current levels for both rainfed and irrigated cultivation due to anticipation and shortening of the growing season, reduction in crop evapotranspiration and increase in CO2 concentration. Due to an increase in precipitation in early spring and its reduction in the May-June period, the blue-to-green water ratio will increase in the future with positive environmental connotations. The productive use of blue water will also increase.

AB  - The aim of this review is to report changes in irrigated cotton water use from research projects and on-farm practice-change programs in Australia, in relation to both plant-based and irrigation engineering disciplines. At least 80% of the Australian cotton-growing area is irrigated using gravity surface-irrigation systems. This review found that, over 23 years, cotton crops utilise 6-7ML/ha of irrigation water, depending on the amount of seasonal rain received. The seasonal evapotranspiration of surface-irrigated crops averaged 729mm over this period. Over the past decade, water-use productivity by Australian cotton growers has improved by 40%. This has been achieved by both yield increases and more efficient water-management systems. The whole-farm irrigation efficiency index improved from 57% to 70%, and the crop water use index is >3kg/mm.ha, high by international standards. Yield increases over the last decade can be attributed to plant-breeding advances, the adoption of genetically modified varieties, and improved crop management. Also, there has been increased use of irrigation scheduling tools and furrow-irrigation system optimisation evaluations. This has reduced in-field deep-drainage losses. The largest loss component of the farm water balance on cotton farms is evaporation from on-farm water storages. Some farmers are changing to alternative systems such as centre pivots and lateral-move machines, and increasing numbers of these alternatives are expected. These systems can achieve considerable labour and water savings, but have significantly higher energy costs associated with water pumping and machine operation. The optimisation of interactions between water, soils, labour, carbon emissions and energy efficiency requires more research and on-farm evaluations. Standardisation of water-use efficiency measures and improved water measurement techniques for surface irrigation are important research outcomes to enable valid irrigation benchmarks to be established and compared. Water-use performance is highly variable between cotton farmers and farming fields and across regions. Therefore, site-specific measurement is important. The range in the presented datasets indicates potential for further improvement in water-use efficiency and productivity on Australian cotton farms.

AB  - Farm models are potentially relevant tools for policy impact assessment. Governments and international organizations use impact assessment (IA) as an ex-ante policy process and procedure to evaluate impacts of policy options as part of the introduction of new policies. IA is increasingly used. This paper reviews both the use of farm models in such policy lAs in the European Commission, and the development and use of farm models for policy IA by the scientific community over the past decade. A systematic review was performed, based on 202 studies from the period 2007-2015 and results were discussed in a science-policy workshop. Based on the literature review and the workshop, this paper describes progress in the development of farm models, challenges in their use in policy processes and a research and cooperation agenda. We conclude that main issues for a research agenda include: 1) better understanding of farmer decision-making and effects of the social milieu, with increased focus on the interactions between farmers and other actors, the link to the value chain, and farm structural change; 2) thorough and consistent model evaluation and model comparison, with increased attention for model sensitivity and uncertainty, and 3) the organization of a network of farm modellers. In addition, the agenda for science-policy cooperation emphasizes the need for: 4) synthesizing research evidence into systematic reviews as an institutional element in the existing science-policy-interfaces for agricultural systems, 5) improved and timely data collection, allowing to assess heterogeneity in farm objectives, management and indicators, and 6) stronger science-policy interaction, moving from a research-driven to a user-driven approach.

AB  - Agriculture in southeastern Oregon and southwestern Idaho known collectively as the Treasure Valley has depended on furrow irrigation using heavy inputs of water and nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Crop rotations include onion, corn, wheat, sugar beet, potato, bean, and other crops. By 1986 groundwater had become contaminated with nitrate and residues of the herbicide chlorthal-dimethyl (DCPA); an official groundwater management area was established by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality along with an action plan and well monitoring network. The action plan allowed for a trial period to see whether voluntary changes would improve trends. Researchers, producers, and agencies cooperated to develop production options that had the possibility of being both environmentally protective and cost effective. Options were tested to improve irrigation practices, increase N fertilizer use efficiency on several rotation crops, and find a cost effective replacement for DCPA. Research demonstrated the opportunity for increased productivity through both irrigation scheduling and the adoption of drip and sprinkler systems. Fertilizer research demonstrated that smaller, more frequent N applications were more efficient than a single large application. Effective, lower cost herbicides replaced DCPA. Research results were effectively delivered through many means and voluntarily adopted. Both groundwater nitrate and DCPA residues are declining. Productivity has increased.

AB  - Increasingly serious shortages of water make it imperative to improve the efficiency of irrigation in agriculture, horticulture and in the maintenance of urban landscapes. the main aim Of the Current review is to identify ways of meeting this objective. After reviewing Current irrigation practices, discussion is centred on the sensitivity of crops to water deficit, the finding that growth of many crops is unaffected by considerable lowering of soil water content and, on this basis, the creation of improved means of irrigation scheduling. Subsequently, attention is focused on irrigation problems associated with spatial variability in soil water and the often slow infiltration of water into soil, especially the subsoil. As monitoring of soil water is important for estimating irrigation requirements the attributes Of the two main types of soil water sensors and their most appropriate uses are described. Attention is also drawn to the contribution of wireless technology to the transmission of sensor Outputs. Rapid progress is being made in transmitting sensor data, obtained from different depths down the soil profile across irrigated areas, to a PC that processes the data and on this basis automatically commands irrigation equipment to deliver amounts of water, according to need, across the field. To help interpret sensor Outputs, and for many other reasons, principles of water processes in the soil-plant system are incorporated into simulation models that are calibrated and tested in field experiments. Finally, it is emphasized that the relative importance of the factors discussed ill this review to any particular Situation varies enormously.

Water consumption by agriculture in Latin America and the Caribbean: impact of climate change and applications of nuclear and isotopic techniques. Int. J. Agric. Nat. Resour. 1-21. The main aim of this review is to examine agricultural water consumption in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) regions to understand how climate change will impact water availability and how the application of nuclear and stable isotope techniques can be used as tools for improving water use efficiency (WUE) for crop production. The status of agricultural water management in some LAC countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, is also reviewed. In the LAC region, water consumption for agricultural irrigation ranged between 35% and 86% of the total available water. However, the WUE is very low in some LAC countries. Although the region, in general, has adequate water resources, there is still a need to improve WUE to increase the productivity of agricultural water. The impact of climate change in some LAC countries may lead to intensification and expansion of agricultural activity. In these areas, the WUE can be improved through soil and water conservation, minimizing soil evaporation (E), as well as through better irrigation management, especially by using an integrated approach on an area-wide basis to manage all land use activities and farming systems within an agricultural catchment. Nuclear and stable isotope techniques using Keeling Plot or IMB methods can play important roles in improving WUE in agriculture in LAC countries by providing information related to soil water losses for improving irrigation systems.

AB  - This work analyses the main research trends (subjects, methodology used, countries of the authors and data) in the economics of irrigation water during the last 10 years (2000-2009). For this purpose, a quantitative methodology has been used which is new to this sphere, based on the review of a representative sample of 332 papers published in the 15 most important journals focused on this field of science indexed in the databases of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Science Citation Index (SCCI). The results obtained confirm: a) the notable growth in the number of papers published, especially in the last three years, b) the high degree of collaboration between authors, including those of different origin, for their performance c) the prominence of the USA, Australia, India and Spain as the countries of the first authors and origin of the data, d) the greater attention given to subjects related with "investment project analysis", "production planning" and, especially, "production function and productivity of water", and e) the predominance of empirical studies that use basic analysis approaches (cost analysis, investment evaluation, etc.).

AB  - CONTEXT: A host of best water and soil management practices (BMPs) hold promise in addressing water scarcity and land degradation to enable sustainable crop intensification in smallholder farming systems.
   OBJECTIVE This study quantifies the effect of BMPs on crop productivity, income, water saving and water balance components and identifies gaps for future research.
   METHODS: This paper synthesizes the performance of BMPs and the existing data gap by reviewing 108 published studies from the Indian subcontinent which capture a diverse range of rainfall and cropping systems.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In situ conservation measures helped enhance crop yields by 200-1000 kg/ha, reduced cost of cultivation and enhanced incomes by US$ 10-200/ha/year. The BMPs were helpful in enabling annual water saving in the range of 50 mm to 300 mm by either conserving residual soil moisture or saving irrigation water resulting in enhanced water productivity. Interventions such as direct seeded rice and laser land leveling were found most effective in terms of water saving and in reducing cost of cultivation. On the other hand, ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions helped enhance groundwater recharge by harvesting an additional 50-150 mm of surface runoff which helped increase crop yields, led to sustainable crop intensification and strengthened the number of ecosystem services. Most of the published literature on in situ conservation measures are studies that were carried out at research stations, which show promise of sustainable intensification. However, greater efforts are needed to document learnings from farmer/community scale interventions for effective scaling up. There is also a gap in data availability that hampers a clear understanding of the impact of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions and ecosystem trade-offs; moreover the data available covers short pe- riods and only covers an area of up to 10 km(2). We recommend the monitoring of long-term system-level impact indicators to realize the potential of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions in a systems perspective and better grasp the ecosystem trade-offs.
   SIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the review revealed the ample scope of integrating in situ and ex situ in- terventions to build system-level resilience in smallholder farming systems in order to accelerate progress to- wards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB  - In the field of farm management and in related multidisciplinary fields such as bio-economic farm modeling and hydro-economic regional modeling, much attention has recently been paid to positive mathematical programming (PM P), primarily because of its ability to exactly reproduce an observed set of endogenous input variables in the model (e.g., an observed land-use pattern for crop productions) as the result of optimization. In mathematical terms, PMP is an inverse problem of quadratic programming (QP), where the objective function is calibrated on the basis of the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the optimization of the QP model and of a linear programming model that is prepared for the calibration of parameters in the QP model. The two types of optimum conditions derived from the models are combined to obtain linear equations for the calibration of the QP model. However, as is often the case with inverse problems, the equations for the calibration are indefinite because the number of parameters to be calibrated surpasses the number of equations. As a result, various methods have been proposed to solve this so-called "ill-posed" problem. The main objectives of the present paper are to examine how the calibration methods developed in previous PM P models are related to one another and to propose practical procedures for determining which calibration method is the most appropriate from the viewpoint of sensitivity analyses. A simple conceptual framework is proposed to relate the previously developed calibration methods, and it is then applied to exemplify criteria for selecting a calibration method from the viewpoint of simulation results. A new direction in PMP-based farm modeling in which more feasible simulation results can be derived is also discussed.

AB  - Abiotic stresses are major constraints to crop production and food security worldwide, the increasing trend and projection under climate change pose further challenge and warrants close attention of researchers and policy makers. Heat and drought are judged as most common stresses having adverse impact on growth and productivity of the crops. Understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and ecological responses of these stresses is prerequisite to develop management practices. The plant responses to these stresses can be categorized into morphological, physiological, and biochemical responses quantified to assess their impact. Though plants have capability to modify their growth pattern and physiological process to cope with heat and drought stresses but it costs dearly in terms of overall performance and yield, therefore it is a must to understand plant response to various stresses in order to develop suitable adaptation strategies. This review focuses on the plant responses towards heat and drought stresses pointing on the commonalities and differences. Due to physical damages, physiological disruptions, and biochemical changes under limited water supply and elevated temperatures there is negative impact on crop growth and yields. Both conventional and modern approaches are desired to deal with heat and drought stresses. A holistic approach including short term strategy comprising management practices promoting in-situ moisture conservation, water harvesting, micro environment modification etc, and long term strategies including developing heat and drought tolerant varieties, developing irrigation infrastructure, permanent change in land configuration, etc are required. The recent government. initiative like PMKSY aiming irrigation to each field (Har Khet Ko Pani) through water harvesting, conveyance, drip irrigation in the back drop of time bound target of doubling farmers income will be a big boost to cope heat and drought stress and to induce climatic resilience.

AB  - Water scarcity is the most serious abiotic stress restricting plant productivity throughout the world. Losses in crop yield due to drought exceed from losses caused by other environmental factors. In this review article different morphological, physiological and yield attributes of cotton under drought stress, mechanism of drought induced losses and various management strategies to mitigate drought stress have been discussed. Drought stress reduces growth of leaf, stem and root, interferes with leaf water relations, photosynthesis, respiration, reduces water-use efficiency and ultimately yield of cotton. Under water deficit conditions cotton shows various responses to cope with drought stress. The major mechanisms include accumulation of osmoregulators, plant growth regulators and production of heat shock proteins. Different management strategies to alleviate water deficit stress like foliar application of osmolytes, potassium and growth regulators (hormones), various drought responsive genes, proteins at molecular level, screening and breeding programs against drought tolerance and mulching are also discussed in this paper.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural management implies optimization of resources for crop production while minimizing adverse impacts on the environment. This requires a better understanding of the synergies and trade-offs of agronomic management while accounting for the controlling effects of site-specific factors (covariates). We systematically evaluated 113 meta-analytical studies assessing impacts of crop management measures (rotation, cover cropping, residue retention), soil and water measures (irrigation, tillage), soil amendments (enhanced efficiency, biochar), fertilizer use (organic, mineral, combined organic-mineral) and "4R'" fertilizer strategies (right source, rate, timing, placement) on sustainability indicators. These indicators include crop yield, crop N and P (content, uptake, and use efficiency), soil quality indicators (soil organic C, N and P contents, compaction), soil emissions of ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O), and nutrient losses to water (N and P surplus or leaching). Nutrient management, including 4R practices as well as enhanced efficiency amendments, had the largest impact, increasing crop yields and N uptake while reducing N2O and NH3 emissions as well as N surplus, whereas effects on CO2 emissions were variable. Although all measures positively impacted soil C, the largest effect was due to biochar, followed by organic fertilizer input. Biochar positively impacted crop yield, diminished N2O and NH3 emissions as well as N surplus, and increased CO2 emissions. Within crop management, only cover cropping had a significant positive effect on crop yield, while both cover crops and rotation slightly enhanced N uptake and the sequestration of C and N in soil, thus reducing N2O emissions and N surplus. Minimal tillage practices generally increased SOC, while results for crop yield, N surplus and N2O emissions were variable. Sitespecific factors had substantial impacts on the evaluated impacts of measures, most importantly climate, crop type, soil texture, soil pH, soil organic C, N dose, and experimental duration. Considering the variation among meta-analytical protocols followed, we recommend that field studies and meta-analytical work adhere to harmonized guidelines with respect to the reporting of site-level data, experimental design, and the statistical procedures used. This will ensure data comparability between studies, improve the quality of meta-analysis results, and give better insights into currently uncertain or unknown impacts of agronomic measures.

AB  - CONTEXT: An artificial oasis is a desert area suitable for human occupation and agriculture by human man-agement. Agricultural reclamation in artificial oases provides a means for population growth and urban expansion in arid regions, but it comes at an environmental cost. OBJECTIVE: Xinjiang is a largely arid region in northwest China, in which agricultural cultivation is concentrated in piedmont oases. Xinjiang's agriculture expansion has placed it as the largest cotton and grape producing area in China. This study seeks to understand better the successes and challenges facing oasis agriculture and propose possible solutions. METHODS: Through field investigation, experiments, and data collection, we reviewed a typical case of agri-cultural development over the past 60 years in the Mosuowan irrigation area of Xinjiang. We summarized the experiences and problems that emerged and then put forward some suggestions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified four factors that are critical for successful agricultural develop-ment: (1) irrigation infrastructure and water conservancy projects; (2) land consolidation; (3) intensive agri-cultural management; and (4) irrigation technology improvements. After nearly 60 years of rapid agricultural reclamation, we identified several challenges in sustainable agricultural development: (1) soil salinization; (2) ecological and environmental deterioration; (3) declines in economic benefits; (4) and soil and environment pollution. We propose the following measures that may feasibly address these concerns, respectively: (1) comprehensively harness saline-alkali land by means of improvers, biological methods, and drainage infrastructure; (2) establish desert-oasis ecological buffer zones; (3) adjust agricultural management policies; (4) and improve plastic recycling or degradability and adjusting irrigation and fertilization strategies to reduce soil pollution. SIGNIFICANCE: Oasis agriculture is a complex and fragile system, and its sustainable development needs to be rooted in scientific management. We hope that our review can provide some reference for agricultural development in similar areas.

AB  - Paper's focus is on the economic effects of introducing energy from renewable sources (solar energy) in the raspberry production (mainly for irrigation). Main goal is to assess economic effectiveness of investment in establishing and exploiting raspberry plantation, as well as implementation of required equipment and mechanization, from the point of two investment scenarios. First scenario considers conventional way of raspberry production, compared to raspberry production under mobile solar robotized electric generator. Methodologically, the analysis implies application of a set of methods for dynamic evaluation of investment and methods for evaluation of investments under uncertainty (the net present value, the internal rate of return, the payback period and the break-even point). The result of conducted assessment shows that, apart from ecological benefit, there is high economic justification of investment into device used for transfer of renewable into electric energy in raspberry production.

AB  - The application of nanotechnology in the field of agriculture as nanofertilizers or nanopesticides is receiving increased attention from regulatory agencies and research institutions worldwide. Soil and bodies of water are among the most massive sinks for commercial products containing engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) after use. This may affect agricultural ecosystems, mainly those with a high demand for irrigation water supply such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. This review describes the responses of different rice cultivars exposed to ENPs at different growth stages and under different conditions. Data on seed germination, uptake and translocation of ENPs, biomass production, nutrient profiles, and photosynthesis-related parameters are discussed. Critical knowledge gaps concerning the potential use of nanotechnology to improve agricultural production are highlighted.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the sustainability of the agricultural production chain of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Brazil and Cuba, using a conceptual model that considers five sectors of sustainability supported in the Goals Programming philosophy as multicriteria analysis tools. A synthetic sustainability indicator is constructed to support decision-making through the benchmarking process to contribute the environmental, economic and social sustainability of rice farming. As results, Brazil shows a greater sustainability based on better availability of environmental resources for rice cultivation, a lower relative environmental load, better economic and productive performance, poorer employment and wage policies and higher satisfaction of the social demand for rice. On the other hand, Cuba shows a deficit of environmental resources, higher relative environmental load, low economic and productive performance, better employment and wage policies, and unsatisfied social demand for rice.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP), one of the most important agricultural regions in China, is facing a major water-resource crisis evoked by excessive exploitation of groundwater. To reduce water use while maintaining high crop production level, improving variety water use efficiency (WUE) is an urgent need, especially because other water-saving measures such as water delivery, irrigation, and agricultural practices have already achieved most possible progresses. Evaluation of variety WUE can be performed accurately at the individual plant level (WUEp). Reviewing the studies on physiological factors affecting WUEp performed up to date, stomatal conductance was considered to be an important trait associating closely with WUEp. The trait showed a large degree of varietal variability under well-watered conditions. Crop varieties differ highly in sensitivity of stomata to soil and air drying, with some varieties strongly reducing their stomatal conductance in contrast with those lightly regulating their stomata. As a result, difference among varieties in WUEp was enlarged under water deficit conditions in contrast with those under well-watered conditions. The relationship between stomatal conductance and yield depends on water availability of whole growing period in local areas. Usually, large stomatal conductance results in a high yield under good irrigation system, whereas a low stomatal conductance can lead to yield benefit under limited stored soil moisture conditions. In the NCP, winter wheat is the largest consumer of irrigation water, improvement strategies for high WUE aiming at wheat crops are in urgent need. We suggest, for the well-irrigated areas with excessive exploitation of groundwater, the wheat breeding program need to combine medium stomatal conductance (0.35 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1) or so), high carboxylation efficiency, and high harvest index. Areas with partial/full access to irrigation, or infrequent drought, should target wheat varieties with high stomatal conductance under no water stress and low sensitivity of stomata to soil water deficit. Drought-prone rain-fed areas characterized by frequent and long terminal drought should target wheat varieties with low stomatal conductance under no water stress and high stomata sensitivity to soil drying to make water available during grain filling.

AB  - The determination of leaf water potential is useful in the establishment of irrigation guidelines for agricultural crop management practices and requires the use of various methods, among which thermocouple psychrometers (TCP). TCP have been widely used for this purpose. However, the psychrometric technique is complex and difficult to understand and the instrumentation required is difficult to handle. For this reason, a profound knowledge of the different aspects involved in the technique-which have not been clearly explained in the literature-is required. This paper reviews a number of research areas of TCP and focuses on three very specific fields: a) main applications of phsychrometry in field studies; b) determination of the measurement accuracy of psychrometric equipment, accuracy per se and accuracy tested against alternative methods; c) main errors and handling difficulties of TCP in the field. Research in these areas provides an updated overview of TCP as a method for determining water relations in plant material that will contribute criteria to select the most suitable technique according to the type of plant material and the purpose of the research and will highlight the types of instruments, accuracies and errors that have detrimental effects on measurements.

AB  - the presence of fixed orthodontic appliances and its accessories tends to affect bacterial plaque removal, resulting in inadequate cleaning being performed by the patient. Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to answer the following focal question: are the mechanical methods of oral cleaning effective for the reduction of bacterial dental plaque in patients with a fixed orthodontic appliance? A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, and Medline, in addition to Controlled Trials and Grey Literature, without limitations of language and year of publication. Furthermore, searches were also conducted in the reference lists of the articles selected. Included in the present review were clinical studies with patients undergoing therapy with fixed orthodontic appliances, which would, by means of comparison, evaluate the effectiveness of different mechanical bacterial plaque removal methods. The methodological quality of the articles included was evaluated in accordance with the methodological evaluation protocol, and was classified as high, moderate or low. In order to perform the meta-analysis, articles with high methodological quality were included. Analysis of subgroups was performed according to the type of intervention. The plaque index was defined as the continuous outcome variable, using the fixed effect when there was homogeneity among the articles, and the random effect in cases of heterogeneity. 1815 articles were found, of which only 23 fulfilled the eligibility criteria, with 17 being of high methodological quality and 6 of moderate quality. Of these, 18 included an analysis of the effectiveness of the conventional manual brush, 4 of the manual orthodontic brush, 15 of electric brushes, 3 of interdental brushes, 1 of dental floss and 4 or oral irrigation devices, and 1 of Siwak. In the qualitative evaluation of the studies, the use of these mechanical control methods was shown to be effective, with exception of the use of Siwak, which presented an increase in bacterial plaque. Moreover, the results of the meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction of -0.98 (IC 95%) in the plaque index for the use of conventional manual brushes in the period of one month (p<0.001). There is a body of evidence that proves the effectiveness of mechanical bacterial plaque removal in patients using orthodontic appliances and accessories. The findings of the meta-analysis proved the effectiveness of the conventional manual brush. Further studies with better standardization of samples are required to strengthen the evidences.

AB  - The upland agricultural soils in North China are distributed north of a line between the Kunlun Mountains, the Qinling Mountains and the Huaihe River. They occur in arid, semi-arid and semi-humid regions and crop production often depends on rain-fed or irrigation to supplement rainfall. This paper summarizes the characteristics of gross nitrogen (N) transformation, the fate of N fertilizer and soil N as well as the N loss pathway, and makes suggestions for proper N management in the region. The soils of the region are characterized by strong N mineralization and nitrification, and weak immobilization and denitrification ability, which lead to the production and accumulation of nitrate in the soil profile. Large amounts of accumulated nitrate have been observed in the vadose-zone in soils due to excess N fertilization in the past three decades, and this nitrate is subject to occasional leaching which leads to groundwater nitrate contamination. Under farmer's conventional high N fertilization practice in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system (N application rate was approximately 600 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), crop N uptake, soil residual N, NH3 volatilization, NO3- leaching, and denitrification loss accounted for around 27, 30, 23, 18 and 2% of the applied fertilizer N, respectively. NH3 volatilization and NO3- leaching were the most important N loss pathways while soil residual N was an important fate of N fertilizer for replenishing soil N depletion from crop production. The upland agricultural soils in North China are a large source of N2O and total emissions in this region make up a large proportion (approximately 54%) of Chinese cropland N2O emissions. The "non-coupled strong ammonia oxidation" process is an important mechanism of N2O production. Slowing down ammonia oxidation after ammonium-N fertilizer or urea application and avoiding transient high soil NH4+ concentrations are key measures for reducing N2O emissions in this region. Further N management should aim to minimize N losses from crop and livestock production, and increase the recycling of manure and straw back to cropland. We also recommend adoption of the 4R (Right soure, Right rate, Right time, Right place) fertilization techniques to realize proper N fertilizer management, and improving application methods or modifying fertilizer types to reduce NH3 volatilization, improving water management to reduce NO3- leaching, and controlling the strong ammonia oxidation process to abate N2O emission. Future research should focus on the study of the trade-off effects among different N loss pathways under different N application methods or fertilizer products.

AB  - UC has been heavily involved in research and extension efforts impacting landscape water conservation legislation for over 30 years. In 1981, UC implemented the California Irrigation Management Information System, a network of weather stations that provides data for local estimates of plant water needs. Those estimates led to UC being able to advise the California Legislature on policies for maximum applied water allowances for residential and large landscaping projects. The allowances have been reduced significantly with UC guidance, and UC has helped landscapers to meet the increasingly restrictive requirements. Best practices that reduce water losses have been developed in collaboration with equipment manufacturers and landscaping specialists, and explained to end users. In addition, UC has developed the WUCOLS database, which classifies over 3,500 plants by their water needs. UC's involvement in landscape water conservation continues on many fronts, developing science and contributing to policy.

AB  - This paper presents a methodological approach to the analysis of various combinations of agricultural policy and irrigation water-pricing alternatives. Policy scenarios are simulated by means of multi-criteria mathematical programming models capable of simulating the behaviour of farmers. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) has been chosen as the methodological framework for model-building at farm level. Modelling representative farms in this way enables differential impacts of scenarios considered to be simulated and, through a process of aggregation, global results at basin level to be obtained. Results obtained from the simulation models are not only related to farmers' decision variables (crop mixes). A set of relevant economic, social and environmental attributes related to public criteria can also be obtained as a way of measuring the efficiency of the suggested policy scenarios. This methodology has been applied to the analysis of irrigated agriculture in the Douro Basin in Spain. The results show the usefulness of this methodological approach to evaluate the impact of policies and highlight the fact that water pricing and agricultural policy need to be closely coordinated in order to meet the EU's policy objectives for the irrigated agriculture sector.

AB  - An integrated assessment of the potential of different management practices for mitigating specific components of the total GHG budget (N2O and CH4 emissions and C sequestration) of Mediterranean agrosystems was performed in this study. Their suitability regarding both yield and environmental (e.g. nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization) sustainability, and regional barriers and opportunities for their implementation were also considered. Based on its results best strategies to abate GHG emissions in Mediterranean agro-systems were proposed. Adjusting N fertilization to crop needs in both irrigated and rain-fed systems could reduce N2O emissions up to 50% compared with a non-adjusted practice. Substitution of N synthetic fertilizers by solid manure can be also implemented in those systems, and may abate N2O emissions by about 20% under Mediterranean conditions, with additional indirect benefits associated to energy savings and positive effects in crop yields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors enhances N use efficiency of the cropping systems and may mitigate N2O emissions up to 80% and 50%, respectively. The type of irrigation may also have a great mitigation potential in the Mediterranean region. Drip-irrigated systems have on average 80% lower N2O emissions than sprinkler systems and drip-irrigation combined with optimized fertilization showed a reduction in direct N2O emissions up to 50%. Methane fluxes have a relatively small contribution to the total GHG budget of Mediterranean crops, which can mostly be controlled by careful management of the water table and organic inputs in paddies. Reduced soil tillage, improved management of crop residues and agro-industry by-products, and cover cropping in orchards, are the most suitable interventions to enhance organic C stocks in Mediterranean agricultural soils. The adoption of the proposed agricultural practices will require farmers training. The global analysis of life cycle emissions associated to irrigation type (drip, sprinkle and furrow) and N fertilization rate (100 and 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) revealed that these factors may outweigh the reduction in GHG emissions beyond the plot scale. The analysis of the impact of some structural changes on top-down mitigation of GHG emissions revealed that 3-15% of N2O emissions could be suppressed by avoiding food waste at the end-consumer level. A 40% reduction in meat and dairy consumption could reduce GHG emissions by 20-30%. Reintroducing the Mediterranean diet (i.e. similar to 35% intake of animal protein) would therefore result in a significant decrease of GHG emissions from agricultural production systems under Mediterranean conditions.

AB  - The need of alternatives of fossil fuel is pressing hard for several reasons, especially to the countries like India with vibrant economy which consumes large amount of fossil fuels and rely heavily on import for the same. Among several oil-yielding crops and tree-borne oilseeds, Jatropha has been identified as most potential plant for biodiesel due to its advantages over other plant species. Concerted R&D works on bio-fuel species like Jatropha started in 2003 after the committee constituted for bio-fuel development in India presented its report to Planning Commission and then several organizations like ICAR, NOVOD Board, DBT, DST, DRDO, and CSIR started funding on R&D of TBOs to several research institutions including SAUs. Immediately, first national programme on Jatropha cultivation was initiated in 2004, with a target of 4 lakh ha plantation, which could not be achieved in absence of suitable varieties and improved planting materials. At present the R&D efforts were focused on collection, evaluation and conservation of its germplasm, understanding its breeding behaviour, standardization of nursery and propagation techniques, development of cultivation packages for different soil and climatic conditions, machines for bio-diesel production etc. A large number of accessions from almost all the areas of its distribution in the country have been collected by research institutions. Good amount of variability has been recorded in morphological traits, seed yield and oil content. Genotypes having high seed yield and oil content have been selected from germplasm evaluation trials but their consistency over the years and environments yet to be confirmed. Seed yield has been improved to a limited extent through intraspecific hybridization but breakthrough will only be possible by the development of inbred lines and intensive breeding programmes, which will take long time. The agro-techniques for raising plantation has been standardized up to limited extent as fertilizer and irrigation requirements are yet to be worked out for different types of soil and climatic conditions. Though, propagation techniques through seed, cuttings and tissue culture are well developed. Chemical composition of oil, cake and biodiesel, its suitability for engines have already been assessed but there is need of intensive work on value-addition like detoxification of cake to make it suitable for cattle feed. As Jatropha cultivation is projected for the wastelands, the development of varieties for moisture stress, degraded and marginal lands are urgently required. In nutshell, Jatropha research is still at the beginning with respect to genetic improvement for increasing seed and oil yield. High variability provides good opportunity for selection of desired types and success in breeding programme. The article summarizes the need of the hour, current status of R&D efforts and future strategies to be made.

AB  - The remote sensing (RS) technique is less cost- and labour- intensive than ground-based surveys for diverse applications in agriculture. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), provides an effective approach to construct a model for regression and classification of a multivariate and non-linear system. Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning models learn from training data, i.e., past experience. Machine learning, when applied to remotely sensed data, has the potential to evolve a real-time farm-specific management system to reinforce farmers' ability to make appropriate decisions. Recently, the use of machine learning techniques combined with RS data has reshaped precision agriculture in many ways, such as crop identification, yield prediction and crop water stress assessment, with better accuracy than conventional RS methods. As agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of the worldwide water withdrawals, it must be used in the most efficient way to obtain maximum yields and food production. The use of water management and irrigation based on plant water stress have been demonstrated to not only save water but also increase yield. To date, RS and ML-based results have encouraged farmers and decision-makers to adopt this technology to meet global food demands. This phenomenon has led to the much-needed interest of researchers in using ML to improve agriculture outcomes. However, the use of ML for the potential evaluation of water stress continues to be unexplored and the existing methods can still be greatly improved. This study aims to present an overall review of the widely used methods for crop water stress monitoring using remote sensing and machine learning and focuses on future directions for researchers.

AB  - Flooded rice fields can provide habitats for wetland species and ecosystem services similar to those of natural wetlands. During the last three decades, however, farming practices and management systems have been intensified in many rice-producing countries. In addition, more recent socioeconomic changes have caused agricultural abandonment in some parts of East and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan. This study reviewed long-term statistics on rice farming, as well as the impact of agricultural intensification and abandonment on farmland biodiversity at multiple spatial scales in Japan. The impact of pesticide use was greatest in the 1950s-1970s, when the use of highly toxic agents had not yet been prohibited. More recently, different components of agricultural intensification have been the largest threat for various taxa, for example, chemical pesticides for aquatic plants and invertebrates and modern efficient irrigation/ drainage systems for amphibians, fishes, and waterbirds. The negative impacts of agricultural abandonment on farmland species have been rapidly increasing with the expansion of abandoned fields and the subsequent vegetation succession and loss of habitat heterogeneity. We also discuss the effectiveness of environmentally friendly farming practices, including the reduced use of pesticides, winter paddy flooding, and installation of fishways, to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on farmland species in rice-paddy landscapes.

AB  - Climate change is among the most crucial concerns of the world. It is a serious threat to the global agriculture and its overall impact on global agriculture is yet not clear. A rise of 2.5-4.5 degrees C is expected in the global temperature until the end of 21st century. The amount of greenhouse gases particularly CO2 is increasing at an alarming rate and is enhancing the plant photosynthesis and productivity. However, this increase in productivity is counteract by the more negative effects of climate change on agriculture like increased evapotranspiration, drought, floods, changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall, higher pest infestations and more irrigation demand. Climate change also affects the nutrients availability and efficiency by influencing microbial activities and population in the soil. Therefore, adaptation of agriculture sector to the changing climate is indispensable because of its sensitivity and size. This review is aimed to document the possible impacts of climate change on agriculture, its causes and future projections. Some strategies are also advised to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases, to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture and to make new policies keeping in view their broader consequences on agriculture.

AB  - Water quality in China is becoming a severe challenge for agriculture and food safety, and it might also impact health of population via agriculture and food. Thus, it is causing widespread concern. Based on extensive literatures review and data mining, current situation of water pollution in China and its effects on food safety were analyzed. The 2nd National Water Resource Survey in China show that the surface water all over the country was under slight pollution and about 60% of groundwater is polluted. Drinking water quality is basically guaranteed in urban area but it is worrisome in rural areas. In addition, China is the largest consumer of fertilizer and pesticide in the world and the amounts of application still show increasing trends. Fertilizers and pesticides are the most important sources of pollution, which affect human health as persistent organic pollutants and environmental endocrine disruptors. Eutrophication of surface water and nitrate pollution of groundwater are serious threats to drinking water safety. Sewage irrigation is becoming a pollution source to China's water and land because of lacking of effective regulations. Although, with the advance in technology and management level, control of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions and reducing water pollution is still a major challenge for China.

AB  - An intensive process of land deterioration of some regions in Uzbekistan including the Aral Sea basin has led to a significant increase in soil salinity levels and consequently to a considerable reduction of total fertile soil area, as these lands are of little use for plant growth. The area is estimated to be more than 1.4 million ha of seabed. As a result, there was an immediate need to cultivate new crops capable of stopping the movement of sands and the enlargement of saline soils. Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is considered to be a moderately salt-tolerant crop and, as such, one of a few crops well suited to the cropping systems of salt-affected soils. It is used in Uzbekistan as a reserve crop when the culture of the main crop fails. In spite of the great economic importance of this oil, there is almost no available information in the literature on the effect of salinity on oil quality and its chemical ingredients. The purpose of the present study was to determine, in greenhouse and field experiments, how irrigation with saline water would influence content of oil, lipids and other lipophylic components in safflower.
   We found that irrigation of safflower with moderate concentrations of saline water seems feasible, as far as oil and lipid composition is concerned. Consequently, safflower might be a potential crop for lands of little use for plant growth in Uzbekistan or other similar sites in the world.

AB  - Most areas of the world where rainfall is limiting are characterized by low agricultural output and, ironically, high population growth rates that generate increased food demand. Arid and semi-arid regions permit a range of vegetative biomass production, from rainfed crops to native pasture, and sparse steppe shrubs to true desert. Given the harsh climatic conditions in areas such as West Asia-North Africa, where less than 10% of the land area is amenable to rainfed cropping, soil resources are fragile and cropping conditions precarious. Yet with appropriate manipulation of soil fertility and crop management within a systems context, including breeding of improved cultivars, conservation tillage, and rotations, substantial production increases can occur at the farmer's level. While irrigation has increased considerably in the past few decades, having a major impact on crop yields, surface and ground water sources remain limited. Applied research specific to the region has shown that crop output can be considerably enhanced with adequate nutrition, most of which has to be added as commercial fertilizer. The substantial yield increases that have taken place in several countries of the region have been attributed to three factors: water, fertilizers, and improved varieties. Technologies that potentially produce such high yield increases include identification of nutrient stresses and taking corrective action, and, where appropriate, adapting the plant to the soil conditions. If managed properly, innovative cropping systems to overcome these constraints can improve rather than degrade soil conditions. Regardless of the advances in biotechnology, crop adaptation, and integrated cropping systems, chemical fertilizers will, in future, play an even greater role in the nutrition of both rainfed and irrigated crops in Mediterranean agriculture. Crop nutrition research will have to keep pace with agronomic developments. The future challenge in soil fertility-crop nutrition lies as much in overcoming obstacles to technology transfer as in the generation of new knowledge. This selective review is based mainly on the author's research experiences in the field of soil fertility and crop nutrition in the WANA region for the past 32 years. It seeks to highlight research developments within the context of the region's crop production constraints, culminating in a perspective on future research challenges within the framework of cooperation between international institutions and the region's national research and development programs.

AB  - Over the next decade, the superfast 5G network will play a critical role in farming industries to improve the yields and quality of crops while using minimal labor. Smart and precision farming allows farmers to be more informed and productive. The advent of 5G will considerably change the nature of jobs in farming and agriculture. The internet of things (IoT)-based cloud computing service in the 5G network provides flexible and efficient solutions for smart farming. This will allow the automated operation of various unmanned agricultural machines for the plowing, planting, and management phases of crop farming and will ultimately achieve secure, reliable, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient operations and enable unmanned farms. This paper provides a complete survey on 5G technology in the agricultural sector and discusses the need for and role of smart and precision farming; benefits of 5G; applications of 5G in precision farming such as real-time monitoring, virtual consultation and predictive maintenance, data analytics and cloud repositories; and future prospects.

AB  - Sahelian farmers tend to diversify their activities to reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. It is important to distinguish between farmers' types response to these shocks as well as to policy incentives. To develop a typology of farmer adaptation strategies, evaluate the level of vulnerability and assess perceptions of policies, two detailed questionnaire surveys were conducted in a community in northern Burkina Faso. Statistical analysis included a cluster analysis to distinguish farmers' types with regard to their assets and strategies. The results show that the main factors of discrimination were family size, access to small irrigation plots and number of animals. The types react differently to climate variability and are likely to follow contrasting pathways of adaptation. Farmers' food vulnerability is still high according to the applied CILSS vulnerability index, and farmers are pessimistic about their capacity to handle future droughts. They see improved credit schemes and further development of irrigation as the most promising adaptation strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - High-altitude ecosystems shelter important reserves of biodiversity, water provision and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Climate change, agricultural encroachment, overgrazing, and mining activities are endangering ecosystems sustainability, particularly in the high-Andean Puna. Increasing food demands in a region with limited agricultural land calls for agricultural intensification. Ecological intensification of agriculture is a framework for increasing agricultural productivity by fostering supporting and regulating ecosystem services (ES) while reducing negative environmental impacts. In this review we examine how agriculture use and disturb the provision of key ES in this ecoregion - food, wool and fiber provision, soil fertility, nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration, water provision and regulation, genetic resources, pest and disease control, pollination regulation and microclimate regulation. We also propose a set of technologies, practices and policies to preserve (or restore) the provision of these key ES: long fallowing, soil amendments, conservation tillage, rotational grazing, grassland ecological restoration, conservation of agrobiodiversity, modern irrigation and water harvesting, plant breeding, climate change mitigation schemes and payment for ecosystem services, and adapted traditional technologies.

AB  - In the literature, a lot of information is available about climate change perceptions and impacts in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is limited attention in the region to emerging initiatives, technologies and policies that are tailored to building the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems to climate change and variability. In this paper, we discuss the prospects for climate-smart agriculture technologies and enabling policies in dealing with climate change and variability at different sub-regional levels of sub-Saharan Africa to sustain farm productivity and livelihoods of agrarian communities. The review provides substantial information suggesting that without appropriate interventions, climate change and variability will affect agricultural yields, food security and add to the presently unaceptable levels of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some of them were already existing, the past decades have seen the development and promotion of climate-smart agriculture innovations such as the use of high yielding drought tolerant crop varieties, climate information services, agricultural insurance, agroforestry, water harvesting techniques, integrated soil fertility management practices, etc. In the context of climate change, this appears as a stepping up approach to sustainably improving farm productivity, rural livelihoods and adaptive capacity of farmers and production systems while contributing to mitigation. The development of regional, sub-regional and national climate change policies and plans targeted at mitigating climate change and improving adaptive capacity of the African people have also been developed to enable mainstreaming of climate-smart agriculture into agricultural development plans. Financial commitments from governments and development agencies will be crucial for improving large scale adoption of climate-smart agriculture.

AB  - Predictions from climate simulation models suggest that by 2050 mean temperatures on the Loess Plateau of China will increase by 2.5 to 3.75 degrees C, while those in the cropping region of south-west Australia will increase by 1.25 to 1.75 degrees C. By 2050, rainfall is not expected to change on the Loess Plateau of China, while in south-west Australia rainfall is predicted to decrease by 20 to 60 mm. The frequency of heat waves and dry spells is predicted to increase in both regions. The implications of rising temperatures are an acceleration of crop phenology and a reduction in crop yields, greater risk of reproductive failure from extreme temperatures, and greater risk of crop failure. The reduction in yield from increased phenological development can be countered by selecting longer-season cultivars and taking advantage of warmer minimum temperatures and reduced frost risk to plant earlier than with current temperatures. Breeding for tolerance of extreme temperatures will be necessary to counter the increased frequency of extreme temperatures, while a greater emphasis on breeding for increased drought resistance and precipitation-use efficiency will lessen the impact of reduced rainfall. Management options likely to be adopted in south-west Australia include the introduction of drought-tolerant perennial fodder species and shifting cropping to higher-rainfall areas. On the Loess Plateau of China, food security is paramount so that an increased area of heat-tolerant and high-yielding maize, mulching with residues and plastic film, better weed and pest control and strategic use of supplemental irrigation to improve rainfall-use efficiency are likely to be adopted.

AB  - With the increasing global water scarcity, efficient assessment methods for crop water stress have become a prerequisite to perform precision irrigation scheduling. The 1accessibility of infrared thermal sensor provides a powerful tool to detect and quantify crop water stress. This paper reviews the current practices of infrared thermal imagery utilized to assess crop water stress. Overall, three technological aspects of infrared thermal sensing applications for crop water stress assessment are reviewed along with the challenges and recommendations: (i) introduction of uncooled thermal camera and platforms, including ground-based platform and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) platforms, for thermal imaging acquisition, (ii) strategies of canopy segmentation in thermal imaging used to obtain average canopy temperature for CWSI calculation, (iii) correlation between three forms of crop water stress index (CWSI) i.e. theoretical CWSI (CWSIt), empirical CWSI (CWSIe), and statistic CWSI (CWSIs) and physiological indicators. The emphasis is on imaging process techniques for canopy segmentation in thermal imaging. As a future perspective, the potential use of deep learning approaches to assess crop water stress has been elaborated highlighting the future trends.

AB  - Drought is a major threat worldwide for crop production, especially due to the rapid climate changes. Current drought solutions involve improving irrigation system, rainwater harvesting, damming, cloud seeding, and changes of cultivation methods. Despite effective, each solution has economic, environmental, and temporal drawbacks. Among all solutions, the most effective, inexpensive and manageable method is the use of drought-tolerant cultivars via plant breeding. However, conventional plant breeding is a time-consuming and laborious task, especially for phenotypic data acquisition of target traits of numerous progenies. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is a recently developed method and has potential to overcome the mentioned issues. HTP offers massive, accurate, rapid, and automatic data acquisition in the breeding procedure and can be a breakthrough for developing drought resistant/tolerant cultivars. This study introduces various methods of HTP to detect drought stress, which can accelerate the breeding processes of drought-tolerant cultivars to provide helpful guidelines for breeders and researchers to choose appropriate methods.

AB  - Food production comes at an ecological cost, and the lack of sustainability of South Africa's crop production systems is becoming increasingly worrisome. While small scale emerging and homestead subsistence farming are significant in the agricultural sector, food production is dominated by large scale commercial agriculture. In this paper we analyse the ecological impact of South African commercial crop production and what can be done about it. Impact categories considered are divided into what we consider 'better-researched' problems: fresh water depletion, salinisation, soil degradation, eutrophication and land use change; and into what we consider 'emerging' problems for agriculture: greenhouse gas emissions, soil profile acidification, ecotoxicity and non-renewable resource consumption. While there is a paucity of quantitative information, it is clear that after decades of cultivation many of our agroecosystems are degraded or degrading. Sustainable crop production and food security are 'wicked' problems - containing dynamic social, economic and biophysical complexities. Increased stakeholder engagement to better understand these problems, the tradeoffs linked to finding solutions and to involve those with the resources to turn knowledge into action is required. Collecting key data, turning it into information within local contexts (involving the ecology, agronomy, sociology, psychology, economics and other disciplines simultaneously) and communicating it effectively to allow learning and adaptive management at various spatial and temporal scales is essential. An example is the display of river flows on a website in real-time to help farmers manage and adapt irrigation practices better, and to connect them with other stakeholders to improve understanding of the responsibilities of managing water at local and catchment scales.

AB  - Undoubtedly, high demands for food from the world-wide growing population are impacting the environment and putting many pressures on agricultural productivity. Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research.

AB  - In India, per capita availablity of water is reducing exponentially due to increasing population pressures and has declined from 5 300 m(3) in 1955 to 1 700 m(3) in the year 2000 against the world's average of 7 400 m(3) and Asian average of 3 240 m(3). The rainfed area (about 63% of the total geographical area) contributes only 45% to the national food basket due to inadequate and highly erratic rainfall while 37% of the irrigated area accounts for 55% of the total food production. As the scope of expanding irrigation potential is limited, effective water harvesting and management practices coupled with appropriate dryland technology are essential to increase the present production level of 2 10 M tonnes to 300 M tonnes by 2020. The gap between water supply and demands necessitates harnessing of available water resources with efficient water conservation and management techniques. It has been amply demonstrated that participatory water resource development in watershed management programmes has singificantly increased foodgrain and biomass production and resulted in moderation of floods, mitigation of droughts, augmentation of water ground recharge, employment generation and improvement of socio-economic conditions of the local people. The water harvesting practices include in-situ water conservation, micro-catchments, and ex-situ water harvesting and storage systems. Rainwater harvesting technologies are highly location specific and practices evolved in a given agro-ecological region have limited applicability in other regions. Of the various factors affecting water harvesting technology, rainfall is most important parameter due to its erratic temporal and spatial variations. The water harvesting practices in various parts of the country can, therefore,be best described based on agro-ecological regions which are having homogeneity in bio-physical attributes of soil, climate, toipography and landuses. This paper briefly describes the status of water harvesting techniques following the concept of watershed management in different agro-ecological regions of the country.

AB  - The management of mature macadamia orchards has evolved largely through the need to control inter-row crowding to maintain machinery access. The current study was undertaken to identify physiological constraints to production and priorities for future research and development. The two components of the study were a preliminary field study to determine the impact of current pruning and hedging management strategies on canopy photosynthetic performance and a literature review to identify physiological issues affecting orchard productivity.
   The field photosynthesis study demonstrated that emerging flush leaves have a negative light saturation net assimilation rate (A(max)) that increases to that of mature leaves (A(max) 8 - 10 mumol CO2/ m(2). s) over 28 days. Leaf age has no effect on A(max) of light-adapted leaves. Shade-adapted macadamia leaves cannot attain the photosynthetic capacity of light-adapted leaves. This means that a late hedging strategy to remove around 1 m of canopy from the side of trees to improve orchard access reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the orchard until sufficient flushing occurs to restore the canopy.
   The literature review focussed on light interception and distribution, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and nitrogen cycling, environmental response, flowering and fruit set, nut abscission, canopy management, and nutrition and disease control. Light interception modelling work, which has been widely adopted for deciduous temperate fruit crops, has immediate application to macadamia production and can explain many of the yield responses recorded by macadamias to canopy management. Macadamia yields appear to increase up to about 96% light interception. Variation in light distribution within canopies that affects the yield and quality of temperate crops is also a present problem with macadamias. It leads to uneven distribution of leaf and fruit throughout the canopy and to a heavily shaded void developing in the middle of trees. The relationship between irradiance, leaf photosynthetic capacity and longevity, flushing,flowering, and fruit set is poorly understood. No information is available on the training of young trees to improve light distribution and canopy photosynthetic efficiency.
   The current practice of light annual hedging of mature macadamias appears to restrict the production of fruiting wood. Earlier nut abscission can be achieved by the use of ethephon, which offers greater flexibility in the timing of hedging. Research work is required on the effects of timing, frequency and severity of hedging on fruiting wood production, flowering, and fruit set of macadamias. Information on the need to supplement mechanical hedging with manual pruning to improve light distribution throughout canopies is also required.
   The cyclical and highly variable nature of macadamia yields needs to be further analysed to determine whether a consistent pattern exists and whether environmental factors are an influence. A simple measure of the storage levels of the major assimilates, carbohydrates and nitrogen compounds, is unlikely to predict cyclical yield patterns because both are continually cycled within the tree and it appears that, from comprehensive studies on another evergreen fruit crop, avocado, the major supply of carbohydrate during the fruit-filling stage is from current photosynthesis.
   Several studies have failed to demonstrate irrigation responses by field-grown macadamias. The cyclical and variable yield of macadamias demonstrates that yield responses from field experiments cannot be expected in less than 5 years, even assuming adequate plot size, buffering, and replication. On the drier sites with light-textured soils in south-eastern Queensland, yield responses could be expected.
   Following the success of temperate fruit tree crop breeding programs and trends with other evergreen tree crops, macadamia breeding needs to focus on dwarfing clonal rootstocks that provide uniformity, and vigour control to improve cropping efficiency, to reduce canopy management costs and to minimise the reduction in yield following tree topping.

Higher root biomass, root oxidation activity, and cytokinin contents in roots are required for achieving more panicle number, more spikelets per panicle, greater grain-filling percentage, and higher grain yield. However, these root traits are not linearly correlated with yield components. When these traits reach very high levels, grain filling and grain yield are not necessarily enhanced. High numbers of mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and amyloplasts in root tip cells benefit root and shoot growth and yield formation. Proper crop management, such as an alternate wetting and moderate soil drying irrigation, can significantly improve ultra-structure of root tip cells, increase root length density and concentration of cytokinins in root bleedings, and consequently, increase grain-filling percentage, grain yield, and water use efficiency. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism underlying root-shoot and root-soil interactions for high grain yield, the roles of root-sourced hormones in regulating crop growth and development and the effects of soil moisture and nutrient management on the root architecture and physiology.

AB  - As food supply is one of the most important issues for national security, forecasting agricultural production represents a necessity for every country. Forecasting yields and production volume is a very complex task that requires both application of formal statistical methods and assessment of experts. Considering not only the significant role of maize in the immediate diet and processing industry in the Republic of Serbia, but also its absolute dominance in the structure of sown areas, the analysis of the time series and projections of future maize yield were carried out. Maize yield projections obtained through Box-Jenkins methodology, for 2017 and 2018, are 4.97 t/ha and 7.01 t/ha. Comparing the projected with realized yield in 2017 (for which there is available data), it was noticed that the model's forecast indicated a smaller reduction than actually realized. According to the results of the conducted study, it is clear that although the time series model cannot anticipate precise yield quantities, it can certainly be useful in terms of predicting future tendencies in maize yield oscillations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cocoa is an important commodity crop and source of income for millions of small-holder farmers. Nonetheless, questions on cocoa tree functioning, best management practices and climate change responses remain. Modelling is a powerful tool to address these questions, complementing experimental work that is expensive and time consuming due to the long productive cycle of the cocoa system. However, compared to other crops, cocoa modelling has not received as much attention. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed existing cocoa models and identified the main gaps in the literature and possible strategies to advance models of cocoa production. METHODS: We first classified relevant research questions in cocoa production along three main axes (funda-mental-applied, spatial organization, prediction horizon) and aligned modelling approaches along these. We then reviewed six published cocoa models using these axes as framework. This comparison revealed several modelling gaps for which we provide an overview of data availability for future model development. RESULTS: (i) Several plant processes (i.e., water stress responses, respiration, climate change responses, nutrient effects and phenology) are either missing from existing cocoa models or are simulated based on general plant physiological knowledge rather than cocoa-specific knowledge. (ii) The only currently existing 3D model of cocoa architecture has very limited scope and does not include physiological processes. (iii) There are no model -based decision support tools available for supporting the main management practices such as irrigation, fertil-ization and pruning. (iv) Data for model calibration and validation are often scarce. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that data availability for model design, calibration and validation is currently the main bottleneck for further development of cocoa models. Extensive cooperation within the cocoa research community and a large network of long-term experiments under different climatic and management conditions are required to close the identified modelling gaps.

AB  - Many regions of the world are predicted to experience water scarcity due to more frequent and more severe droughts and increased water demands. Water use efficiency by plants can be negatively affected by soil water repellency (SWR). It is timely to review existing techniques to remedy SWR. Ideally remediation addresses the origins of a problem. However, the fundamental mechanisms of how and why SWR develops are still poorly understood. In this review it was hypothesized that SWR occurs where the balance of input-decomposition of organic matter is impaired, due to either increased input or decreased decomposition rates of hydrophobic substances. Direct and indirect strategies to remedy SWR were distinguished. While direct remediation aims at abolishing the causes of SWR, indirect strategies seek to manage sites with SWR by treating its symptoms. The 12 reviewed strategies include applying surfactants, clay, slow-release fertilizers, lime, and fungicides, bioremediation of SWR through stimulating earthworms, choosing adapted vegetation, irrigation, cultivation, soil aeration and compaction. Some of the techniques have been applied successfully only in laboratory experiments. Our review highlights that it is not straightforward to cure SWR based on easily measurable and site-specific soil and vegetation properties, and that long-term, large-scale field experiments are required to improve the understanding of the evolution of SWR as cornerstone to develop cost-effective and efficient remediation strategies. We also identified current research gaps around the diagnosis and prevention of SWR (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rice in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia (the Mekong region) is grown mostly as a mono crop once a year in the wet season in the rainfed lowlands. Somelowland areas have access to irrigation water, and rice double cropping is practised while non-rice crops are grown in a limited area in the dry season after harvesting wet season rice. In all cases wet season rice is grown mostly for subsistence under rainfed with low input, and combined with low soil fertility and frequent occurrence of drought, the yield is generally low with a mean of 2.5 t/ha and the yield increase was slow in recent years. More recently demand for labour in the regional centres has caused labour shortages in the rural area and rice crops may not be managed in the traditional manner such as the practice of manually transplanting of rice seedlings. For the last two decades research efforts have been made to minimise the adverse effect of abiotic factors and to meet the changing nature of the socioeconomic environment, resulting in increased understanding of factors determining productivity of rainfed lowland rice and the cropping systems based on it. This review describes such achievements in five sections-water environment characterisation to quantify drought problems, soil environment and fertiliser management, direct seeding to develop technology to cope with the labour shortage, variety improvement for rainfed lowland rice in drought-prone environment, and crop intensification and diversification that shift practices from traditional subsistence agriculture to more market-oriented agriculture. Each section is concluded with issues for future research need. The last section of the paper describes future research challenges for the rainfed rice-based lowland cropping systems in the Mekong region and possible implication on rainfed lowland rice system on other regions.

AB  - Even small increases in the large pool of soil organic carbon could result in large reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentrations sufficient to limit global warming below the threshold of 2 degrees C required for climate stability. Globally, grasslands occupy 70% of the world's agricultural area, so interventions to farm management practices to reduce losses or increase soil carbon stocks in grassland are highly relevant. Here, we review the literature with particular emphasis on New Zealand and report on the effects of management practices on changes in soil carbon stocks for temperate grazed grasslands. We include findings from models that explore the trade-offs between multiple desirable outcomes, such as increasing soil carbon stocks and milk production.
   Farm management practices can affect soil carbon stocks through changes in net primary production, the proportions of biomass removed, the degree of stabilisation of carbon in the soil and changes to the rate of soil carbon decomposition. The carbon saturation deficit defines the potential for a soil to stabilise additional carbon. Earlier reviews have concluded that, while labile carbon is the dominant substrate for soil carbon decomposition, a fraction of soil carbon stocks is stabilised and protected from decomposition by the formation of organomineral complexes. Recent evidence shows that the rate of organic carbon decomposition is determined primarily by the extent of soil organic carbon protection and, therefore, the availability of substrates to microbial activity.
   New Zealand grassland systems have moderate to high soil carbon stocks in the surface layers (i.e., upper 0.15 m) where most roots are located, so the carbon saturation deficit is relatively low and the scope to increase soil carbon stocks by carbon inputs from primary production may be limited. International studies have shown that the addition of fertilisers, feed imports, and applications of manure and effluent can increase soil carbon stocks, especially for degraded soils, but the responses in New Zealand soils are uncertain because of the limited number of studies. However, recent evidence shows that irrigation can reduce soil carbon stocks in New Zealand, but neither the processes nor the long-term trends are known. Studies of sward renewal have shown that shortterm losses of carbon losses resulting from the disturbance can be mitigated using rapid replacement of the new sward, minimum tillage and avoidance of times when the soil water content is high. Swards comprising multiple species have also shown that soil carbon stocks may be increased after periods of several years. Model simulations have shown that the goal of increasing both soil carbon and milk production could be achieved best by increasing carbon inputs from supplementary animal feed. However, losses of carbon at feed export sites need to be minimised to achieve overall net gains in soil carbon. Grazing intensity can have a big influence on soil carbon stocks but the magnitude and direction of the effects are not consistent between studies.
   Biochar addition could possibly increase soil carbon stocks but it is not yet an economical option for large scale application in New Zealand. There is some evidence that the introduction of earthworms and dung beetles could potentially increase soil carbon stabilisation, but the greenhouse gas benefits are confounded by possible increases in nitrous oxide emissions. The new practice of full inversion tillage during grassland renewal has the potential to increase soil carbon stocks under suitable conditions but full life-cycle analysis including the effects of the disruptive operations has yet to be completed.
   We conclude with a list of criteria that determine the success and suitability of management options to increase soil carbon stocks and identify priority research questions that need to be addressed using experimental and modelling approaches to optimise management options to increase soil carbon stocks.

AB  - Green colour, texture and thy matter are important attributes to appreciate freshness and quality in spinach. However, there is currently no fast, economical and non-destructive method which allows producers to measure these parameters simultaneously in the plant, in a matter of seconds. However, Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy might bridge this gap. NIR spectra of intact spinach leaves and modified partial least square regression models were developed for colour (a* and b*), texture (maximum fracture force, toughness, stiffness and displacement) and dry matter. A calibration equation with a high prediction performance was devised for dry matter content (r(cv)(2), = 0.74), while calibration models for all the textural parameters analysed were considered suitable for screening purposes (r(cv)(2) > 0.6). For colour-related parameters, the models allowed test samples to be rough screened. We, therefore, suggest that the analysis of green colour, texture and dry matter of spinach leaves in situ, on the plant, using NIRS technology could prove to be a valuable tool for optimizing cultural practices such as fertilization and irrigation and to assess the quality of the spinach leaves when harvested.

AB  - Agriculture plays a decisive role in the survival of humankind. The efficient and precise regulation of agriculture will ensure the welfare of people throughout the world. However, difficult and urgent agricultural challenges persist, and traditional agricultural production regulation methods are time consuming and laborious. Moreover, the application of intelligent algorithms to modern agricultural production requires the support of a database, which can be complex and difficult to use in practice and requires a large amount of computing. Fortunately, model predictive control (MPC) methods can achieve highly accurate control operations with moderate complexity and can also allow for rolling optimization in a limited time domain, which improves precision. Despite being a process control method that originated in industry, MPC is highly suited for application in agriculture because it can effectively address nonlinear and large time-delay systems. The aim of this review is to introduce MPC and describe its current application in agriculture. In this review, the development of MPC and various improved MPC schemes are described. The development of MPC is divided into three stages. In addition, applications and new technologies associated with MPC in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production, product processing and greenhouses are analyzed. Smart agriculture will have a promising future because of the implementation of MPC technologies derived from successful industrial applications. Finally, challenges and future perspectives of MPC technology use in agriculture are summarized and forecasted.

AB  - Environmental problems related to the use of synthetic fertilizers and to organic waste management have led to increased interest in the use of organic materials as an alternative source of nutrients for crops, but this is also associated with N2O emissions. There has been an increasing amount of research into the effects of using different types of fertilization on N2O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, but the findings have sometimes been rather contradictory. Available information also suggests that water management could exert a high influence on N2O emissions. In this context, we have reviewed the current scientific knowledge, including an analysis of the effect of fertilizer type and water management on direct N2O emissions.
   A meta-analysis of compliant reviewed experiments revealed significantly lower N2O emissions for organic as opposed to synthetic fertilizers (23% reduction). When organic materials were segregated in solid and liquid, only solid organic fertilizer emissions were significantly lower than those of synthetic fertilizers (28% reduction in cumulative emissions). The EF is similar to the IPCC factor in conventionally irrigated systems (0.98% N2O-N N applied(-1)), but one order of magnitude lower in rainfed systems (0.08%). Drip irrigation produces intermediate emission levels (0.66%). Differences are driven by Mediterranean agro-climatic characteristics, which include low soil organic matter (SOM) content and a distinctive rainfall and temperature pattern. Interactions between environmental and management factors and the microbial processes involved in N2O emissions are discussed in detail.
   Indirect emissions have not been fully accounted for, but when organic fertilizers are applied at similar N rates to synthetic fertilizers, they generally make smaller contributions to the leached NO3- pool. The most promising practices for reducing N2O through organic fertilization include: (i) minimizing water applications; (ii) minimizing bare soil; (iii) improving waste management; and (iv) tightening N cycling through N immobilization. The mitigation potential may be limited by: (i) residual effect; (ii) the long-term effects of fertilizers on SOM; (iii) lower yield-scaled performance; and (iv) total N availability from organic sources. Knowledge gaps identified in the review included: (i) insufficient sampling periods; (ii) high background emissions; (iii) the need to provide N2O EF and yield-scaled EF; (iv) the need for more research on specific cropping systems; and (v) the need for full GHG balances.
   In conclusion, the available information suggests a potential of organic fertilizers and water-saving practices to mitigate N2O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, although further research is needed before it can be regarded as fully proven, understood and developed.

AB  - Service crops are crops grown with the aim of providing non-marketed ecosystem services, i.e. differing from food, fiber and fuel production. Vineyard soils face various agronomic issues such as poor organic carbon levels, erosion, fertility losses, and numerous studies have highlighted the ability of service crops to address these issues. In addition to their ability to increase soil organic matter and fertility, and reduce runoff and erosion processes, service crops provide a large variety of ecosystem services in vineyards such as weed control, pest and disease regulation, water supply, water purification, improvement of field trafficability and maintenance of soil biodiversity. However, associating service crops with grapevines may also generate disservices and impair grape production: competition for soil resources with the grapevine is often highlighted to reject such association. Consequently, vinegrowers have to find a balance between services and disservices, depending on local soil and climate conditions, on their objectives of grape production and on the nature and temporality of the ecosystem services they expect during the grapevine cycle. This study proposes a review of the services and disservices provided by service crops in vineyards, and a framework for their management. Vinegrowers' production objectives and pedoclimatic constraints form the preliminary stage to consider before defining a strategy of service crop management. This strategy assembles management options such as the choice of species, its spatial distribution within the vineyard, the timing of its installation, maintenance and destruction. These management options, defined for both annual and long-term time scales, form action levers which may impact cropping system functioning. Finally, we underline the importance of implementing an adaptive strategy at the seasonal time scale. Such tactical management allows adapting the cropping system to observed climate and state of the biophysical system during the grapevine cycle, in order to provide targeted services and achieve satisfactory production objectives.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-armed bandits, is a branch of machine learning that deals with the problem of sequential decision-making in uncertain and unknown environments through learning by practice. While best known for being the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) world's best Go game player, RL has a vast range of potential applications. RL may help to address some of the criticisms leveled against crop management decision support systems (DSS): it is an interactive, geared towards action, contextual tool to evaluate series of crop operations faced with uncertainties. A review of RL use for crop management DSS reveals a limited number of contributions. We profile key prospects for a human-centered, real-world, interactive RL-based system to face tomorrow's agricultural decisions, and theoretical and ongoing practical challenges that may explain its current low uptake. We argue that a joint research effort from the RL and agronomy communities is necessary to explore RL's full potential.
